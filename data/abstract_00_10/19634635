The present paper describes the antibiotic related activities of Hungarian adult intensive care units (ICUs) and their parent hospitals, specially focusing on the role of hospital pharmacists. Information was gathered by a structured questionnaire, which was sent to the head of ICU departments by post and by email. The multidisciplinary team of authors developed and validated the questions. Results were compared to recommendations set up by the Antibiotic Resistance Prevention And Control (ARPAC) project. Minimal requirements appointed by the ARPAC have not been fulfilled by many aspects: multidisciplinary hospital commitees were not realized and the activity of these committees in antibiotic guideline developments was not satisfactory. Continuous education and calculation of standardized antibiotic use was rarely performed at ICUs. The role of pharmacist remained marginal in every field. All these findings suggest the need for appointment of a responsible, multidisciplinary antibiotic manamement team including also a pharmacist.
