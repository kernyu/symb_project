Regional differences of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in the fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and enterococci were determined in different cities in the south, west, and north of The Netherlands. In 1999, differences in antibiotic consumption were observed between the different regions: 11.19, 10.84, and 7.16 DDD (defined daily dosage) per 1,000 inhabitants per day, respectively. No significant regional differences were found in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance for both E. coli and enterococci. However, the differences in antibiotic consumption observed might lead to changes in antibiotic resistance in the near future. Surveillance of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance is strongly recommended to control the development of antibiotic resistance because it provides epidemiological data to set up and control antibiotic guidelines.
