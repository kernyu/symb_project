Gendine is a novel antiseptic dye with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that may be used to coat plastics and metal devices. Our objective was to determine the efficacy of gendine-coated orthopaedic metal devices in preventing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonisation. Stainless steel and titanium Schanz rods were coated with gendine. The zone of inhibition (ZoI) around the rods with and without gamma-irradiation was determined by a modified Kirby-Bauer method. A previously published bioprosthetic biofilm colonisation model, modified Kuhn's method, was used to determine the adherence of MRSA to coated and uncoated rods, with and without irradiation, after insertion into bovine bone and after 3 months shelf life followed by 2 weeks of immersion in serum. The gendine-coated Schanz metal rods showed a net ZoI of 16 mm against MRSA before and after irradiation. Gendine-coated rods showed no biofilm formation (0 colony-forming units (CFU)), which was a significant reduction (P<0.001) compared with uncoated controls (>5000 CFU). Coated rods exposed to high-dose gamma-irradiation and coated rods drilled into bone also showed significant efficacy (P<0.001) in preventing biofilm adherence. After 2 weeks, gendine-coated rods maintained significant durability (P<0.01), resulting in 90% reduction in MRSA biofilm adherence compared with uncoated control rods. Results indicate that gendine-coated metal rods are highly efficacious in the prevention of MRSA biofilm.
