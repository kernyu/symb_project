Macrophage migration inhibitory factor plays an important role in inflammatory diseases. We investigated the role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in the development of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis using MIF null ((-/-)) mice. MIF(-/-) mice given 3% DSS showed no clinical and histological feature of colitis in contrast to wild-type (WT) mice. Lack of MIF suppressed the up-regulation of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma as Th1-derived cytokines, and increased the level of IL-4 as Th2-derived cytokine in the colon tissues. Moreover, we found that the expressions of heat shock protein (HSP)40 and HSP70 were markedly up-regulated in the colon of MIF(-/-) mice in response to DSS compared with WT mice. Additionally, quercetin, an inhibitor of HSP synthesis, inhibited the up-regulation of HSP40 and 70 expressions and developed DSS-induced colitis in MIF(-/-) mice. Our findings in this study provide more information in the role of MIF in colitis.
