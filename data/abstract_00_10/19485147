BACKGROUND: Private medical practitioners manage substantial number of children with urinary tract infection in Nigeria. It is important to evaluate the management of urinary tract infection (UTI), because of complications that may arise form improper treatment. METHODS: This study was conducted during the 10th Annual General and Scientific Conference of Guild of Medical Directors in Kano. Study populations were private medical practitioners. The research tools were self administered questionnaires containing questions to illicit knowledge, attitude and treatment regarding childhood UTI. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty respondents returned their questionnaire. There were 98 (81.7%) males and 22 (18.2%) females. Twenty one (17.5%) had postgraduate qualification. Majority (87.5%) respondents preferred early morning and mid-stream urine for patients. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis were the commonest listed isolates. The knowledge of predisposing factors and complications following UTI was fair. Twenty-six percent would give chemoprophylaxis for repeat infections in females while only 7% would refer such patients to specialist. Reasons that warranted referral varied from inability to pay fees to the occurrence of complications in the course of therapy. Twenty-nine percent would use multiple therapy (antibiotics) because of the need to ensure adequate antimicrobial coverage, effective therapy and prevention of resistance and cost effectiveness. Ampicillin, Cotrimazole and Tetracycline featured as first line antibiotics among the respondents. CONCLUSION: Some practices are clearly at variance with recommendations. Continue medical education is recommended for bridging the gap between current practices, this will enhance patient's care.
