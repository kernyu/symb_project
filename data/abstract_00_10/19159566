OBJECTIVES: To search for an ideal therapeutic regimen for multidrug resistant tuberculosis conforming to the situation of China. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-four patients with rifampin-resistant tuberculosis, 114 multi-drug resistant (MDR-TB) and 40 resistant to other drugs, in Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, and Shenzhen, 107 males and 47 females, aged 39 (19-77), were randomly divided into 2 groups: 85 patients in the group of drug-resistant regimen, 3RFT AM Ofx Pto PAS-INH/5RFT Ofx Pto PAS-INH regimen, including rifapentine (RFT), amikacin (Am), ofloxacin (Ofx), protionamide (Pto), para-aminosalicylic acid-isoniazid (PAS-INH) for 3 months and then RFT, Ofx, Pto, and PAS-INH for 5 months, and 69 in the retreatment regimen group undergoing 3 H3R3Z3E3S3/5 H3R3E3, including isoniazid (H), rifampin (R), pyrazinamide (Z), ethambutol (E), and streptomycin (S) for 3 months and then H, R, and E for 5 months. Sputum smear was checked and the sputum smear conversion rate was calculated as an effective treatment indicator 3, 6, and 8 months later. RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen of the 154 patients were treated for a good 8 months. The sputum smear conversion rate 8 months after treatment of the drug-resistant regimen group was 65.9% (56/85), significantly higher than that of the retreatment regimen group [40.6% (28/69), chi2 = 9.834, P = 0.002]. Eighty-five of the 114 MDR-TB patients had been treated for a good 8 months with a sputum smear conversion rate of 61.8% (42/68), significantly higher than that of the retreatment regimen group [39.1% (18/46), chi2 = 5.638, P = 0.018]. Sputum smear conversion at the end of the 8th month was related to age, course of disease, therapeutic regimen, and the type of drug-resistance (all P < 0.05). The side-effect rate of the drug-resistant regimen group was 23.9% (17/71), higher than that of the retreatment regimen group [18.6% (8/43)], but not significantly (chi2 = 0.446, P = 0.504). CONCLUSION: The drug-resistant regimen recommended above is more effective than the retreatment regimen and should be considered in the areas where the WHO guideline fails to be followed or drug sensitivity test (DST) cannot be conducted and adjusted according to the results of DST and treatment.
