OBJECTIVE: To research DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia clinical isolates with different resistant levels of quinolone susceptibility. METHODS: We selected five strains for which the MIC of ciprofloxacin were higher than 2 mg/L and were negative for efflux mechanism; then we amplified their QRDRs of gyrA and parE, purified the fragment, and analyzed the nucleotide sequences. RESULTS: In Stenotrophomonas maltophilia DNA gyrA, the changes at positions 83 and 87 commonly involved in quinolones resistance in gram-negative bacteria were absent, and there was Gln but not Ser or Thr. Of the five strains, one strain showed a ParE amino acid change in position 402, the other was in position 432, but the mutations were not associated with FQNS resistance. CONCLUSION: FQNS resistance in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is related to active efflux pump and may be correlated with a low level of permeability. But it is not clear whether the resistance is related to the mutants in DNA gyrase and topoisomerase N.
