Tetracycline, doxycycline, streptomycin and rifampicin were used for prophylaxis of experimental plague in albino mice (Yersinia pestis 231, approximately 1000 LD50). The antibiotics were administered 5 hours after the infection for 5 days. Tetracycline and doxycycline provided survival of 60 to 75% of the animals, while the respective figure for streptomycin and rifampicin was 100%, but streptomycin and rifampicin inhibited development of plague immunity evident from a lower protection index (PI) by 3-4 orders. The PI for the tetracyclines lowered by 2 orders. Simultaneous prophylaxis with the tetracyclines and immunization by Y. pestis EV Rifr R(SmTc) (10(6) microbial cells) provided not only higher percentage of the animal survival (80-90%) but also development of sufficient plague immunity: PI of 1.0 x 10(5)--5.0 x 10(5). When the animals were infected with Y. pestis 231 R(SmTc) the use of the tetracyclines failed, whereas the use of doxycycline and simultaneous vaccination by EV Rifr R(SmTc) provided survival of 70-85% of the animals. Successive use of inefficient streptomycin (for 2 days) and efficient rifampicin (for 3 days) provided survival only of 30% of the mice. A similar regimen of the successive use of the inefficient and efficient antibiotics (the total term of 5 days) started simultaneously with immunization by EV Rifr R(SmTc) provided survival of 80% of the animals. The use of combined specific and urgent prophylaxis of plague infection due not only to antibiotic susceptible but also to antibiotic resistant strains of the plague pathogen was shown promising.
