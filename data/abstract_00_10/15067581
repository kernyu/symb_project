In Gram negative bacteria, hydrophilic antibiotics such as beta-lactams and fluoroquinolons used the bacterial porin channel during their entry. The balance of the porin expression level and the molecular parameters which govern the molecule diffusion through the pore are important physiological points. Acquired in vivo beta-lactam resistance is often associated with porin loss, and recently clinical resistant strains synthetizing mutated porin have been described. These data highlight both the importance of the channel characteristics and the amino acid residues involved in the drug diffusion process. In addition, several mechanisms, including various repressors or activators as well as molecules inhibiting the pore synthesis or activity, argue for the complexity and plasticity of the bacterial control of porin function. All these aspects play a key role in both membrane permeability and efficiency of the antibiotic resistance process.
