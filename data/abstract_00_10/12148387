INCREASINGLY WIDESPREAD USE OF THE NEW FLUOROQUINOLONES: For the treatment of airway infections raises the risk of bacterial resistance, particularly for Streptococcus pneumoniae. IN FRANCE, PRESCRIPTIONS FOR QUINOLONES: Are much less frequent than in several other large countries. This is also true for anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolones although prescriptions have increased moderately over the last year. FURTHER TO THE CONCERNS RESULTING: From the publication of two studies from Canada and Hong Kong in 1999 that suggested an increasing rate of fluoroquinolone resistant pneumocci, it has been established that the real rate of isolation of resistant strains remains very low, particularly in France, while the rate of penicillin and macrolide resistant strains has been more than 50% in most studies. S. PNEUMONIAE RESISTANCE: Basically results from chromosomal mutations that inhibit the affinity of fluoroquinolones for intrabacterial targets (topoisomerase i.v. and gyrase DNA), or increase active exflux. ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT OUTLOOK IS RATHER OPTIMISTIC: It is nevertheless indispensable to implement preventive measures for prescriptions and personal health care in order to limit the emergence and dissemination of fluoroquinolone-resistant penumococcal strains.
