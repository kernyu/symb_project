A total of 48 clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium were tested for their susceptibility to glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and teicoplanin). We observed a low-level of resistance to vancomycin (phenotype Van B) for 4.2% isolates. MICs for these strains were MIC(vancomycin) = 8 mg/L and MIC(teicoplanin) = 0,75 mg/L. Among all of the tested strains, 66.7% were resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotics (phenotype HLAR).
