The structure of the extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) produced by Erwinia chrysanthemi strain A2148 has been determined using low pressure size-exclusion and anion-exchange chromatographies, high pH anion-exchange chromatography, glycosyl-linkage analysis, and 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy. The polysaccharide is structurally similar, if not identical, to the EPS produced by E. chrysanthemi strain A350. A streptomycin-resistant strain of E. chrysanthemi Ech6 (Ech6S(+)) has been generated and has an elevated production of EPS, as does a streptomycin-resistant strain (Ech9Sm6) of E. chrysanthemi Ech9. These modified E. chrysanthemi spp. have been ribotyped and found to be closely related to their parent strains.
