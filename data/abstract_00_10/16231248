Among 777 patients transferred to 4 hospitals in Bangkok from southern Thailand after the tsunami of 26 December 2004, there were 515 with skin and soft-tissue infections. The most common organisms isolated were Aeromonas species (145 [22.6%] of 641 isolates from 305 patients). Most isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides, third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, quinolones, and imipenem but were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and first-generation cephalosporins.
