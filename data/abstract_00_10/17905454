In this study the susceptibility of 58 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) strains and 58 Staphylococcus aureus strains to oxacillin was evaluated by a novel method called quantitative disk diffusion (DD) method. The results obtained were compared to phenotypic methods as agar dilution (AD) for oxacillin, disk diffusion (DD) for cefoxitin, and related to the presence of the mecA gene detected by PCR. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) determined by the quantitative DD method were equivalent to MICs determined in the AD method for S. aureus (Student's t test, p=0.99) and CoNS (Student's t test, p=0.97). Incongruent results between PCR mecA gene determinations and the quantitative DD method were obtained in 8 strains (5 S. aureus and 3 CoNS) where the mecA gene expression was blocked. However, oxacillin resistance was detected by the proposed method even in staphylococci strains showing low-level or heterogeneous resistance to the antibiotic while other phenotypic methods failed. The single quantitative DD method is not expensive, it can be performed in any laboratory and permits accurate identification of oxacillin resistant staphylococci.
