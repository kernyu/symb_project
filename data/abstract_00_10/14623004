Antimicrobial compounds incorporating oxazolidinone and quinolone pharmacophore substructures have been synthesized and evaluated. Representative analogues 2, 5, and 6 display an improved potency versus linezolid against gram-positive and fastidious gram-negative pathogens. The compounds are also active against linezolid- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium strains. The MOA for these new antimicrobials is consistent with a combination of protein synthesis and gyrase A/topoisomerase IV inhibition, with a structure-dependent degree of the contribution from each inhibitory mechanism.
