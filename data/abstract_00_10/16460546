Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae is a key factor in the development of invasive disease and the spread of resistant strains within the community. A single nasopharyngeal swab was obtained from 648 unvaccinated children aged <5 years, either healthy or with acute respiratory tract infection or meningitis, during the winters of 2000 and 2001. The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 35.8% (95% CI 32.1-39.6). The pneumococcal serotypes found most frequently in the nasopharynx were 14, 6B, 6A, 19F, 10A, 23F and 18C, which included five of the seven serotypes in the currently licensed seven-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7); serotypes 4 and 9V were less common. Serotypes 1 and 5 were isolated rarely from the nasopharynx. A comparison of 222 nasopharyngeal isolates with 125 invasive isolates, matched for age and time to the carrier isolates, showed a similar prevalence of penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci (PNSp) (19.8% and 19.2%, respectively). PNSp serotypes were similar (6B, 14, 19F, 19 A, 23B and 23F) for carriage and invasive disease isolates. The coverage of PCV7 for carriage isolates (52.2%) and invasive isolates (62.4%) did not differ significantly (p 0.06); similarly, there was no significant difference in PCV7 coverage for carriage isolates (34.5%) and invasive isolates (28.2%) of PNSp. These data suggest that PCV7 has the potential to reduce pneumococcal carriage and the number of carriers of PNSp belonging to vaccine serotypes.
