Meningitis caused by Salmonella species is not uncommon in many developing countries. Patients suspected of bacterial meningitis who were admitted to Siriraj Hospital were enrolled in this study during 1986-2001. There were only 19 cases of Salmonella meningitis. Salmonella serogroup D ranked first, followed by serogroup C, serogroup B and then serogroup H. Most patients were children under 1 year of age. The antimicrobial susceptibility pattern for Salmonella meningitis may provide a guideline for the selection of appropriate drug treatment.
