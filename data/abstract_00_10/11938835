OBJECTIVE: To verify the therapeutic effect of Xiaochaihu decoction (XCHD) on chronic hepatitis B, and to prove the rationality of the TCM principle "strengthening the body resistance to eliminate pathogenic factors". METHODS: The inhibitory effects on DHBV of various doses of XCHD and its ingredients (grouped into whole recipe, partial recipe and single Bupleurum) were determined and compared, as well as compared with that of the blank control and of antiviral drug, acyclovir (ACV). RESULTS: Inhibitory effect was shown in all the treated groups. The treatment by whole recipe of XCHD with the dose 20 times that of clinical use showed the optimal effect, the difference in comparing with other treated groups was significant, P < 0.05. The effect of whole recipe was better than that of the partial recipe or single Bupleurum, P < 0.05. Moreover, the effect was rather persistent, no rebound phenomena was observed after withdrawal of medication, while in the ACV treated group, though a better effect conld be obeained, however, the DHBV returned to the level of before treatment after cessation of ACV treatment. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic effect of XCHD might be to supplment body resistance and remove the evil pathogen, strengthen or regular immune function, so XCHD is efficient in treating chronic hepatitis B.
