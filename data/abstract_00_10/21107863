Artemether is an artemisinin derivative that is used as an antimalarial drug, especially in situations where chloroquine resistance is suspected. This compound has proved to be a good prophylactic agent against schistosomiasis japonica in China. In the present study, the therapeutic efficacies of different artemether-dosing protocols were evaluated in experimentally infected mice harbouring adult Schistosoma mansoni (Egyptian strain). Mice were treated on day 46 onwards with three dosing protocols (400 mg/kg/day for 2 days; 200 mg/kg/day for 4 days; 100 mg/kg/day for 6 days) after being infected. A number of parasitological and histopathological criteria were employed in the assessment of drug efficacies compared to infected untreated control 2 weeks post-treatment. The results of the present study suggest that artemether is efficacious against the Egyptian strain of S. mansoni with total worm reductions ranging from 40.7% to 59.7% and female worm reductions ranging from 69.3% to >90%. In addition, artemether induced significant reductions, ranging from 75.2% to 82.6%, in the liver tissue egg loads as well as significant reductions, ranging from 68.8% to 78.9% in the intestinal wall egg loads. It also induced significant alterations in the oogram pattern in the intestinal mucosa of infected mice with cessation of oviposition and increased rates of dead eggs. Antipathologic activities were also evident in the amelioration of granulomas in the liver with increased ratios of healed to active ones. In conclusion, artemether could be a promising agent in the control of schistosomiasis mansoni due to its schistosomicidal effects on female worms and to its ovicidal power as well as its potentiality in the improvement of hepatic lesions.
