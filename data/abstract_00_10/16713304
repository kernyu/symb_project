RTG-P1 cells are a rainbow trout fibroblastic cell line permanently transfected with the luciferase gene under the control of the Mx promoter. On exposure to interferon (IFN) or IFN inducing agents, the cells produce luciferase. IPNV did not induce luciferase production up to 24h post-infection but did not suppress constitutive luciferase production. Furthermore, IPNV suppressed luciferase production induced by poly I:C. RT-PCR analysis of IPNV infected cells showed IFN gene transcription from 6h post-infection with increasing expression up to 24h. Housekeeping genes beta-actin and GAPDH were also expressed along with upregulation of IRF1 and slight upregulation of STAT1. When RTG-P1 cells were stimulated with IFN, Mx transcripts, measured by qRT-PCR, peaked at 3-6h and thereafter fell to low levels, but in the presence of IPNV, Mx transcription at this time was significantly suppressed but continued to rise gradually. Luciferase production was lower in infected cells at 12h post-infection but not significantly after 24h. These results indicate that, in non-stimulated RTG-P1 cells, while IPNV induces IFN transcription, activation of Mx expression is suppressed. Furthermore, when stimulated by IFN, the rate of Mx transcription is significantly suppressed by the virus. This would probably give time for the virus to replicate rapidly in the early phases of infection. Contrary to the fibroblastic cell line, IPNV stimulated IFN production by salmon macrophages in vitro at least as strongly as poly I:C, with no suppression of the IFN response to poly I:C, and the virus persisted for up to 9 days without causing CPE.
