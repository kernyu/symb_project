OBJECTIVE: To describe the recent trends in demographic, clinical and microbiological characteristics and outcome of treatment in paediatric cases of tuberculosis. DESIGN: National surveillance study. SETTING: England and Wales. PATIENTS: All children under the age of 16 years reported with tuberculosis to the national enhanced surveillance system between 1999 and 2006 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions, and rates of disease, by demographic characteristics, site of disease, diagnostic delay, culture confirmation, species, drug susceptibility and treatment outcome. RESULTS: 3563 cases of tuberculosis in children were reported between 1999 and 2006. The incidence rate remained stable at around 4.3 per 100,000 (95% CI 4.1 to 4.4). Patients born outside the UK had a tuberculosis rate higher than children born in the UK (37 per 100,000 vs 2.5 per 100,000) and this rate increased over the period. Rates in the black African ethnic group were highest at 88 per 100,000. 60% of children had pulmonary disease, the commonest presentation, but only 948 (27%) had culture confirmed tuberculosis. The median time to diagnosis from onset of symptoms was 37 days (interquartile range 12-89). The proportions of cases with rifampicin, isoniazid and multi-drug resistant isolates were 2.4%, 9.3% and 2.3%, respectively. 88% of children completed treatment and less than 1% died. CONCLUSIONS: Overall rates of tuberculosis in children have remained stable, with the majority completing treatment. Rates are, however, highest in children not born in the UK, particularly among certain ethnic minority groups. Levels of drug resistance are also high.
