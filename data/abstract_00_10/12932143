Antifungal bioassay-guided isolation of the ethanol extract of the roots of Pentagonia gigantifolia yielded 6-octadecynoic acid (1) and the new 6-nonadecynoic acid (2). Compounds 1 and 2 inhibited the growth of fluconazole-susceptible and -resistant Candida albicans strains. Their antifungal potencies were comparable to those of amphotericin B and fluconazole. Of particular significance is the low cytotoxicity and specific activity of 1 and 2 against C. albicans.
