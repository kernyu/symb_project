CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of drug-resistant bacteria was lower than previous reports. In children with acute otitis media (AOM), lower age, presence of multiple bacteria, and otitis media with effusion (OME) represented significant factors for recurrent AOM and the presence of drug-resistant bacteria. OBJECTIVE: Recently, the proportion of drug-resistant bacteria has been increasing in children with AOM. We studied the proportion of drug-resistant bacteria and background factors for detection of drug-resistant bacteria and recurrent AOM in a private clinic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects comprised 170 patients <12 years old with AOM. Middle ear fluid was collected and pathogenic bacteria were identified. The following factors were considered: age, sex, use of antibiotics in the past 1 month, past history of recurrent AOM, presence of OME, and multiple bacteria of the three main strains (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis). RESULTS: A total of 169 strains were detected in 77% of children with AOM. Drug-resistant bacteria comprised 44 of the 169 strains (26%). Lower age (p=0.001) and presence of multiple bacteria (p<0.001) represented significant factors for the presence of drug-resistant bacteria. OME was a significant factor for recurrent AOM (p<0.001).
