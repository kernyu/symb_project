Forty Cryptococcus gattii strains were submitted to antifungal susceptibility testing with fluconazole, itraconazole, amphotericin B and terbinafine. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges were 0.5-64.0 for fluconazole, <0.015-0.25 for itraconazole, 0.015-0.5 for amphotericin B and 0.062-2.0 for terbinafine. A bioassay for the quantitation of fluconazole in murine brain tissue was developed. Swiss mice received daily injections of the antifungal, and their brains were withdrawn at different times over the 14-day study period. The drug concentrations varied from 12.98 to 44.60 mug/mL. This assay was used to evaluate the therapy with fluconazole in a model of infection caused by C. gattii. Swiss mice were infected intracranially and treated with fluconazole for 7, 10 or 14 days. The treatment reduced the fungal burden, but an increase in fungal growth was observed on day 14. The MIC for fluconazole against sequential isolates was 16 mug/mL, except for the isolates obtained from animals treated for 14 days (MIC = 64 mug/mL). The quantitation of cytokines revealed a predominance of IFN-gamma and IL-12 in the non-treated group and elevation of IL-4 and IL-10 in the treated group. Our data revealed the possibility of acquired resistance during the antifungal drug therapy.
