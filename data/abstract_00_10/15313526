The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program was initiated in 1997 as a global network for the longitudinal tracking of antimicrobial resistance and has incorporated a molecular typing protocol to detect and monitor emerging resistances in participant medical centers. Isolates with similar resistance profiles and patient demographics that were temporally related or those exhibiting emerging resistance phenotypes were routinely compared. Isolates were initially analyzed using the automated Riboprinter Microbial Characterization System (Qualicon, Inc., Wilmington, DE). Isolates with identical ribotype patterns were further characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. During 2001, a total of 647 bacterial isolates were processed using this typing protocol; 36% were Staphylococcus aureus with multidrug-resistant, mupirocin- or quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant phenotypes. Five ribotypes were predominant in this species with some occurring on more than one continent (184.5), whereas others were restricted to a single geographic region (893.2). Among S. aureus, 51 clusters demonstrating dissemination among patients were identified (31 medical centers). Twenty-three outbreaks/clusters were found among Enterobacteriaceae producing either extended-spectrum beta-lactamases or demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones. Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. strains were also analyzed, some of which produced metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes. Clusters of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter were identified in Argentina and Israel, whereas metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa epidemic strains were observed in Italy (three sites) and Brazil. The coupling of molecular epidemiologic investigations with global surveillance such as the SENTRY program adds significant value to participating medical centers and has proven to be effective in tracking changing trends and distribution of resistance genotypes both locally and globally.
