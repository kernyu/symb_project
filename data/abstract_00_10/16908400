Effective antimicrobials are critical in controlling one of the most common conditions encountered in medicine, namely, skin and skin structure infections. Unfortunately, the identification of appropriate and novel antimicrobials is continually challenged by the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria, fungi, and parasites. This work will focus on describing novel antibacterials and antifungals approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in the past 4 years.
