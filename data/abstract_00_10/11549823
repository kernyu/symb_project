In the present paper, several points regarding Helicobacter pylori treatment are reviewed, with the following conclusions: (1) all different proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are equivalent when prescribed with antibiotics; (2) ranitidine bismuth citrate is equal to or, in some cases with antibiotic resistance, more effective than PPI; (3) previous treatment with PPI does not seem to affect the rate of eradication obtained with PPI plus two antibiotics; (4) just 1 week of PPI is enough to obtain duodenal ulcer healing, provided that H. pylori eradication is achieved; (5) the eradication rates seem to be higher in peptic ulcer than in nonulcer dyspepsia; (6) in areas where the prevalence of metronidazole resistance is high, triple therapy including a PPI, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin is the best option, and (7) quadruple therapy (PPI, bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole) is the recommended second-line therapy after PPI-clarithromycin-amoxicillin failure, although replacing the PPI and the bismuth compound by ranitidine bismuth citrate achieves also good results.
