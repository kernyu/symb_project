We investigated the efficacy of 2 formulations of Augmentin on experimental pneumonia due to Haemophilus influenzae (HI) in rabbits. Two strains were used (H128 and 401285) with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid MICs of 1/0.5 mg/l and 4/2 mg/l. Pneumonia was induced in immunocompetent rabbits by inoculation of 10 log(10) CFU HI. The treatments were infused by using computer controlled pumps in order to mimic the human pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of either conventional Augmentin treatment (875/125 mg twice daily) or the sustained release formulation (SR: 2000/125 mg twice daily). After 2 d of treatment, the bacterial concentrations in the lungs were similar for both strains and both treatments: isolate H128, conventional Augmentin reduced bacterial numbers to 3.8+/-2.1 log(10) CFU/g and Augmentin SR to 3.1+/-2.4 log(10) CFU/g; isolate 401285, conventional Augmentin to 3.5+/-2. Thus, both treatments demonstrated similar efficacy against H. influenzae pneumonia in this model, even when induced by a strain with an amoxicillin/clavulanic acid MIC of 4/2 mg/l. These results support current breakpoints for conventional Augmentin against H. influenzae and suggest that Augmentin SR is at least as effective against these isolates.
