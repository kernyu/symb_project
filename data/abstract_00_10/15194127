The prevalence of mutations in the katG, inhA and oxyR-ahpC genes of isoniazid (INH)-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the Philippines were determined. Of 306 M. tuberculosis isolates studied, 81 (26.5%) exhibited INH-resistance. Forty-four strains (54.3%) had mutations in the katG gene, eighteen strains (22.2%) had mutations in the putative inhA locus region, seven had mutations in both regions and five strains had mutations in the oxyR-ahpC operon. Only seven strains had no mutations. A total of 71 of the 81 (87.6%) resistant strains and 65 of the 72 (90.3%) INH sensitive randomly selected strains showed amino acid substitution in codon 463 (Arg to Leu) (88.9%). This fact supports the hypothesis that mutations at codon 463 are independent of INH-resistance and are linked to the geographical origins of the strains.
