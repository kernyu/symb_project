In general, it is believed that fermentation by yeast under harsh industrial conditions, especially if substrates such as wood hydrolysate or lignocellulosic substrates are used, requires the use of so-called industrial strains. In order to check whether this is always true, a comparison of performance was made using two industrial strains and four commonly used laboratory strains, the haploid and diploid versions of CEN-PK and X2180, under industrially relevant stress conditions. The industrial strains were a Swedish commercial baker's yeast strain and a strain previously isolated from an industrial bioethanol production plant using lignocellulosic substrate. Stress conditions included, apart from growth in the lignocellulosic substrate itself, elevated concentrations of glucose, NaCl, ethanol, and lactate as well as low pH. Results showed that, indeed, the strain adapted to lignocellulosic substrate also possessed the highest growth rate as well as shortest duration of the lag phase in this type of medium. However, the higher the additional stress level, the lower the difference compared to other strains, and X2180 in particular displayed a high resistance to these additional stress conditions. Furthermore, no difference in performance could be detected between the haploid or diploid versions of the laboratory strains. It might be that, at least under some circumstances, a laboratory strain such as X2180 could be an industrially attractive production organism with the advantage of facilitating the possibilities for making controlled genetic manipulations.
