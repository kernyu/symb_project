Analysis of antibiotic resistant bacteria from composted waste site soil samples for two seasons were done, using prepared diagnostic test agar and direct sensitivity tests. All major isolated bacteria were subjected to various antibiotics. Concurrent positive and negative tests were simultaneously studied. Results show relatively high resistant and sensitive bacteria in both seasons. In wet seasons, the Bacillus cereus concentrations are considerably reduced than in the dry. In the dry seasons, Bacillus cereus was sensitive to Erythromycin (ERY) and Tetracycline (TET) and slightly resistant to Ampicillin (AMP), Chloramphenicol (CHL), Cloxacillin (CXC) and water (CNT). In the wet season, identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa was moderately resistant to Streptomycin (STR) and Tetracycline and remained resistant to Ampicillin, Cotrimoxazole (COT), Nitrofurantion (NIT) and water (CNT). The implications for human health are discussed.
