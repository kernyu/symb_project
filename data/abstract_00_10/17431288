BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are rapidly evolving group of beta-lactamase enzymes produced by the Gram negative bacteria. These enzymes have been derived from TEM and SHV genes by mutations and have been well described in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Information on molecular types of ESBL positive Klebsiella sp. is lacking from India. We therefore undertook this study to look for the TEM and SHV genes in ESBL positive Klebsiella sp. isolated from the patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in north India. METHODS: A total of 204 multidrug-resistant isolates of Klebsiellae obtained from clinical samples; blood (n=108), urine (n=15), pus (n=2) and sputum (n=79) were obtained and screened for resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins (3GC). The ESBL status was determined by double disk diffusion test (DDDT) and further by ESBL E-test. Multiplex PCR specific for TEM and SHV genes was performed to distinguish four different genotypes: TEM-positive, SHV-positive, TEM- and SHV-positive and non-TEM non-SHV ESBL types. RESULTS: Eighty six per cent (175 of 204) of the isolates were found to be resistant to at least one of the 3GCs, of which 97.1 per cent (170) of Klebsiella sp. isolates were confirmed to be positive for ESBL. Of these 170 isolates, 95 were randomly selected for PCR of TEM and SHV genes. Isolates having both TEM and SHV genes were common (67.3%) whereas only 20 per cent isolates possessed TEM gene and 8.4 per cent SHV gene alone. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the majority of the ESBL positive clinical isolates of Klebsiella sp. carried both TEM and SHV genes followed by TEM alone. Such studies need to be done in various geographical regions of the country to know about the prevalent genotypes for better management of infection.
