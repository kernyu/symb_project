Human immunodeficiency virus infection profoundly affects the medical community and is spreading rapidly in women of childbearing age worldwide. Transmission of HIV from mother to child can occur in utero, during labor, or after delivery through breast-feeding. Most of the infants are infected during delivery. We focus on the factors affecting the transmission of HIV, diagnostic and resistance tests, strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission with special reference to mode of delivery, infant feeding, and use of antiretroviral therapy. The risk of infection for the infant can be decreased by reducing maternal viral load, by elective cesarean delivery, and by avoidance of breast-feeding. The efficacy of antiretroviral treatment should be balanced against the possibility of embryonic or fetal toxicity. The choice of therapy should be based on the woman's treatment history, the clinical status, and the available prognostic markers, which are related to the progression of disease in the mother and the risk of mother-to-child transmission HIV transmission.
