Premafloxacin is a novel 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone with enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus. We found premafloxacin to be 32-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against wild-type S. aureus. Single mutations in either subunit of topoisomerase IV caused a four- to eightfold increase in the MICs of both quinolones. A double mutation (gyrA and either grlA or grlB) caused a 32-fold increase in the MIC of premafloxacin, while the MIC of ciprofloxacin increased 128-fold. Premafloxacin appeared to be a poor substrate for NorA, with NorA overexpression causing an increase of twofold or less in the MIC of premafloxacin in comparison to a fourfold increase in the MIC of ciprofloxacin. The frequency of selection of resistant mutants was 6.4 x 10(-10) to 4.0 x 10(-7) at twofold the MIC of premafloxacin, 2 to 4 log(10) less than that with ciprofloxacin. Single-step mutants could not be selected at higher concentrations of premafloxacin. In five single-step mutants, only one previously described uncommon mutation (Ala116Glu), and four novel mutations (Arg43Cys, Asp69Tyr, Ala176Thr, and Pro157Leu), three of which were outside the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) were found. Genetic linkage studies, in which incross of grlA(+) and outcross of mutations were performed, showed a high correlation between the mutations and the resistance phenotypes, and allelic exchange experiments confirmed the role of the novel mutations in grlA in resistance. Our results suggest that although topoisomerase IV is the primary target of premafloxacin, premafloxacin appears to interact with topoisomerase IV in a manner different from that of other quinolones and that the range of the QRDR of grlA should be expanded.
