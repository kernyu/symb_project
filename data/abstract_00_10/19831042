The antimicrobial activity of the n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of the aerial parts of C. drabifolia S.M. subsp. cappadocica (DC.) Wagenitz (Asteraceae) was evaluated against microorganisms including multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria using the paper disc diffusion method. The chemical composition of the chloroform extract of this plant was determined by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The chloroform extract exhibited significant antibacterial activity against all the bacteria tested, except Stenotrophomonas maltophilia MU63. The major compounds of the chloroform extract were spathulenol (14.1%), caryophyllene oxide (12.5%), octadecanol (10.2%), ethyl palmitate (7.7%), [Z,Z]-10,12-hexadecadienal (6.0%), 3-hydroxy p-anisaldehyde (5.9%) and pentacosane (5.8%).
