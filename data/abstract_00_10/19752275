In this work we report the characterization of plasmid pCTX-M360, isolated from a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain from China and encoding the CTX-M-3 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Sequence analysis of pCTX-M360 revealed extensive similarity with pEL60 and pCTX-M3, two other enterobacterial plasmids of the IncL/M incompatibility group. Compared to pEL60, pCTX-M360 contains several insertions but lacks most of a 27-kb insert found in pCTX-M3, suggesting that it could be an evolutionary intermediate between pEL60 and pCTX-M3.
