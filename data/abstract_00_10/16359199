Integrons in gentamicin- and cotrimoxazole-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from dogs and horses with clinical infections were analyzed by conserved segment PCR-RFLP. Five distinct integron types were found, most of which have previously been reported in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from humans and farm animals, indicating that resistance genes are exchanged between the reservoirs in humans, farm animals, and companion animals.
