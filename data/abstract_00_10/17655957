Current drug-susceptibility tests used routinely in clinical laboratories sometimes fail to identify strains of Staphylococcus aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. To solve this problem, we have developed a more sensitive and rapid method that measures bacterial metabolic activity by a chemiluminescence-based technique. This method is able to discriminate such strains from vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus with a sensitivity and specificity of > 95%. This rapid and reliable method appears to be promising for detection of vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus strains in clinical laboratories, and may supersede classical susceptibility testing.
