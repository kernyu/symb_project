The aim of the presented study was the analysis of microbiological data obtained from patients hospitalized in The Holly Cross Cancer Center in Kielce in 2001. The frequency of important nosocomial pathogens in selected specimens and their susceptibility to antibiotics were determined. The strains were identified by using commercial tests (bioMerieux) and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were performed by disc diffusion technique. The most prevalent bacteria were Gram-negative rods of Enterobacteriaceae family (43%), mainly Escherichia coli. Only 2.7% strains of isolated Escherichia coli isolated from clinical specimens collected from hospitalized patients were beta-lactamase--positive (ESBL+). The second important group of microorganisms were Staphylococci, followed by Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. About twenty eight percent of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to methicillin.
