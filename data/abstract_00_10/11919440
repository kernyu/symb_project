The in vitro antibacterial activity of sagamicin, gentamicin, tobramycin and norfloxacin was evaluated against 180 recent clinical isolates obtained from patients with ocular infections. Good activity was demonstrated for the 3 aminoglycosides against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. All 4 compounds showed a lower activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Sagamicin was highly effective against enterobacteriaceae with a MIC(90) of 2 mg/l and presented good antipseudomonal activity similar to that of gentamicin. Intraocular lenses impregnated with a sagamicin solution showed a good antistaphylococcal activity immediately after preparation. In our strain collection, the ability to produce slime was more frequent among methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis strains than methicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis (85 versus 70%). The attachment of 2 S. epidermidis strains to plastic surfaces was partially prevented by sagamicin subinhibitory concentrations. On the contrary, sub-MIC levels of norfloxacin increased the adhesion of S. epidermidis.
