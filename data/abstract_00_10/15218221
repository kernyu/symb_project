In this study, 34 clinical cerebrospinal fluid isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans were serotyped, and their in vitro susceptibilities to amphotericin B, fluconazole, and voriconazole were analyzed. Of these 34 isolates, serotype A was found in 29 isolates and serotype B in the other five. The voriconazole geometric mean MIC was significantly lower than the amphotericin B/antibiotic medium 3 geometric mean MIC (P < 0.0001 at both 48 and 72 h), as well as the fluconazole geometric mean MIC (P < 0.0001 at both 48 and 72 h). Of the three antifungal agents, only fluconazole, with geometric mean MICs at both 48 and 72 h, showed significant difference between the serotypes A and B of C. neoformans.
