OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and the antimicrobial resistance of the bacteria, mycoplasma and Chlamydia trachomatis isolated from the prostatic secretion of infertile men with chronic prostatitis, and to provide clinicians with grounds for choosing antibiotic agents. METHODS: The bacteria obtained were isolated and identified, the Chlamydia trachomatis was detected by FLO-PCR, and the results were analysed statistically. RESULTS: In 1 186 specimens of EPS, the total positive rate of isolates was 51.7%. Among them, there were 364 strains of gram-positive coccus, 20 gram-negative bacillus, 5 other strains and 157 mycoplasma, including 116 Ureaplasma urealyticum and 41 Mycoplasma hominis, and 67 Chlamydia trachomatis DNA. As for the isolated staphylococci, their antimicrobial resistance was the lowest against vancomycin (0.0%), but the highest against penicillins (76.9%-100%); for the Streptococcus agalactiae, it was the highest against erythromycin and clindamycin (100%), and the lowest against beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole, rifampin and vancomycin (0.0%); for the Ureaplasma urealyticum, it was the highest against ciprofloxacin (59.5%), and the lowest against josamycin, tetracycline and fosfomycin (1.7%); for the Mycoplasma hominis, it was the highest against erythromycin (100%), and the lowest against doxycycline and fosfomycin (0.0%). CONCLUSION: Bacteria, mycoplasma and Chlamydia trachomatis are the possible etiological factors of male infertility. Isolated bacterial strains differ greatly in their resistance against different antibiotics.
