Insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) is a member of the insulin gene family with known neurotrophic properties. The actions of IGF2 are mediated via the IGF type 1 and type 2 receptors as well as through the insulin receptors, all of which are widely expressed throughout the brain. Since IGF2 is up-regulated in the brain after injury, we wanted to determine whether the absence of IGF2 can lead to any alteration on brain morphology and/or in the response of its receptor binding sites following a neurotoxic insult. No morphological differences were observed between the brains of IGF2 knockout (IGF2(-/-)) and wild-type control (IGF2(+/+)) mice. However, our in vitro receptor autoradiography results indicate that IGF2(-/-) mice had lower endogenous levels of [(125)I]IGF1 and [(125)I]insulin receptor binding sites in the hippocampus and cerebellum as compared to IGF2(+/+) mice, while endogenous [(125)I]IGF2 receptor binding showed a decrease only in the cerebellum. Seven days after kainic acid administration, the [(125)I]insulin receptor binding sites were significantly decreased in all brain regions of the IGF2(+/+) mice, while the levels of [(125)I]IGF1 and [(125)I]IGF2 binding sites were decreased only in select brain areas. The IGF2(-/-) mice, on the other hand, showed increased [(125)I]IGF1 and [(125)I]IGF2 and [(125)I]insulin receptor binding sites in selected regions such as the hippocampus and cerebellum. These results, taken together, suggest that deletion of IGF2 gene does not affect gross morphology of the brain but does selectively alter endogenous [(125)I]IGF1, [(125)I]IGF2 and [(125)I]insulin receptor binding sites and their response to neurotoxicity.
