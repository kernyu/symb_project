The escalation in drug resistance is well documented for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the urgency to discover new antibiotic treatments is more apparent with the growing incidences of vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant S aureus. Much of the current research into finding new remedies focuses on chemical modification of existing antibiotics (ie, glycopeptides and cephalosporins) and developing synthetic molecules with novel mechanisms of action (ie, oxazolidinones and N-thiolated b-lactams). This review describes recent progress toward the clinical development of new drug therapies for MRSA.
