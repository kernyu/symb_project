Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) harbors an antibiotic resistance gene cluster and was previously identified in the multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium DT104, Agona, Paratyphi B, and Albany. This antibiotic resistance gene cluster is a complex class 1 integron and most often confers resistance to ampicillin (Ap), chloramphenicol (Cm)/florfenicol (Ff), streptomycin (Sm)/spectinomycin (Sp), sulfonamides (Su), and tetracycline (Tc) (ApCmFfSmSpSuTc profile). Recently, variant SGI1 antibiotic resistance gene clusters conferring different antibiotic resistance profiles have been identified in several S. enterica serovars and were classified as SGI1-A to -G. We identified a new variant SGI1 antibiotic resistance gene cluster in two multidrug-resistant S. enterica serovar Newport strains isolated from humans in France. In these strains, the Sm/Sp resistance gene cassette aadA2 inserted at the first attI1 site was replaced by two other aminoglycoside resistance gene cassettes. The first one contains a new resistance gene encoding an AAC(3)-I aminoglycoside 3-N-acetyltransferase that confers resistance to gentamicin (Gm) and sisomicin (Sc). This gene has been named aac(3)-Id. The second one harbors the Sm/Sp resistance gene aadA7. This gene cassette replacement in the SGI1 complex integron of serovar Newport strains constitutes a new variant SGI1 antibiotic resistance gene cluster named SGI1-H. The occurrence of SGI1 in different S. enterica serovars, now including serovar Newport, strengthens the hypothesis of horizontal transfer of SGI1.
