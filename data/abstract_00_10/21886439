In Canada, antimicrobial treatment is the most common approach for acute otitis media. The aim of the present study was to compare the cost effectiveness of treatment with amoxicillin versus a watch-and-wait approach (WAIT) within a Canadian pediatric setting. Four hundred eighty-eight children, six months to five years of age, who participated in a randomized controlled trial were included in the study. The average medication costs per patient were higher for the amoxicillin group ($17.26) than for the WAIT group ($4.33). However, both health care ($148.44 versus $162.48) and patient costs ($23.50 versus $31.87) were greater for the WAIT group. The mean cost of treatment for the amoxicillin group was $189.20, compared with $198.68 for the WAIT group. Amoxicillin may be cost effective in treating children with acute otitis media. The potential development of antimicrobial resistance was not addressed in the present study.
