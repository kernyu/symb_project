Daptomycin monotherapy was superior to ceftriaxone monotherapy and was highly efficacious in experimental pneumococcal meningitis, sterilizing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of three of three rabbits after 4 to 6 h. With daptomycin therapy only a negligible release of [(3)H]choline as marker of cell wall lysis was detectable in the CSF, peaking around 250 cpm/min after 4 h, compared to a peak of around 2,400 cpm/min after 4 to 6 h for the ceftriaxone-treated rabbits.
