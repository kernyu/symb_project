OBJECTIVE: To identify the best indicative bacteriophage in disinfection tests through comparing the resistance of bacteriophage T4, phiX174D, and f2 to glutaraldehyde. METHODS: The virucidal activities of glutaraldehyde against bacteriophage T4, phiX174D, and f2 were assessed with suspension tests along with neutralizer tests. The double-agar-layer plaque technique was used to detect the bacteriophage T4, phiX174D, and f2. RESULTS: (1)In a condition of 3000 mg/L of glutaraldehyde and 20 minutes of contact or 6000 mg/L of glutaraldehyde and 5 minutes of contact, "disinfection" level for bacteriophage T4 was achieved, with the log10 inactivation value (LIV) or log10o reduction value (LRV) (=log10No-log10Nt) > or = 4. 00 log10. (2) In a condition of 2500 mg/L of glutaraldehyde and 20 minutes of contact or 5000 mg/L of glutaraldehyde and 5 minutes of contact, the LIV for bacteriophage phiX174D reached "disinfection" level; (3) In a condition of 4000 mg/L of glutaraldehyde and 40 minutes of contact or 8000 mg/L of glutaraldehyde and 10 minutes of contact, the LIV for bacteriophage f2 reached "disinfection" level. CONCLUSION: Bacteriophage f2 and bacteriophage phiX174D has the strongest and weakest resistance to glutaraldehyde respectively.
