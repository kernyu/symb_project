OBJECTIVE: To investigate antifungal activity of silver nitrate compared with fluconazole, ketoconazole and amphotericin B against ocular pathogenic fungi in vitro. METHODS: It was an experimental study. Susceptibility tests were performed against 260 isolates (15 genera and 29 species) of ocular pathogenic fungi by broth dilution antifungal susceptibility testing of filamentous fungi (M38-A) approved by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Final concentrations ranged from 0.031 to 16.000 mg/L for silver nitrate, ketoconazole and amphotericin B, from 0.5 - 256.0 mg/L for fluconazole. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest drug concentration that showed absence of growth or complete growth inhibition (100%). The end points were determined as 100% growth inhibition for silver nitrate and amphotericin B, and > or = 75% growth inhibition for ketoconazole and fluconazole. RESULTS: The MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)) of silver nitrate, ketoconazole, amphotericin B and fluconazole were 2.000, 512.000, 32.000 and 2.000 mg/L for Fusarium species, respectively; 1.000, 256.000, 2.000 and 2.000 mg/L for Aspergillus species, respectively; 2.000, 128.000, 4.000 and 2.000 mg/L for Alternaria alternate, respectively; 2.000, 4.000, 0.125 and 0.500 mg/L for Curvularia lunata, respectively; and 1.000, 256.000, 1.000 and 1.000 mg/L for unusual ocular pathogens, respectively. Silver nitrate was highly active against Aspergillus species (92.9% susceptible at a MIC of < or = 1.0 mg/L) and Fusarium species (96.3% susceptible at a MIC of < or = 2.0 mg/L). 95.6% of Fusarium species and 90.8% of Aspergillus species exhibited resistance to fluconazole, 44.1% of Fusarium species and 42.9% of Aspergillus species exhibited resistance to amphotericin B, 66.2% of Fusarium species exhibited resistance to ketoconazole. The activity of silver nitrate against the fluconazole-resistant, ketoconazole-resistant and amphotericin B-resistant strains was high. CONCLUSION: Silver nitrate has promising activity against a wide variety of ocular pathogenic fungi in vitro, and may have a role in future studies of antifungal eye drops and treating fungal keratitis.
