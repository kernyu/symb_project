Antimalarial agents structurally based on novel pharmacophores, synthesized by low-cost synthetic procedures and characterized by low potential for developing resistance are urgently needed. Recently, we developed an innovative class of antimalarials based on a polyaromatic pharmacophore. Hybridizing the 4-aminoquinoline or the 9-aminoacridine system of known antimalarials with the clotrimazole-like pharmacophore, characterized by a polyarylmethyl group, we describe herein the development of a unique class (4a-l and 5a-c) of antimalarials selectively interacting with free heme and interfering with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) heme metabolism. Combination of the polyarylmethyl system, able to form and stabilize radical intermediates, with the iron-complexing and conjugation-mediated electron transfer properties of the 4(9)-aminoquinoline(acridine) system led to potent antimalarials in vitro against chloroquine sensitive and resistant Pf strains. Among the compounds synthesized, 4g was active in vivo against P. chabaudi and P. berghei after oral administration and, possessing promising pharmacokinetic properties, it is a candidate for further preclinical development.
