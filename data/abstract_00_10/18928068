In developing countries, as well as in many western countries, members of the genus Campylobacter are recognized as one of the most common cause of acute bacterial enteritis. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolation rates have been shown to be equal to, and sometimes higher than those of other enteric pathogens. The Microbiology Laboratory of the local Public Health Authority in Prahova County conducted a one and a half-year laboratory-based survey of Campylobacter infections in patients suffering from gastrointestinal symptoms. From a total of 3284 stool samples screened, the culture-positive ones confirmed the bacterial etiology for 551 diarrhea cases. Campylobacter was found in 345 specimens, being the most frequently isolated enteropathogen. C. jejuni outnumbered C. coli species (239 vs. 106 isolates). Salmonella isolates were the second local cause of diarrhea. The highest isolation rate of Campylobacter was found in children 5 years of age (262 strains). The prevalence of campylobacteriosis declined with age. The isolation rate of Campylobacter (10.5%), the unimodal age-specific distribution of cases, as well as the identification of polymicrobial infections among the screened population were epidemiological aspects resembling reports on campylobacteriosis in developing countries. The susceptibility of Campylobacter isolates to various antimicrobial agents, including macrolides and fluoroquinolones was also assessed. Among the screened isolates, Erythromycin retained a good activity, while an increased ciprofloxacin resistance was observed. The information gathered through this local study sustains the importance of Campylobacter in the etiology of autochthonous infectious diarrhea. A development of a national surveillance program regarding the most important foodborne pathogens would be beneficial for improving prevention and controlling measures.
