The proton motive force-driven efflux pump LmrP confers multidrug resistance on Lactococcus lactis cells by extruding a wide variety of lipophilic cationic compounds from the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane to the exterior of the cell. LmrP contains one cysteine (Cys(270)), which was replaced by alanine. This cysteine-less variant was used in a cysteine scanning accessibility approach. All 19 acidic residues in LmrP were replaced one by one by cysteine and subsequently challenged with the large thiol reagent fluorescein maleimide. The labeling pattern strongly indicates that only three acidic residues (Asp(142), Glu(327), and Glu(388)) are membrane-embedded. The roles of these residues in drug recognition were evaluated based on transport experiments with two cationic substrates, ethidium and Hoechst 33342, after replacing each of these residues with cysteine, alanine, lysine, glutamate, or aspartate. The obtained results suggest that the negative charges at positions 142 and 327 are not critical for the transport function but are important for drug recognition by LmrP. Surprisingly, the residues Cys(142) and Cys(327) become accessible for fluorescein maleimide upon binding of substrates, indicating a movement of these residues from a nonpolar to a polar environment. Substrate binding apparently results in a conformational change in this region of the protein and a reorientation of a lipid-embedded, hydrophobic substrate-binding site to an aqueous substrate translocation pathway.
