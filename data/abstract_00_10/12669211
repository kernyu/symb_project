Immunocompromised patients are developing in an increasing frequency acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex infections. Different treatment options need to be evaluated considering the possible side effects in regard to the patients' immunocompromised status. A 73-year-old woman with B-cell lymphatic leukemia with a secondary antibody deficiency syndrome and anemia suffered for one year with perianal ulcerations caused by acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex infection Type II. Based on previous reports about successful treatment of acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex infections with foscarnet, cidofovir or vidarabine and considering the different side effects of these drugs as well as the underlying diseases of the patient, we treated her with foscarnet intravenously. After 3 months the ulcers showed a nearly complete remission.
