OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical and laboratory findings of Streptococcus pneumoniae acute otitis media in children during a 1 year period. METHODS: From October 1995 to September 1996, 113 children aged 2 months to 14 years (median 18 months), with S. pneumoniae acute otitis media were studied. Susceptibility testing was performed by the Kirby-Bauer method and the E-test, and serotyping by the Quellung reaction. RESULTS: E-test assays detected five isolates (4.4%) to be highly resistant to penicillin and 13 (11.5%) that had intermediate resistance. All isolates were found to be susceptible to vancomycin, rifampicin and cefotaxime. In total, 25 isolates (22.1%) were resistant to one or more drugs. Fifty per cent of the penicillin-resistant or intermediately resistant S. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to multiple drugs, whereas only 2.1% of the penicillin-susceptible isolates were resistant to multiple drugs. The predominating serogroups of the isolates with reduced susceptibility to penicillin were the 19 (61.1%), 9 (16.7%), 23 (11.1%), 6 (5.5%) and 14 (5.5%) whereas those of the susceptible isolates were the 19 (26.3%), 14 (13.7%), 3 (11.6%), 6 (11.6%), 9 (8.4%), 1 (5.3%) and 12 (5.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from children with acute otitis media were penicillin-insensitive in 15.9%. The multiresistant S. pneumoniae isolates belonged to serogroups: 19 (45.4%), 9 (27.3%), 6 (18.2%) and 23 (9.1%).
