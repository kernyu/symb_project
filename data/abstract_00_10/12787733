The aim of our investigation was to improve the effectiveness of DNA vaccines against herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. We chose coimmunization with DNA encoding cytokines known to emphasize components of immune defense that best correlate with immune protection. These include interferon-producing T and NK cells and the IgG2a isotype immunoglobulin. Our results show that the coadministration of plasmid DNA encoding IL-12 or IL-18 along with glycoprotein B (gB) DNA improves immune induction. Recipients of the coimmunization procedure had elevated humoral as well as IFN-gamma-producing T cell responses and showed greater resistance to vaginal challenge with a lethal dose of HSV-1. The adjuvant effects were observed when the vaccines were administered either systemically or mucosally. By most assays, the adjuvant effect of IL-18 was superior to IL-12, although gB DNA plus IL-18 failed to induce levels of immunity achieved by UV-inactivated HSV immunization. Mucosal immunization proved as an effective means of inducing systemic immunity, but was less effective than the systemic route for inducing protection from vaginal challenge. Our results also demonstrated that protection from such challenges was mainly a property of IFN-gamma. Thus, immunized IFN-gamma-/- mice remained susceptible to challenges even while generating readily measurable immune responses. The approach of using DNA vaccines combined with DNA encoding cytokines holds promise and represents a potentially useful approach for vaccines.
