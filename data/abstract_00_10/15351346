Several new nucleoside analogs are currently in development for the treatment of HIV-1 infections. Alovudine, amdoxovir, elvucitabine, Racivir, Reverset and SPD 754 are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors that were designed and selected in anticipation of having improved resistance, safety, compatibility and efficacy profiles. Clinical trials are demonstrating that some of these goals are being met, and that nucleoside analogs as a class of compounds remain fertile ground for finding valuable additions to current anti-retrovirus treatment regimens.
