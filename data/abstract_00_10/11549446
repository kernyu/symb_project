Sulfonamide derivatives of chloroquine and primaquine were synthesised and evaluated against both paclitaxel-sensitive and paclitaxel-resistant mammarian cancer cell lines. All derivatives exhibited at least 96% MDR reversal activity when co-administered with paclitaxel at 5 microM. The best compound, a chloroquine derivative, exhibited 99% MDR reversal activity when co-administered with paclitaxel at 1 microM. Molecular modelling studies reveal that these derivatives share a common pharmacophore with taxane MDR reversal agents.
