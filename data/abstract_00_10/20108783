OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research is to construct a clinic-usable genechip method for detection of hepatitis B virus lamivudine-resistant mutants and basal core promotor/Pre-C mutants, compare this method with DNA sequencing to investigate this genechip's character (sensity, specificity, stability and practicability in clinic) and apply it in clinic. METHODS: This genechip detection method can detect the DNA and 8 mutative site of HBV, include 3 lamivudine-resistant mutation site(No. 180, 204, 207 site in DNA polymerase gene), 5 HBeAg escape-related mutation site (nt 1896, 1899, 1862, 1764,1762 site in BCP/Pre-C region).The results of genechip method was verified by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: In detecting HBV DNA, the results of genechip were agree with 100% of the results of DNA sequencing. In detecting HBV mutants, 251 sites (in 32 samples, 256 sites) showed the same results using both methods, and only 5 sites were not completely match (P > 0.05). In these 5 sites, genechip methods got multi-infection results, but sequencing got single-infection results. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that genechip method has the same positive rate and almost these same specificity with DNA sequencing method, and is better than DNA sequencing method in detecting multi-infected HBV strains.
