Bacillus cereus is known as a serious bacterial pathogen in neutropenic patients. B. cereus is often resistant to beta-lactams, including penicillins and cephalosporins. We report a case of fatal pneumonia caused by B. cereus in a patient with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) during remission induction therapy. Cefepime was started for febrile neutropenia (FN) initially and was switched to panipem/betamipron, when fulminant pneumonia supervened. The isolated strain was resistant not only to cefepime but also to panipenem/betamipron. This is the first report of fulminant infection caused by carbapenem-resistant B. cereus in a neutropenic patient. B. cereus should be kept in mind as a target of empirical treatment when neutropenic patients develop pneumonia.
