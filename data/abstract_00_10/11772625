Salmonella enterica serotype Bredeney has emerged as the third most commonly identified serotype among human clinical isolates referred to the Irish National Salmonella Reference Laboratory in the years 1998 to 2000. A collection of 112 isolates of S. enterica serotype Bredeney collected during the period 1995 to 1999 from animal, food, and human sources from both Ireland and Northern Ireland were studied. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF) were performed on all isolates. Plasmid profiles were examined on a subset of 33 isolates. A high proportion (74%) of isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested. Resistance to both sulfonamide and trimethoprim was observed in 21% of isolates, and resistance to multiple (five) antimicrobial agents was observed in a single isolate (0.9%). Eight different PFGE patterns were obtained, with 87% of isolates grouping as PFGE type A. PFGE type A was predominant in animals, food, and humans. There was good overall concordance between the groups identified by PFGE and DAF. Overall results indicate that most S. enterica serotype Bredeney isolates in Ireland and Northern Ireland from animal and human sources are clonally related.
