Between August 1995 and December 1999, sixty patients with chronic osteomyelitis had the effluent from the discharging sinuses and bone biopsies cultured aerobically and anaerobically. 47 positive isolates were obtained and the organism commonly isolated both in the single- and two-organism isolates was Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity patterns of these isolates were carried out with the available antibiotic discs. 30 per cent of the organisms isolated were sensitive to ceftriaxone (Rocephine) and gentamycin.
