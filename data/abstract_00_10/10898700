A micellar formulation of amphotericin B (AmB) solubilized with poloxamer 188 was evaluated against an AmB Leishmania donovani-resistant line. A concave isobologram showed a synergistic effect of this association against promastigotes. This result was confirmed with amastigotes since the 50% effective concentration of the new formulation was 100 times less than that of the control AmB formulation.
