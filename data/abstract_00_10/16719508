Fifty lactobacilli isolated from black table olive brines were evaluated for their salt tolerance, resistance to oleuropein and verbascoside, and ability to grow in modified filter-sterilized brines. A strain of Lactobacillus pentosus was selected and used as a starter to ferment, in pilot plant, black olives (Itrana and Leccino cv.) in brines modified for pH, carbohydrate, and growth factor concentrations, at 28 degrees C. The temperature-controlled fermentation of Leccino cv. olives resulted in obtaining ready-to-eat, high-quality table olives in a reduced-time process. HPLC analysis of phenolic compounds from fermented olives showed a decrease of oleuropein, a glucoside secoiridoid responsible for the bitter taste of olive drupes, and an increase of the hydroxytyrosol concentration. The selected strain of L. pentosus (1MO) allowed the reduction of the debittering phase period to 8 days.
