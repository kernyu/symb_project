Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a global bacterial scourge that has become resistant to many classes of antibiotics, and treatment options for MRSA infections are limited. The cause of MRSA resistance to all commercially available beta-lactam antibiotics is the acquisition of the gene mecA, which encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP 2a). PBP 2a is a transpeptidase, which in contrast to the other transpeptidases of S. aureus does not experience inhibition by beta-lactam antibiotics. The lack of inhibition is due to a closed conformation for the active site for PBP 2a, which opens up only in the course of the catalytic function of the protein. Here we show that two new anti-MRSA antibiotics now undergoing clinical trials, ceftaroline and ME1036, are able to inhibit PBP 2a effectively, a process that is enhanced in the presence of a cell wall structural surrogate. It is likely that in the course of bacterial growth the occupancy of the allosteric site for the cell wall is co-opted by these antibiotics, and under these conditions the second-order rate constant for the encounter of the antibiotic and PBP 2a approaches the clinically useful value of 10(4)-10(5) M-1 s-1. These compounds are potent inhibitors of PBP 2a as well as PBPs from other species, and have potential as therapeutic agents for treatment of serious infections by MRSA and other resistant bacterial pathogens.
