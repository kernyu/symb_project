Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response resulting from local infection due, at least in part, to impaired neutrophil migration. IL-12 and IL-18 play an important role in neutrophil migration. We have investigated the mechanism and relative role of IL-12 and IL-18 in polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice. Wild-type (WT) and IL-18(-/-) mice were resistant to sublethal CLP (SL-CLP) sepsis. In contrast, IL-12(-/-) mice were susceptible to SL-CLP sepsis with high bacteria load in peritoneal cavity and systemic inflammation (serum TNF-alpha and lung neutrophil infiltration). The magnitude of these events was similar to those observed in WT mice with lethal CLP sepsis. The inability of IL-12(-/-) mice to restrict the infection was not due to impairment of neutrophil migration, but correlated with decrease of phagocytosis, NO production, and microbicidal activities of their neutrophils, and with reduction of systemic IFN-gamma synthesis. Consistent with this observation, IFN-gamma(-/-) mice were as susceptible to SL-CLP as IL-12(-/-) mice. Moreover, addition of IFN-gamma to cultures of neutrophils from IL-12(-/-) mice restored their phagocytic, microbicidal activities and NO production. Mortality of IL-12(-/-) mice to SL-CLP was prevented by treatment with IFN-gamma. Thus we show that IL-12, but not IL-18, is critical to an efficient host defense in polymicrobial sepsis. IL-12 acts through induction of IFN-gamma and stimulation of phagocytic and microbicidal activities of neutrophils, rather than neutrophil migration per se. Our data therefore provide further insight into the defense mechanism against this critical area of infectious disease.
