Eighty group G streptococcal stains were collected from Chinese children. Susceptibility testing was done by a double-dilution and a disk diffusion method. PCR was used to test drug-resistant genes, and the chi(2) test and definite probability methods were used to test for statistically significant differences among the three groups. Thirty-four isolates (42.5%) showed resistance to erythromycin. There are differences between the resistance characteristics of group G streptococci from different regions of China.
