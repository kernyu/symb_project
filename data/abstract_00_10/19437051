The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the presence of a nasogastric tube (NGT) for feeding has an impact on the nasal colonization by Staphylococcus aureus. Three groups of frail elderly were examined: 76 patients fed by NGTs and 52 orally fed patients in skilled nursing wards, and 33 orally fed patients in regular nursing wards. Samples from the nasal and oral cavities were cultured for S. aureus and susceptibility testing for oxacillin was performed. The prevalence of S. aureus (either oxacillin-susceptible or oxacillin-resistant) in the NGT-fed group was not significantly different to that in the two orally fed groups nor the nostril in which the NGT was placed. A significant correlation in colonization was found between the two nares and between the nares and oral cavity in the same patient (r > 0.45, P < 0.005) for both oxacillin-susceptible and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. The presence of NGTs for feeding in elderly frail patients is not associated with higher rates of S. aureus colonization in the nares or oral cavity.
