BACKGROUND: Infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens are a serious infection control problem with considerable public-health relevance. Regional networks coordinated by local public health departments are to be originated to establish a broader implementation of currently available official guidelines on infection prevention and control which consider the nosocomial transmission of MRSA. This is also due to the raise of awareness for the need of infection control implications to fight other multidrug-resistant pathogens. METHOD: A standardised guidance and survey in Bavarian hospitals on the basis of a checklist concerning structure, process and outcome quality parameters was done by the local public health departments. The data analysis was carried out by the Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority. OUTCOMES: Checklists from 130 hospitals spread on 92% of the local districts of Bavaria were analysed. The results point out the need for improvements considering working time and duties of infection control professionals, especially infection control nurses, screening concepts and the compliance with legal regulations on the surveillance of nosocomial infections. On the other hand, the available guidelines for the management of patients carrying MRSA seem to be held serious.
