The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) nevirapine (NVP) has been used as a component of salvage therapy for patients who have experienced virologic failure while taking nucleosides and protease inhibitors (PIs). In spite of broad cross-resistance within the NNRTI class, NVP may also play a role in salvage therapy for patients who have experienced failure while taking NNRTIs Another role for NVP in treatment-experienced patients is in so-called "PI switch" strategies, in which NVP is substituted for a PI within a virologically successful combination regimen. This paper reviews the clinical data that support the use of NVP in salvage regimens and PI switch strategies.
