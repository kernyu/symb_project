OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of Helicobacter pylori eradication in patients with functional and organic dyspepsia. METHODS: The study included a cohort of 160 patients (115 with organic and 45 with functional dyspepsia) with dyspeptic symptoms and gastroscopically confirmed H. pylori infection. Triple therapy with omeprazole 20 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg and metronidazole 400 mg (OAM) was administered twice a day for a week. Minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) was estimated on cultures from 41 patients with positive H. pylori for determination of antimicrobial sensitivity and primary resistance to amoxicillin and metronidazole. RESULTS: Endoscopic examination at least 6 weeks after therapy showed that 116 (72.5%) patients had H. pylori eradicated, whereas 44 (27.5%) were not. From the latter patients, 10 (23%) had functional dyspepsia and from 116 eradicated patients 35 (30%) had functional dyspepsia. Difference in efficacy of OAM therapy between patients with organic and functional dyspepsia was not significant (P > 0.5). Percentages of non-eradicated patients with organic and functional dyspepsia were 29.6 and 22.2%, respectively (ratio 1.3 : 1). MIC from 41 samples showed 18 (44%) in vitro resistant strains. There was no resistance to amoxicillin. CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference in H. pylori resistance to the same antibiotic between patients having functional or organic dyspepsia.
