Problems with resistance to antifungal drugs have emerged due to an increase in the incidence of systemic fungal infections and widespread use of antifungal agents. Accordingly, efforts have been made to develop adequate fungal susceptibility tests. The ideal test should have high intra and inter-laboratory reproducibility, good correlation with the clinical outcome, and should be easy to perform. While no such test has yet been developed, advances have been made. Over the past decade, many reports of fungal resistance have been published, most of them in AIDS patients. Though the frequency of resistant strains is still low in neutropenic cancer patients, and is mostly limited to Candida glabrata and Candida krusei, resistance to Candida albicans has also been reported.
