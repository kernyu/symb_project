Results of microbiological investigation of catarrhal gingivitis on the background of treatment with Unimag are presented in the work. Preparation Unimag is a stable suspension of magnetic nano-particles. Unimag is magnetic-sensitive, X-ray contrast, bactericidal substance; it increases functional activity of phagocytes and characterizes with high penetration ability in tissues. Studies have revealed that treatment with Unimag of the patients with catarrhal and gingivitis rapidly normalizes quantity of microbes in the oral cavity, substituting the gram-negative pathogenic flora for the gram-positive microorganisms in the oral cavity. Unimag increases sensitivity of pathogenic flora towards the anti-bacterial preparations. All the above-mentioned are significant for efficient impact on damaging factors during inflammation.
