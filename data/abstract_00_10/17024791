Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing measures the lowest drug concentration that prevents microbial growth using an inoculum of 10(5) colony forming units/ml (cfu/ml) whereas the mutant prevention concentration (MPC) (inoculum approximately 10(10) cells) defines the antimicrobial drug concentration threshold that would require an organism to possess two simultaneous mutations for continued growth in the presence of the drug. The rates at which multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [MDRSP] were killed by the respiratory fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin, gemfloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, were compared based on the MIC and MPC drug concentrations and at inocula ranging from 10(6)-10(9) cfu/ml. The MIC drug concentration failed to eradicate all viable cells whereas the MPC drug concentration resulted in 99.9% to 100% cellular reduction following 12-24 hours of drug exposure. MPC values against S. pneumoniae were different for each fluoroquinolone. The MPC drug concentration prevents the selection of multidrug-resistant or fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae. The value of dosing of antimicrobial agents based on MPC thresholds results in a rapid reduction in viable cells--even at higher inocula which are more reflective of organism burden in pneumonia. The rapid reduction in viable cells observed at MPC drug concentrations may not only have an impact on preventing the selection of resistant mutants but may also help explain the rapid symptom resolution seen with new fluoroquinolones since these agents lead to little or low release of cell contents which are known to drive the inflammatory response.
