We report a case of Candida glabrata invasive candidiasis that developed reduced susceptibility to caspofungin during prolonged therapy. Pre- and posttreatment isolates were confirmed to be isogenic, and sequencing of hot spots known to confer echinocandin resistance revealed an F659V substitution within the FKS2 region of the glucan synthase complex.
