The genotype and antibiotic resistance pattern of the toxigenic Vibrio cholerae strains associated with cholera outbreaks vary frequently. Fifty-one V. cholerae strains isolated from cholera outbreaks in Chennai (2002-2005) were screened for the presence of virulence and regulatory genes by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Genotyping of the isolates was done by VC1 primers derived from enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-related sequence in V. cholerae. All the isolates possessed toxigenic genes, such as ctxA, ctxB, tcpA, ace, ompU, toxR and zot. Two different El Tor genotypes and one O139 genotype could be delineated by VC1-PCR. One of the El Tor genotypes was similar to the El Tor strains isolated from Bhind district and Delhi during 2004. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed greater variability among the isolates tested. All the isolates were found to be susceptible to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline. Thiry-three per cent of the isolates were found to be resistant to more than 4 antibiotics and could be termed as multiple antibiotic resistant. Coexistence of O139 serogroup along with the El Tor biotype could be identified among the strains recovered during the period 2002-2004. The O139 isolates were found to be more susceptible to the antibiotics tested when compared to the El Tor isolates.
