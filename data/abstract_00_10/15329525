Gram-positive cocci are becoming more and more common agents of nasocomial infections, primarily enterococci and staphylococci in the field of surgical site and bloodstream infection. At the same time, the frequency of multiresistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci has increased, whereas glycopeptide-resistant enterococcal strains and, recently, staphylococci with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides have appeared, so making the use of glycopeptides as the "last-chance drugs" ineffective. Under those circumstances, the synthesis of new potent antibiotics, such as oxazolidinones, is both desirable and welcome. Linezolid possesses a high activity against all multiresistant gram-positive cocci, favourable pharmacokinetics, a good safety profile, a complete bioavailability after and administration permitting switch therapy, a low capacity of inducing resistance, and both clinical and microbiologic efficacy as demonstrated by a number of clinical trials conducted on thousands of patients. So, linezolid is an important therapeutic option in the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant enterococcal and staphylococcal strains.
