OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Staphylococci isolated from naturally occurring canine ocular diseases. SAMPLES AND PROCEDURES: Samples obtained from 68 dogs with signs of external eye disease were processed for isolation of bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus sp. Isolates were identified by biochemical reactions and tested for susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials of six classes. RESULTS: Forty (58.8%) samples yielded Staphylococcus sp. in pure culture. Coagulase-positive Staphylococci were most common and Staphylococcus intermedius was the most frequent (45%) species, followed by S. aureus (22.5%) and the coagulase-negative species S. epidermidis (20%), and S. simulans (12.5%). Resistance to at least one drug was observed in 92.5% of the isolates, and multidrug resistance was a common finding (72.5%). The most effective drugs against Staphylococcus strains isolated from extra-ocular canine ocular diseases were ceftiofur and cefalexin. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the presence of Staphylococcus sp. genus in naturally occurring extra-ocular canine ocular disease and the emergence of resistant strains to common antimicrobial drugs. It also emphasizes the need for bacterial culture with species identification and susceptibility testing in order to choose the appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
