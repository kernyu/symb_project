Antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem worldwide that is exacerbated by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Patients, pharmaceutical marketing, and the use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and animal husbandry are important factors to consider in the emergence of resistance. Infection control measures to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are compromised by poor compliance to basic measures such as handwashing and standards of environmental cleanliness. Wider epidemiological factors such as global travel and complacency towards public health must also be considered. This article aims to improve understanding of antibiotic resistance and suggests ways in which nurses can contribute towards the strategy to address the problem.
