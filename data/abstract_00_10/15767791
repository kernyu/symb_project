Mx is an interferon (IFN)-induced protein that shows antiviral activities against RNA viruses. We examined an expression of mRNA, an intracellular localization of protein, and an antiviral property of canine Mx1 and Mx2. Both Mx1 and Mx2 mRNAs were induced in a canine kidney cell line Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), stimulated with an IFN-inducer, poly(I) x poly(C) for 12 h, suggesting the presence of regulatory mechanisms consistent with Mx genes in other species. By immunostaining BALB/3T3 fibroblasts transiently transfected FLAG epitope-tagged canine Mx1 and Mx2 cDNAs with an anti-FLAG tag, it was revealed that both Mx1 and Mx2 proteins are localized in cytoplasm. BALB/3T3 fibroblasts expressing stably Mx2 but not Mx1 had an antiviral activity against recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). This is the first report demonstrating the functional analysis of canine Mx proteins.
