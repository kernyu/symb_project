OBJECTIVES: The main objective of the present study was to detect point mutations at positions 86, 184, 1034, 1042, and 1246 of the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance gene (pfmdr1) in blood samples collected from malaria patients in Chabahar, a harbor city located in Southeast Iran. METHODS: Twenty-six blood samples from patients infected with P. falciparum, who had a chloroquine (CQ) response failure, were collected pre-treatment. Following treatment with CQ, drug susceptibility was assessed using an in vivo test. Molecular detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was carried out using the LightCycler hybridization probe assay. RESULTS: The pfmdr1 N86Y mutation was found in six isolates (23.1%). Mutations at the four other positions were not observed in any isolates. CONCLUSION: The present study showed no mutation at codon positions 184, 1034, 1042, and 1246 of pfmdr1 in any of the Iranian P. falciparum isolates; thus these alleles cannot serve as markers for CQ resistance in Iran.
