The in vitro activity of NND-502, a novel antifungal imidazole compound, was tested against the three major Malassezia species by an agar dilution method with modified Dixon medium and compared with the activities of three reference antifungal drugs of topical use, lanoconazole (LCZ), bifonazole (BFZ) and terbinafine (TBF). The geometric mean (GM)-MICs of NND-502 for 25 strains of M. furfur, 15 strains of M. sympodialis and ten strains of M. slooffiae were approximately 1.4, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/l, respectively, showing the greatest activity against M. sympodialis and the least against M. slooffiae. These values were similar to that of LCZ, but four to 69 times lower than that of BFZ and two to three times lower than that of TBF. The results suggest that NND-502 might be beneficial in the treatment of Malassezia-associated skin diseases.
