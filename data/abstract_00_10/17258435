We used the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) method to study the genetic diversity of Campylobacter coli isolated from chickens in Senegal, and to check the presence of genetic exchange with Campylobacter jejuni. In addition, we assessed the resistance of the isolates to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid, and their gyrA sequences. MLST revealed a low level of diversity and the absence of lineages among C. coli isolates. In addition, an exchange of alleles with C. jejuni was found. Twenty percent of the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates lacked mutations within the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of GyrA. There was no link between quinolone resistance and sequence type (ST).
