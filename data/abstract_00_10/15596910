Although the overall cure rate for advanced germ cell tumor (GCT) is high, the prognosis for patients with cisplatin-refractory GCT remains poor. Gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and oxaliplatin have shown significant activity as single agents in these patients. We investigated the activity and tolerance of a weekly gemcitabine, paclitaxel, oxaliplatin chemotherapy regimen. From September 2000 to February 2002, 9 patients with cisplatin-refractory GCT were treated with gemcitabine 800 mg/m2, paclitaxel 70 mg/m2, and oxaliplatin 50 mg/m2, days 1, 8, and 15, every 4 weeks. Only 1 patient stayed on schedule. In 7 patients, chemotherapy treatment was modified due to grade 3-4 hematological toxicity, whereas in another patient, who received high-dose chemotherapy 2 months before, chemotherapy was administered biweekly. In total, 21 cycles were administered with a median of 2 cycles for each patient. One patient achieved a partial remission lasting 5 months, 1 had disease stabilization for 5 months, whereas 7 had progressive disease. This chemotherapy regimen was not feasible in our patient population. Recently, oxaliplatin at full doses, but not as weekly administration, has appeared to possess activity in cisplatin-refractory GCT. Thus, we plan a phase II study protocol of the oxaliplatin and gemcitabine combination at full doses every 3 weeks.
