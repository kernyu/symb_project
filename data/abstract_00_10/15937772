We reviewed all of the published reports of cases of fluoroquinolone treatment failures for respiratory tract infection due to fluoroquinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. There were 20 ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin treatment failures reported. Physicians should be aware, when treating pneumococcal respiratory tract infections in older patients with a fluoroquinolone, that clinical failures might occur, especially for patients with comorbid illnesses and a history of recent fluoroquinolone use.
