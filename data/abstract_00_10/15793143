We investigated the ability of p53 in cytoplasm to excise nucleoside analogs (NAs). A decrease in incorporation of NAs by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase and their excision from DNA by p53, provided by the cytoplasmic fraction of LCC2 cells, suggest that p53 in cytoplasm may act as an external proofreader for NA incorporation.
