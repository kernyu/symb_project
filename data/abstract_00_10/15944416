Three variants of Candida albicans CYP51 (sterol 14-demethylase P450) having Y132H and/or F145L substitutions were purified and characterized to reveal the effects of these amino acid substitutions on the enzymatic properties and azole resistance of the enzyme. Y132H and F145L substitutions modified the spectral properties of the enzyme, suggesting that they caused some structural change modifying the heme environments of CYP51. Y132H and F145L substitutions increased the resistance of the enzyme to azole compounds but considerably decreased the catalytic activity. This fact represents a trade-off between acquisition of azole resistance and maintenance of high activity in the CYP51 having Y132H and F145L substitutions. A fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strain DUMC136 isolated from patients receiving long-term azole treatment was a homozygote of the altered CYP51 having Y132H and F145L substitutions. However, neither of these substitutions was found in CYP51 of wild-type C. albicans so far studied. These facts suggest that the azole-resistant variant having Y132H and/or F145L substitutions might be selected only under azole-rich environments because of its azole resistance and impaired catalytic activity. This may be a live example showing one of the important processes of P450 diversification, the selection of altered P450 through the interaction with environmental compounds.
