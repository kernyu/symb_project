The study monitored the susceptibility of nosocomial pathogens to meropenem and comparator antimicrobial agents isolated as part of the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program from Turkish university hospitals. In terms of minimum inhibitory concentration 90% (MIC(90)) values, meropenem was two- and eight-fold more active than imipenem against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. 40.5% of K. pneumoniae, 23.1% of Klebsiella oxytoca and 15.3% of E. coli isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. Piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active agent against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by meropenem and imipenem. Against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, meropenem and imipenem were the most active agents. Continued surveillance by the MYSTIC Program appears to be prudent to help focus on effective empiric treatment regimens.
