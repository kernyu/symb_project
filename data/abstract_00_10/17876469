The frequency and distribution of mutations in Plasmodium falciparum, dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase genes were analyzed, using the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology, in infected blood samples from Mozambican children living in Maputo, before and seven days after treatment with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (S/P). The results showed the occurrence of point mutations in the genes studied and the presence of combinations of three alleles in dhfr (51Ile, 59Arg and 108Asn) and "quintuple" mutant (dhfr 51Ile, 59Arg, 108Asn and dhps 437Gly, 540Glu). Both of these situations were associated with seven-day therapeutic failure, following treatment with S/P. These findings show the importance of studying S/P resistance in Mozambique, and how molecular markers for antimalarial resistance can provide important data for national malaria control policy.
