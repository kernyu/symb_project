The prevention of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization and infection continues to be a high priority for clinicians. An oral antimicrobial agent that reduces or eliminates VRE gastrointestinal colonization could be useful for preventing VRE infection in selected patients. Ramoplanin, a glycolipodepsipeptide, is the first in a new class of antimicrobials. It has excellent in vitro activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis. It is orally administered, and not absorbed systemically. In clinical trials, VRE gastrointestinal colonization was reduced to undetectable levels in 80-90% of patients during receipt of ramoplanin. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicentre study is currently being conducted to determine whether ramoplanin will prevent VRE bloodstream infection in oncology patients who are neutropenic due to treatment for a haematological malignancy or a bone marrow/stem cell transplant.
