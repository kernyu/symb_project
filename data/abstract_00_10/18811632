OBJECTIVES: Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is a major cause of bacterial infection after deceased-donor liver transplantation. The incidence and risk factors of P. aeruginosa infection after living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT), however, are not known. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data from 170 adult patients who underwent LDLT at the University of Tokyo Hospital. The microbiologic and medical records of the patients from admission to 3 months after LDLT were reviewed. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the independent risk factors for postoperative P. aeruginosa infection. RESULT: Preoperative P. aeruginosa carriage was identified in 15 (9%) patients. Only 2 of the 15 patients later presented with postoperative P. aeruginosa infection. Postoperative P. aeruginosa infection occurred in 27 (16%) of 170 patients by median postoperative day 38. Among those 27 patients, surgical site infections were recorded in 8 (30%) and intra-abdominal infections in 14 (52%). In 5 of the 27 (19%) patients, P. aeruginosa isolates were multiple antimicrobial resistant. Postoperative bile leakage independently predicted postoperative P. aeruginosa infection. CONCLUSION: P. aeruginosa infections were frequently detected after LDLT, including those by multiple antimicrobial-resistant isolates. Postoperative bile leakage predisposed patients to P. aeruginosa infection. Surveillance culture should be checked periodically after LDLT to ensure that appropriate antimicrobials can be administered for postoperative infection.
