AIM: To examine the extent to which staff nurses feel that MRSA is out of control and that any attempts by them to control it are unnecessary. METHOD: A qualitative research paradigm with semi-structured interviews to examine the perceptions, attitudes and beliefs of 10 senior staff nurses. RESULTS: In the study, 60% of participants believe that MRSA is out of control and state 'why should they bother worrying about it'. Furthermore, 80% of participants commented that prescribed courses of nasal mupirocin were frequently missed. The perception is that IV treatments were more important and effective than topical agents. CONCLUSION: The study has established that a small section of experienced staff nurses perceive MRSA to be out of control and they are not overly concerned about its management.
