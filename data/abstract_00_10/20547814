A nationwide study aimed to identify the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs), and extended-spectrum oxacillinases (ES-OXAs) in a French collection of 140 clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates highly resistant to ceftazidime. Six ESBLs (PER-1, n=3; SHV-2a, n=2; VEB-1a, n=1), four MBLs (VIM-2, n=3; IMP-18, n=1), and five ES-OXAs (OXA-19, n=4; OXA-28, n=1) were identified in 13 isolates (9.3% of the collection). The prevalence of these enzymes is still low in French clinical P. aeruginosa isolates but deserves to be closely monitored.
