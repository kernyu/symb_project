UNLABELLED: Helicobacter pylori infection is frequent in children. The eradication rate is variable, it is influenced by resistance of the bacteria to the antibiotics used. The aim of this study was to determine the resistance rate of the most commonly used antibiotics among helicobacter pylori (Hp) strains isolated in infected children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 60 children (26 males, 34 females), with mean age of 8 years 8 months (3 years and 2 month (2.5-13.5 years) underwent an oesogastroscopy. Forty six of them had helicobacter infection assessed by the presence of Hp on the gastric biopsy and or positivity of urease test. The infected children were treated with three medication; Omeprazole. Clarythromycin, and Amoxicillin. The eradication of Hp was confirmed in 13 patients by the absence of Hp on the gastric biopsy and/or negativation of the urease test; RESULTS: Culture was positive in 13 infected children susceptibility to anti microbial drugs was done in ten children. Nine children had primary metronidazole resistance, three had both clarythromycin and Metronidazole resistance, three had Clarythromycin primary resistance. No case of Amoxicillin primary resistance was detected. Children eradication was achieved in four children among 13 children. This study shows the difficulty of Hp culture. It confirms the absence of Hp resistance to Amoxicilline. the high level of Hp resistance to Metronidazole and the mild level of Clarythromycin resistance. The authors stress the importance of Antibiotic susceptibility assay in helicobacter pylori infections.
