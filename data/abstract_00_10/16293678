These evidence-based guidelines have been produced after a literature review of the laboratory diagnosis and susceptibility testing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We have considered the detection of MRSA in screening samples and the detection of reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in S. aureus. Recommendations are given for the identification of S. aureus and for suitable methods of susceptibility testing and screening for MRSA and for S. aureus with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides. These guidelines indicate what tests should be used but not when the tests are applicable, as aspects of this are dealt with in guidelines on control of MRSA. There are currently several developments in screening media and molecular methods. It is likely that some of our recommendations will require modification as the new methods become available.
