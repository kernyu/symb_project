Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can cause serious problems after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The death of a pediatric transplant recipient after reactivation of a postnatal HCMV infection with bilateral retinitis and pneumonitis is described. Sequencing of the HCMV UL97 region revealed a compartment-specific mutation (H520Q) in urine conferring ganciclovir resistance.
