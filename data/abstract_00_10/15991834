Culturing fresh clinical isolates of P. falciparum and using the isotopic method, we tested separately chloroquine and isradipine--a calcium channel blocker--, and also the combination isradipine plus chloroquine. Tested wild isolates were chloroquine-sensitive. With regard to the combination isradipine/chloroquine, the isobolograms obtained indicate that isradipine antagonises chloroquine antiplasmodial activity. Taking into account these findings, we discuss the issues related to the calcium channel blocker molecules.
