The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection increases with age world-wide, reaching levels of 40-60% in asymptomatic elderly subjects and over 70% in elderly patients with gastroduodenal diseases. However, the percentage of H. pylori-positive elderly patients who are treated for their infection remains very low. Data are now available that demonstrate the benefit of curing H. pylori infection in elderly patients with H. pylori-associated peptic ulcer disease and severe chronic gastritis. Furthermore, the cure of H. pylori may prevent the progression of intestinal metaplasia and gastric atrophy. New studies are needed to clarify the role of eradication in elderly patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and in those who use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. H. pylori infection may be easily diagnosed by histological evaluation, rapid urease test or culture performed on gastric biopsies taken during endoscopy. However, the biopsy site must be carefully selected in elderly patients. For non-invasive monitoring of H. pylori infection after treatment, the 13C-urea breath test has significantly higher accuracy than serology in the elderly; further studies are needed to clarify the role of the H. pylori stool antigen test in old age. One-week proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy regimens, including clarithromycin, amoxicillin and/or nitroimidazoles, are highly effective and well tolerated in elderly patients. Low doses of both proton pump inhibitors and clarithromycin (in combination with standard doses of amoxicillin or nitroimidazoles) are sufficient. Low compliance and antibiotic resistance are the main factors related to treatment failure in old age.
