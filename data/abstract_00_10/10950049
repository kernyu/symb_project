OBJECTIVE: Cyclosporin-A (CSA) has been demonstrated to be effective for treatment of severe, steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis (UC). Use of CSA has been limited, however, because of low 1-yr response rates and the potential for complications. The aim of this study is to define clinical and laboratory factors predictive of response in severe, steroid-resistant UC. METHODS: A retrospective review of 36 cases of severe, steroid-resistant UC treated with CSA was performed. Intravenous (i.v.) CSA was administered at an initial dose of 2.5 mg/kg, and oral (p.o.) CSA was given as twice the i.v. dose. Clinical response was recorded and logistic regression analysis was performed on clinical and laboratory factors for prediction of response to CSA. RESULTS: Of 36 patients, 25 responded to i.v. CSA and were switched to p.o. CSA. Of the 25, 13 required colectomy by 9 months. The other 12 patients had a sustained response to CSA and avoided colectomy at 9 months. Overall, 24 of 36 patients treated with CSA required colectomy by 9 months. A high percentage of band neutrophils (bands) on admission was found to be a significant predictor of response to CSA. CONCLUSIONS: Bands on admission are predictive of response to CSA and ultimately, the requirement for surgery in steroid-resistant UC.
