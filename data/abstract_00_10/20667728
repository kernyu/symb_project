Trichomonas vaginalis, a human-infectious protozoan, can display resistance to treatment by metronidazole. A library of 3,4-dichloroaniline amides based on propanil, an herbicide, has been synthesized and screened to test susceptibility to these analogs. From this preliminary study, the most effective compound 15, inhibits growth of the organism by 66% and 69% on the two strains tested, T1 and G3, respectively.
