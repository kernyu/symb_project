IRF9/p48/ISGF3gamma (IRF9) is an IFN regulatory factor that mediates signaling by type I IFNs (IFNalpha and IFNbeta). After single-step selection of breast adenocarcinoma cells in paclitaxel, differential display and single gene analysis demonstrated that transcriptional activation of IRF9 and other IFN-responsive genes, independent of IFN, corresponded with resistance to antimicrotubule agents. Transient overexpression of IRF9 reproduced the drug-resistance phenotype and induced expression of IFN-responsive genes. However, drug resistance was not induced by overexpression of Stat1 or Stat2, or treatment with IFNalpha per se. Using a donor-matched array of cDNA prepared from human tumor and normal tissue from a variety of organs, we observed overexpression of IRF9 in approximately one-half of breast and uterine tumors, which indicated that IRF9 may be important in signaling in these tumor types. These data identify a novel IFN-independent role for IRF9 in the development of resistance to antimicrotubule agents in breast tumor cells and may link downstream mediators of IFN signaling to drug resistance in human cancers.
