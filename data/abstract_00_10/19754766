Mucormycosis (zygomycosis) is an uncommon infection that afflicts severely immunocompromised patients and those with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. A recent increase in the incidence of mucormycosis at many transplant centres has been linked to the introduction and widespread use of voriconazole prophylaxis in these high-risk populations. However, it is not known if this association reflects a true epidemiological link or represents a marker of changing immunosuppression occurring in parallel with the evolution of transplant practices and immunosuppression strategies.
