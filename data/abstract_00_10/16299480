We developed a microarray hybridization-based method, 'comparative genome sequencing' (CGS), to find mutations in bacterial genomes and used it to study metronidazole resistance in H. pylori. CGS identified mutations in several genes, most likely affecting metronidazole activation, and produced no false positives in analysis of three megabases. We conclude that CGS identifies mutations in bacterial genomes efficiently, should enrich understanding of systems biology and genome evolution, and help track pathogens during outbreaks.
