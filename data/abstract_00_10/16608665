For patients initiating antiretroviral therapy, there are several well-tolerated once-daily regimens from which to choose. Once-daily antiretroviral therapy may be ideal for patient adherence and convenience. However, results of a few recent clinical trials exploring new once-daily regimens have shown that one cannot assume that any three-drug combination will be successful. Once-daily therapy options for treatment-experienced patients are more limited but may be successful depending on prior antiretroviral treatment exposure and resistance mutations. Current approaches to once-daily therapy include simplifying successful regimens and investigating novel antiretroviral agents with long half-lives.
