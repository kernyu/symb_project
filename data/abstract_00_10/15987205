[reaction: see text] A novel method for achieving the desired regioselective reduction of the N-1 azido group on a tetraazidoneamine has been developed that leads to the synthesis of both kanamycin and neomycin class antibiotics bearing N-1 modification. Both classes of aminoglycosides are active against aminoglycoside-resistant bacteria carrying APH(3')-I and AAC(6')/APH(2'').
