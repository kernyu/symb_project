OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial resistance and bacterial distribution of nosocomial pneumonia in neurosurgical patients. METHODS: We analyzed and counted the result of sputum culture, drug sensibilities test, and the rate of nosocomial pneumonia after intracranial surgery of all the patients in the Department of in Neurosurgery our hospital in 2002. RESULTS: The rate of nosocomial pneumonia after intracranial surgery was 6.2%. The first 5 strains were pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacteriaceae, klebsiella, and staphylococcus epidermidis. Statistics of drug sensibility test suggested:the rate of ampicillin and cefuroxime resistance was over 83%. Gram-negative bacterium was the first sensitive to sulperazon and imipenem. Gram-positive bacterium was the first sensitive to vancomycin, ampicillin/sulbactam and rifampicin. CONCLUSION: The rate of neurosurgical infection was high. The most common pathogens were gram-negative bacteria. Drug resistance was serious.
