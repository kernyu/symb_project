The frequency of infections caused by drug-resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) in solid-organ transplant recipients is not known. Only a few resistant strains have been described in transplant recipients. Antiviral susceptibility to ganciclovir (GCV) and foscarnet (PFA) of CMV isolates from 24 renal transplant patients with CMV viremia and CMV disease before and after therapy were investigated by a solid phase ELISA. The CMV DNA polymerase (UL54) and viral phosphotransferase (UL97) genes were also sequenced. Ten patients did not receive antiviral treatment; five and nine patients were treated with PFA and GCV, respectively. No appearance of drug-resistant viruses was observed in the present study, but one isolate showed a reduced sensitivity to PFA after treatment with GCV. This finding could not be explained by the presence or development of mutations that have been associated with drug resistance in UL54. We found no evidence that short-term treatment of CMV with PFA- or GCV-induced resistance.
