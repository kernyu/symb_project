OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of drug resistance mutations among antiretroviral treatment-naive and -experienced patients infected with CRF01_AE virus. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. METHODS: We recruited antiretroviral-experienced HIV-infected patients with suspected drug resistance and consecutive newly diagnosed drug-naive patients. Viral sequencing was performed using standard methods. Frequencies of mutations in CRF01_AE virus isolates were compared with reference data for subtype B virus. RESULTS: Sequences were obtained for CRF01_AE virus isolates from 69 patients with treatment exposure and 35 treatment-naive patients. Treatment-naive patients had numerous polymorphisms but no major drug resistance mutations. There were differences between CRF01_AE and subtype B viruses in several drug resistance mutations including the following: D67N, L210F, K101E, V106M, V179I/D, G190A/S/E, and G48V (which were more common in CRF01_AE virus) and M41L, T215Y, and V82A (which were less common in CRF01_AE virus). CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of treatment-related mutations in CRF01_AE virus differs from that in subtype B virus at a number of positions determining drug resistance. Understanding these differences is important for interpreting results of resistance tests and determining treatment choices.
