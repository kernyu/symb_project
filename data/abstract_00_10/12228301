Following infection of susceptible BALB/c mice with Leishmania major, early production of interleukin-4 (IL-4) is associated with the development of a nonprotective Th2 response and the development of progressive disease. Treatment of mice with IL-12 at the time of infection can promote the activation of a protective Th1 response; however, IL-12 treatment of mice with established infections has little effect on the progress of lesion development. This may be due to a down-regulation of the IL-12 receptor beta2 chain (IL-12Rbeta2) that accompanies the expansion of IL-4-producing Th2 cells. We have examined whether prostaglandins function to regulate in vivo responsiveness to IL-12. Mice treated with indomethacin are responsive to treatment with exogenous IL-12 through at least the first 2 weeks of infection and, unlike control mice treated with IL-12, develop an enhanced Th1-type response associated with increased enhanced resistance to infection. Cells from indomethacin-treated mice also exhibit enhanced production of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) following in vitro stimulation with IL-12. Although in vivo indomethacin treatment did not appear to influence IL-12 production in infected mice, cells from indomethacin-treated mice did express higher levels of IL-12Rbeta2, suggesting that prostaglandins may play a role in the loss of IL-12 responsiveness observed during nonhealing L. major infections.
