Among 144 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli isolated in Brazil, one (0.69%) QnrA1-producing isolate was detected. The qnrA1 gene was associated with ISCR1. The QnrA1 determinant was carried on a 41-kb conjugative plasmid, which also carried a FOX-type cephalosporinase encoding gene and a class 1 integron with the aadB and catB3 cassettes. This is the first report of a qnrA-carrying isolate in a Latin American country.
