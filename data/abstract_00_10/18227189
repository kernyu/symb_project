Canadian invasive Haemophilus influenzae isolates from 1990 to 2006 were examined for antibiotic susceptibility: 42 strains (17.8%) were resistant to ampicillin by beta-lactamase production, 5.5% were beta-lactamase negative ampicillin intermediate, and 2.5% were intermediate to only the 2-microg ampicillin disk. An increase in beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-intermediate strains has been found.
