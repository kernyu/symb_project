The presence of the multidrug efflux pump SmeDEF was assessed in a collection of clinical isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. All isolates encoded this pump, as demonstrated by PCR. Forty-seven percent of the strains overproduced a protein of the same size that was immunoreactive against an anti-SmeF antibody, and 33% overexpressed the gene semD when they were tested by reverse transcription-PCR. A correlation between smeDEF overexpression and antibiotic resistance was observed.
