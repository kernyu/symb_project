Continuous HAART is standard of care for HIV-infected patients but lifelong adherence and tolerance are important concerns. Use of ART is associated with potential risks, e. g., adverse events, metabolic and cardiovascular complications, and HIV resistance. Stopping HIV therapy may reduce costs and side effects, but carries the risk of increased immune suppression and of emergence of resistance. Treatment interruption is a strategy of much interest, but its safety and efficacy have not been established. The clinical and biological characteristics that influence the outcome of structured treatment interruptions have not been fully clarified. In the following we will present the results of recent studies aimed to compare the long-term consequences of two antiretroviral-management strategies: continuous therapy versus scheduled treatment interruption.
