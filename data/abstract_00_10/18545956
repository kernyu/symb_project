BACKGROUND: The ABS International group conducted a survey to estimate the prevalence and characteristics of country-specific hospital antibiotic management programs. This paper summarizes the results for the north-eastern area of Italy. METHODS: The survey was conducted in January and February 2008. A questionnaire with items related to hospital antibiotic management was sent to the medical administrators of two regions, namely Veneto and Trentino Alto Adige, which are further subdivided into smaller administrative areas. MAIN FINDINGS: Ten out of 82 questionnaires were returned and nine were evaluable. The mean total score for all items in the areas under consideration was 3.69 (median: 3.58; range 2.58-4.50). Top values and high mean scores were achieved for diagnostics and control of antibiotic consumption. Organizational structures such as well defined antibiotic-related roles and communication tools are missing to a large degree. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this questionnaire-based survey underline the considerable potential for further improvement of antibiotic stewardship in north-eastern Italy.
