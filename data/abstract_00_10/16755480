Pediatric extended care facilities provide for the biopsychosocial needs of patients younger than 21 years of age who have sustained self-care deficits. These facilities include long-term and residential care facilities, chronic disease and specialty hospitals, and residential schools. Infection control policies and procedures developed for adult long-term care facilities, primarily nursing homes for elderly people, are not applicable to long-term care facilities that serve pediatric patients. This article reviews the characteristics of pediatric extended care facilities and their residents, and the epidemic and endemic nosocomial infections, infection control programs, and antimicrobial resistance profiles found in pediatric extended care facilities.
