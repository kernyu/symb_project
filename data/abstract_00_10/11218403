There is general agreement that H. pylori should be eradicated in patients with peptic ulcers. But the optimal therapeutical regimen to be used still remains a matter for many investigations. An increase in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant H. pylori strains has been reported recently. The recommended drugs for the eradication in Japan are clarithromycin (CAM) and amoxicillin (AMPC) because metronidazole (MNZ) is anti-parasites drug in Japan. A total of 392 H. pylori strains in the last twelve years were tested for sensitivity to CAM, MNZ, and AMPC. The Primary resistance of H. pylori to CAM, MNZ, and AMPC were found in 10.2%, 26.5%, and 0.3% strains, respectively. The resistant strains to CAM were gradually increasing in the last few years. The eradication therapies which do not increase antibiotics resistant strains after eradication failure were reported. The recommendation for eradication in patients with peptic ulcer disease includes those with bleeding ulcers. The pretreatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) does not influence the success of PPI-based triple therapy in eradicating H. pylori.
