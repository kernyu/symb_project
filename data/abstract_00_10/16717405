Since the first introduction of the sulfa drugs and penicillin into clinical use, large numbers of antibiotics have been developed and hence contributed to human health. But extensive use of antibiotics has raised a serious public health problem due to multiantibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens that inevitably develop resistance to every new drug launched in the clinic. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop new antibiotics to keep pace with bacterial resistance. Recent advances in microbial genomics and X-ray crystallography provide opportunities to identify novel antibacterial targets for the development of new classes of antibiotics and to design more potent antimicrobial compounds derived from existing antibiotics respectively. To prevent and control infectious diseases caused by multiantibiotic resistant bacteria, we need to understand more about the molecular aspects of the pathogens' physiology and to pursue ways to prolong the life of precious antibiotics.
