OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to study the antimicrobial susceptibilities and macrolide resistance mechanisms of viridans group streptococci (VGS) in a Korean tertiary hospital. METHODS: MICs of five antimicrobials were determined for 106 VGS isolated from blood cultures. The macrolide resistance mechanisms of erythromycin non-susceptible isolates were studied by the double-disc test and PCR. RESULTS: In all, 42.4% of the isolates were susceptible to penicillin. Nine of 61 penicillin non-susceptible isolates were fully resistant (MIC >/= 4 mg/L). Rates of non-susceptibility to erythromycin, clindamycin and ceftriaxone were 33.9%, 17.9% and 9.4%, respectively. Twenty-two (61.1%) of 36 erythromycin non-susceptible isolates expressed constitutive resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B antibiotics (a constitutive MLS(B) phenotype); 13 isolates (36.1%) expressed an M phenotype; and one isolate, a Streptococcus bovis isolate, had an inducible MLS(B) resistance phenotype. erm(B) was found in isolates with constitutive/inducible MLS(B) phenotypes, and mef(A) in isolates with the M phenotype. In three isolates (two isolates with a constitutive MLS(B) phenotype and in one isolate with the M phenotype), none of erm(A), erm(B), erm(C) or mef(A) was detected by PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillin non-susceptible VGS were more resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin and ceftriaxone than were penicillin-susceptible isolates. A constitutive MLS(B) phenotype associated with erm(B) was the predominant mechanism of macrolide resistance among erythromycin non-susceptible isolates from this Korean hospital.
