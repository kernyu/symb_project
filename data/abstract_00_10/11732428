A guideline on the harmonisation of national antimicrobial resistance monitoring and surveillance programmes in animals and animal-derived foods has been developed by the Ad hoc Group of experts on antimicrobial resistance of the Office International des Epizooties. The objective of the guideline is to allow the generation of comparable data from various national surveillance and monitoring systems in order to compare the situations in different regions or countries and to consolidate results at the national, regional and international level. Definitions of surveillance and monitoring are provided. National systems should be able to detect the emergence of resistance, and to determine the prevalence of resistant bacteria. The resulting data should be used in the assessment of risks to public health and should contribute to the establishment of a risk management policy. Specific factors identified for harmonisation include the animal species, food commodities, sampling plans, bacterial species, antimicrobials to be tested, laboratory methods, data reporting, database structure and the structure of reports.
