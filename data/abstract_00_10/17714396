AIMS: To determine the resistance of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis HV219 to acids, bile, antibiotics, inflammatory drugs and spermicides, compare adsorption of the strain to bacteria and Caco-2 cells under stress, and evaluate the antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin HV219. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacteriocin HV219 activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was confirmed by leakage of DNA and beta-galactosidase, and atomic force microscopy. Adsorption of bacteriocin HV219 to bacteria is influenced by pH, temperature, surfactants and salts. Initially, only 3% of HV219 cells adhered to Caco-2 cells. However, after 2 h, adherence increased to 7%. Strain HV219 and Listeria monocytogenes ScottA did not compete for colonization. Strain HV219 is sensitive to most antibiotics tested, but resistant to amikacin, ceftazidime, nalidixic acid, metronidazole, neomycin, oxacillin, streptomycin, sulphafurazole, sulphamethoxazole, sulphonamides, tetracycline and tobramycin. Ibuprofen, ciprofloxacin, diklofenak and nonoxylol-9 inhibited the growth of strain HV219. CONCLUSION: Strain HV219 is resistant to hostile conditions in the intestinal tract, including therapeutic levels of specific antibiotics and binds to Caco-2 cells, but not in competition with L. monocytogenes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Strain HV219 will only be effective as probiotic if taken with specific antibiotics and not with anti-inflammatory drugs and spermicides.
