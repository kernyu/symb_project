Plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are used on crops most often as seed treatments; however, an alternative application method for transplanted vegetables is mixing PGPR into the soilless medium in which the transplants are grown. Studies were undertaken to compare root colonization and persistence of rifampicin-resistant mutants of PGPR strains Bacillus pumilus SE34 and Pseudomonas fluorescens 89B61, SE34r and 89B61r, on tomato as a function of application method. When the bacteria were incorporated into Promix soilless medium at log 6, 7, and 8 colony- forming units/g, populations of strain SE34r per gram of medium maintained the initial inoculum densities, while populations of 89B61r decreased approximately one to two orders of magnitude by 4 weeks after planting. The populations of each PGPR strain colonizing roots after application into the soilless medium showed a similar pattern at 6 weeks as that at 4 weeks after planting, with higher populations on the whole roots and lateral roots than on the taproots. Strain SE34r but not 89B61r moved upwards and colonized the phyllosphere when incorporated into the soilless medium. Following application as seed treatment, populations of SE34r were significantly higher on upper roots and on the taproot than were populations following application through the soilless medium. Conversely, populations were higher on lower roots and lateral roots following application through the soilless medium than were populations following application as seed treatment. While strain SE34 enhanced plant growth with application both to the medium and as seed treatment, the level of growth promotion was significantly greater with application in the soilless medium. The results indicate that PGPR can be successfully incorporated into soilless media in vegetable transplant production systems.
