The efficacy of ME1036, a novel parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of vancomycin by using a rabbit model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis. Compared with vancomycin, ME1036 reduced the bacterial counts in the vegetations at a lower dosage or over a shorter period of administration when it was used for the treatment of MRSA endocarditis.
