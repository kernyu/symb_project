The effects of H(2)O(2) on the membrane potential of smooth muscle cells of rabbit mesenteric resistance arteries were investigated. H(2)O(2) (3-30 microM) concentration-dependently hyperpolarized the membrane; this was inhibited by catalase but not by superoxide dismutase or the hydroxyl-radical scavenger dimethylthiourea. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac partly inhibited the responses; the subsequent addition of the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor 2-(12-hydroxydodeca-5,10-diynyl)-3,5,6-trimethyl-p-benzoquinone (AA-861) (but not the cytochrome P(450) inhibitor 17-octadecynoic acid) further attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced hyperpolarizations. The sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel inhibitor 1-[5-[2-(5-chloro-o-anisamido)ethyl]-2-methoxyphenylsulfonyl]-3-methylthiourea, sodium salt (HMR-1098), blocked the H(2)O(2)-induced hyperpolarization in the absence and presence of diclofenac. H(2)O(2) increased the production of prostaglandin E(2) and prostacyclin (estimated from its stable metabolite 6-keto-prostaglandin F(1alpha)), both of which produce a HMR-1098-sensitive hyperpolarization in the smooth muscle cells. It is concluded that, in smooth muscle cells of rabbit mesenteric artery, H(2)O(2) increases the synthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins and possibly 5-lipoxygenase products, which produce a hyperpolarization by activating sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels.
