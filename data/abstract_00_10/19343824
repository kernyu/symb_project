The aim of this study was the molecular characterization of primary drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in Thailand. We examined a group of M. tuberculosis isolates from newly registered tuberculosis (TB) cases, collected at the largest university hospital, the Siriraj Hospital, in Thailand. Of 76 selected drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains recovered from previously untreated pulmonary TB patients whose sputum samples were sent to this hospital, 29 (38%) were single-drug resistant, 26(34%) multidrug resistant and two (2.6%) extensively drug resistant. Fifty (66%) strains belonged to Beijing genotype. The study demonstrated a severe problem of drug resistance among recently detected TB patients, and two large clusters of genetically similar strains indicated ongoing transmission of drug-resistant TB.
