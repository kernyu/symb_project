OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of long-term high-physiological-dose recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy on fat distribution and glucose metabolism in HIV-infected patients. METHODS: Forty-six HIV-infected Caucasian men on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with an age range of 21-60 years and no significant comorbidity, were included in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-centre trial. Twenty-eight subjects were randomized to 0.7 mg/day rhGH, and 18 subjects to placebo, administered as daily subcutaneous injections between 1 and 3 pm for 40 weeks. Endpoints included changes in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), limb fat mass, percentage of limb fat, plasma lipids, insulin resistance and glucose tolerance. RESULTS: VAT and trunk fat mass decreased significantly in the GH group compared with the placebo group [-19 cm(2) (-11%) vs. 12 cm(2) (6%), P=0.03, and -548 g (-9%) vs. 353 g (6%), P<0.01, respectively]. The beneficial fat redistribution in the GH group occurred without concomitant changes in subcutaneous fat at the abdomen or extremities. rhGH therapy was well tolerated. Insulin resistance, glucose tolerance, and total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides did not significantly change during intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Daily 0.7 mg rhGH treatment for 40 weeks reduced abdominal visceral fat and trunk fat mass in HIV-infected patients. This treatment appeared to be safe with respect to glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.
