In this study, 326 Escherichia coli isolates from food animals collected during the last four decades in China were characterized using antimicrobial susceptibility testing and screening for integrons/cassettes. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing indicated that the antimicrobial resistance of E. coli has increased since the 1970s. The findings of this study present a warning to veterinary practitioners about the excessive use of antimicrobials, and suggest the necessity for surveillance and control of antimicrobial resistance in veterinary clinical medicine in China.
