Antimicrobial resistance has been a problem ever since the introduction of antimicrobial agents 60 years ago. Today, this problem is increasing so rapidly that the end of the antimicrobial era is being predicted. The increasing problems caused by antimicrobial resistance can be illustrated by those seen in bacterial pathogens that cause community acquired respiratory tract infections, which are among the most common and important infections seen by clinicians. Bacterial pathogens causing community acquired respiratory tract infections have a number of resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamases. Recognition of these resistance mechanisms allows them to be targeted, such as with beta-lactamase inhibitors. Newly recognized resistance mechanisms such as efflux may also be targeted in the future.
