A high use of antibiotics and a high resistance rate in some of the most common microorganisms have been found in Spain; evidence shows they are related. The appearance of organisms with high rates of antibiotic resistance represents a clinical and general problem with possibly catastrophic consequences. Primary health care and prehospital emergency departments are the places where 3 out of every 4 antibiotics are prescribed for children, most of them for respiratory infections. The data show a high number of inappropriate prescriptions according to standard therapeutic guidelines. To reverse this situation, it is necessary to implement multilateral and systematic interventions that are sustainable over time; some addressed to the general population and others to healthcare professionals. The general population needs to have reasonable expectations of antibiotics, based on accurate information. Health professionals need training (self-education), means (access to information sources), and time (organisation), to tackle this complex issue. The goal of this article is to highlight the importance of the problem of antibiotic resistance and its clinical consequences, such as treatment failure, and to promote the prudent use of antibiotics in paediatric care by suggesting measures that can be implemented in the healthcare system.
