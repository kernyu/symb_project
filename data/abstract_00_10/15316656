In this study with cycloheximide (CHX, an inhibitor of protein synthesis) and the human leukaemic cell line U937, a novel form of chemoresistance, which we termed sudden drug resistance (SDR), was identified using Hoechst33258 staining, Western blot and DNA Ladder. CHXhigh (10-100 microg/ml)-induced apoptosis can spontaneously subside after 4-6 h or can be inhibited by short-term preincubation with CHXlow (2.5 microg/ml). Unlike typical multidrug resistance, SDR is not caused by reduced drug accumulation or altered protein expression, and may be associated with a non-P-glycoprotein mechanism. To uncover this underlying mechanism, we focused on U937 cell aggregation promoted by CHX, because cell adhesion has been suggested to influence cell survival and prevent apoptosis. EDTA, or anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody, but not EGTA, acetylsalicylic acid or RGDS tetrapeptide, abrogated this homotypic aggregation and greatly increased CHX-induced apoptosis in a time-dependent manner, while fibrinogen and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 exerted opposite effects. These results establish that beta2-integrin engagement is a key mediator of SDR, although it may be non-exclusive. This finding supplements the classical basis of chemoresistance and may provide another opportunity for improved leukemia therapy.
