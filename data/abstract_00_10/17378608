Two new steroidal sulfates, eurysterols A (1) and B (2), were isolated from an undescribed marine sponge of the genus Euryspongia collected in Palau. The structures of the new compounds were assigned by NMR spectroscopic data interpretation. Compounds 1 and 2 showed cytotoxicity against human colon carcinoma (HCT-116) cells with IC50 values of 2.9 and 14.3 microg/mL, respectively, and exhibited antifungal activity against amphotericin B-resistant and wild-type strains of Candida albicans with MIC values, in turn, of 15.6 and 62.5 microg/mL.
