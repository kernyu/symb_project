Despite the use of potent antimicrobials, neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis are associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The emergence of microbial antibiotic resistance is a grave concern. Inflammation secondary to sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis increases pulmonary and cerebral morbidity. New strategies that target inflammation and reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance are urgently needed. Lactoferrin has broad-spectrum antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities. In animal models of colitis, lactoferrin reduces inflammatory injury. Lactoferrin also induces the receptor-mediated proliferation and differentiation of intestinal cells. A randomized, controlled trial of lactoferrin in premature neonates to prevent late-onset sepsis is currently in progress. Lactoferrin is a promising agent in the prevention of neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis but needs further evaluation to confirm its safety, tolerability and efficacy.
