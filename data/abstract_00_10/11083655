Immunoblotting with antibody against AcrA, an obligatory component of the AcrAB multidrug efflux system, showed that this protein was overexpressed by >/=170% in 9 of 10 clinical isolates of Esherichia coli with high-level ciprofloxacin resistance (MICs, >/=32 microg/ml) but not in any of the 15 isolates for which the MIC was </=1 microg/ml.
