The Applied Biosystems ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System is a commercially available, integrated system for sequence-based analysis of drug resistance mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease and reverse transcriptase (RT). We evaluated the performance of this system for analysis of non-subtype B HIV-1 by analyzing plasma samples from Ugandan women and infants. Plasma samples were obtained from 105 women and 25 infants enrolled in a Ugandan clinical trial. HIV-1 analysis was performed with the ViroSeq system according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that the volume of plasma used for analysis was less than the recommended 0.5 ml for some samples. Viral loads ranged from 2,313 to 2,336,400 copies/ml. PCR products suitable for sequencing were amplified from all samples tested. Complete sequences for protease (amino acids 1 to 99) and RT (amino acids 1 to 320) were obtained for 102 of 105 (97%) of the maternal samples tested and all 25 of the infant samples tested. Complete double-stranded sequences were obtained for 90 of 105 (86%) of the maternal samples tested and 22 of 25 (88%) of the infant samples tested. The sequences obtained with this system were used for HIV-1 subtyping. The subtypes identified were A, C, D, and A/D recombinant HIV-1. The performances of the seven sequencing primers were similar for the subtypes examined. The ViroSeq system performs well for analysis of Ugandan plasma samples with subtypes A, C, D, and A/D recombinant HIV-1. The availability of this genotyping system should facilitate studies of HIV-1 drug resistance in countries where these subtypes are prevalent.
