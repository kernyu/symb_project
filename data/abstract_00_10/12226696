Ten oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strains were grown on agar containing four times their ciprofloxacin MIC to determine if exposure to ciprofloxacin would increase their resistance to oxacillin. All strains grew on the ciprofloxacin-containing agar and subsequently grew on oxacillin-salt agar. The geometric mean MICs for oxacillin increased one- to sixteen-fold and remained elevated after ten passages on antibiotic-free agar. The mecA gene was not detected in any strain. There was no increase in oxacillin MICs when the bacteria were passaged on agar containing four times their MIC of piperacillin/tazobactam. Exposure of oxacillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus to ciprofloxacin may increase their MICs to oxacillin.
