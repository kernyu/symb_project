Campylobacter spp. are an important cause of diarrhea in Kuwait. Because susceptibility data for ciprofloxacin and erythromycin, the two recommended drugs for treatment, are not available for this part of the world, 64 Campylobacter spp. isolates obtained from human diarrheal stools in Kuwait during 2000--2003 were studied for susceptibility to these antimicrobials by E-test. The utility of a simple mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA) PCR to detect base substitution in the gyrA gene mediating resistance to ciprofloxacin was also explored. Approximately, 53% (34/64) of the isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC, 4-64 microg/ml) and 5% (3/64) to erythromycin (MIC>256 microg/ml). MAMA PCR showed a Thr-86-to-Ile mutation in gyrA gene of 23/26 ciprofloxacin-resistant C. jejuni, and in all resistant C. coli. Sequencing of PCR product showed that two resistant strains of C. coli studied had Thr-86-to-Ile (ACT--> ATT) gyrA mutation and three resistant strains of C. jejuni studied had Thr-86-to-Ile (ACA--> ATA) gyrA mutation. In addition, all the three C. jejuni strains had silent mutations. Thus, ciprofloxacin is of limited use for treatment in Kuwait and MAMA PCR is a useful assay to study gyrA mutation. Because Kuwait has a large expatriate population of workers, it can be a focus of spread of antimicrobial resistance.
