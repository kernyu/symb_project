Mineralization of erythromycin A was studied using two differently (14)C-labeled erythromycins A, which were added to aquaculture sediment samples obtained from the two salmon hatchery sites in Washington state. The added erythromycin A did not significantly alter the numbers of the total viable colonies and erythromycin-resistant bacteria. Erythromycin-resistant Pseudomonas species contained a constitutive erythromycin esterase activity contributing to the inactivation of biologically active erythromycin A in aquatic and sediment environments. The initial rate of mineralization of erythromycin A appeared to be governed by the rate of release of soil-sorbed erythromycin A. After a prolonged lag time, the S-curves of erythromycin A mineralization were observed probably because of the increase in the population density metabolizing it. This study suggests that erythromycin A is partially or completely mineralized by the sediment microbial populations.
