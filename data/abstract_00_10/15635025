Susceptibilities to beta-lactam antibiotics of five VIM-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were determined by broth microdilution, Etest, disk diffusion, and the automated systems Vitek 2, Phoenix, and MicroScan. Significant discrepancies were observed in the determination of susceptibility to imipenem and meropenem. Interpretation problems by the automated systems were also noted.
