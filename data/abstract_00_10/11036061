A relationship between resistance to methicillin and resistance to fluoroquinolones, rifampin, and mupirocin has been described for Staphylococcus aureus. Differences in resistance rates may be explainable by a higher spontaneous mutation rate (MR) or a faster development of resistance (DIFF) in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). No differences in MR, DIFF, and mutations in grlA and gyrA were detected between methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and MRSA. The higher resistance rates in MRSA are not the result of hypermutability of target genes or a faster emergence of different mutations and may be the consequence of clonal spread of multiresistant MRSA.
