* Until now, no information has been available on the transcriptional response to the transduction of defense signals in brown seaweeds that leads to active resistance against pathogens or grazers. * Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based, subtractive cDNA approach combined with filter arrays we demonstrated that Laminaria digitata exhibits a rapid response to oligoguluronate elicitors. The transcription levels of several genes were validated by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR and further analysed using pharmacological approaches. * Fifty upregulated genes were identified by differential screening in elicited algae over a 24-h time-course. These genes were related to oxidative stress responses, production of antimicrobial secondary compounds or cell wall strengthening. Moreover, pharmacological tests showed that intracellular signal transduction is likely to involve reactive oxygen species. A new oligoguluronate-inducible vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase (vHPO), specific to iodide was also characterized. The transcription of several vHPO genes was shown to be tightly regulated. * Taken together, our data show that early transcriptional defense responses in L. digitata are similar to those in land plants but also include novel defense responses that involve tightly regulated iodine metabolism.
