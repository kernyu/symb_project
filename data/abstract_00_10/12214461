We outline chemotherapy mainly for malignant ovarian germ cell and sex-cord tumors, based on studies in the literature and our own clinical experiences. With both tumors, PEB treatment is standard adjuvant chemotherapy. With regard to the number of dosage courses, 4 courses are regarded as tolerable after incomplete reduction, and 3 courses as adjuvant treatment after complete extraction. This chemotherapy is effective for preservation of fertility in young patients with malignant ovarian germ cell tumor. In both tumors, some cases show chemotherapy resistance. An effective second-line treatment strategy using a new anticancer agent needs to be established for such cases in the future.
