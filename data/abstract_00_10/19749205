OBJECTIVES: This study focuses on the importance of sterols in the action of miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine, HePC) against Leishmania donovani. METHODS: Plasma membranes of L. donovani promastigotes were depleted of sterol using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MCD) and cholesterol oxidase (CH-OX). Sterols were quantified and HePC susceptibility was assessed using the MTT test. A biomimetic model of the outer leaflet of a Leishmania plasma membrane was used to decipher the HePC-lipid interactions. RESULTS: CH-OX, which is known to act more specifically on condensed membranes, therefore at the level of lipid rafts, gave a better extraction yield in HePC-resistant parasites, confirming the more rigid structure of their membranes than those of wild-type parasites. Sterol depletion was responsible for a 40% decrease in HePC susceptibility in both wild-type and HePC-resistant parasites. Sterol repletion of the sterol-depleted parasites restored HePC susceptibility. The biomimetic model of the outer leaflet of a Leishmania plasma membrane confirmed that condensed microdomains were able to incorporate higher quantities of HePC than fluid ones and this result was amplified when the sterol concentration was increased. CONCLUSIONS: Sterol and lipid rafts probably play a significant role as an HePC reservoir providing a constant supply to the previously described transporter. In addition, (1)H NMR experiments suggested that HePC stimulated lipid trafficking in parasites.
