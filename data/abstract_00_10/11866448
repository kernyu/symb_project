The progress in the use of HAART for the treatment of HIV-infected individuals has been limited by the development of viral resistance and the maintenance of viral latency. New therapeutic strategies geared toward improvement in the host's immune response are now being considered. We found that IFN-gamma induces CIITA through the JAK-STAT pathway and inhibits HIV-1 replication in latently infected cells. Its effect appears to be mediated through the reciprocal action of Tat and CIITA. With this beneficial effect, IFN-gamma and its inducers can be considered as an adjunct to the currently available therapy. We also addressed the safety of using simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, to treat dyslipidemia often associated with the use of protease inhibitors. Simvastatin did not show any unfavorable effects on HIV replication, thus could be used safely unless there are any drug interactions when administered.
