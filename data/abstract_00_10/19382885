BACKGROUND: Pulsatile drug delivery of actives based on the body's biological rhythms came into sight as a novel and emerging concept in the field of drug delivery. The concept of late has given birth to another field of research worth exploring: multiple-pulse drug delivery. OBJECTIVE: Delivering a drug in multiple pulses has been applied to antibiotics for effective and patient compliant drug delivery. Delivering antibiotics in divided pulses results in better annihilation of microbes, as it prevents them going into a resistant/dormant stage and developing biological tolerance. The concept appears to have potential, and on 16 March 2009 MiddleBrook Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will launch the first of such once-daily product based on their proprietary pulsatile drug delivery technology, PULSYS. METHODS: This review focuses on the rationale, possible strategies and technologies employed for multiple-pulse delivery, as well as current status and future trends. CONCLUSION: The concept is in its infancy and promises great potential in the fight against microbial resistance; many approved formulations based on similar approaches with new and improved therapeutic paradigms are anticipated in the near future.
