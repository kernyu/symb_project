Multiple-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) is more difficult to treat and the treatment is less likely to produce favourable results compared to treatment of drug-sensitive disease. Success requires close co-operation between the laboratory, which defines a case as MDRTB, and the clinical team, who will treat it as well as the public health staff who will address aspects of contact tracing and institutional cross-infection. National surveys have indicated that MDRTB occurs at a higher rate in some countries such as Estonia and Latvia (14.1% and 9% respectively, in 1998) and Russia (although there are only limited validated data). In contrast, in Western Europe and in some countries of Eastern Europe, such as the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland with good tuberculosis (TB) prevention and treatment programmes, the combined MDRTB prevalence was 1% or less. The early diagnosis of MDRTB and case management by experienced teams from the outset remains the best hope clinically for these patients. Adequately supervised and prolonged combination chemotherapy is essential, with drug choice governed mainly by quality-controlled in vitro drug susceptibility data. There is a more limited role for surgery, and immunomodulating therapy, such as the use of gamma-interferon, may have a useful adjunct role. Clearly the most important therapeutic modality for MDRTB is to treat drug-sensitive TB correctly in the first instance and prevent the emergence of resistant TB.
