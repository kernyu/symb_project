In order to expand the structure-activity relationship of tetramic acid molecules with structural similarity to the antibiotic reutericyclin, 22 compounds were synthesized and tested against a panel of clinically relevant bacteria. Key structural changes on the tetramic acid core affected antibacterial activity. Various compounds in the N-alkyl 3-acetyltetramic acid series exhibited good activity against Gram-positive bacterial pathogens including Bacillus anthracis, Propionibacterium acnes, Enterococcus faecalis, and both Methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
