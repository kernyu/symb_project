Parasitologic and entomologic cross-sectional surveys were carried out during an outbreak of malaria between December 1998 and August 2000 in forest villages near the Mohkhed Primary Health Center in the Chhindwara District of Madhya Pradesh in central India. In December 1998, surveys showed that more than 70% of the fever cases had malaria, with 87% of the malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The rate of enlarged spleens in children was 74.5%. In November 1999, 58% of the inhabitants were infected with malaria, with 80% of these cases caused by P. falciparum. Chloroquine resistance was seen in 23% of the cases. Anopheles culicifacies was the dominant mosquito species in all surveys (70-85%) and was resistant to DDT. The results indicate that the incidence of malaria in Chhindwara has increased gradually from 0.31 per 1,000 in 1990 to 6.75 per 1,000 in 2000. Improved access to treatment facilities, combination therapy, and vector control using an effective insecticide appear to be the most promising methods for controlling malaria in this region.
