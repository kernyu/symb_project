Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CAMRSA) infection is a clinical problem of increasing global incidence. CAMRSA most commonly presents as abscess and cellulitis of the skin and soft tissue. However, the lesions of cutaneous CAMRSA infection are pleomorphic and may appear as erythematous pustules of superficial folliculitis. This report presents the cases of 2 patients with CAMRSA skin infection that presented as a superficial folliculitis. The distribution of CAMRSA-related, erythematous, folliculocentric pustules was periumbilical, in contrast to the lesional location of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA)-associated folliculitis, which typically appears on the axillae, bearded area, buttocks, and extremities. CAMRSA should be considered in the diagnosis of periumbilical folliculitis or superficial folliculitis arising in areas not typically affected by MSSA-related folliculitis, such as the chest, flanks, and scrotum.
