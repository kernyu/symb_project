BACKGROUND: The 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic called attention to the limited influenza treatment options available, especially in individuals at high risk of severe disease. Neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant seasonal H1N1 viruses have demonstrated the ability to transmit well despite early data indicating that resistance reduces viral fitness. 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses have sporadically appeared containing resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors and the adamantanes, but the ability of these viruses to replicate, transmit, and cause disease in mammalian hosts has not been fully characterized. METHODS: Two pretreatment wild-type viruses and 2 posttreatment multidrug-resistant viruses containing the neuraminidase H275Y mutation collected from immunocompromised patients infected with pandemic influenza H1N1 were tested for viral fitness, pathogenicity, and transmissibility in ferrets. RESULTS: The pretreatment wild-type viruses and posttreatment resistant viruses containing the H275Y mutation all demonstrated significant pathogenicity and equivalent viral fitness and transmissibility. CONCLUSIONS: The admantane-resistant 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus can develop the H275Y change in the neuraminidase gene conferring resistance to both oseltamivir and peramivir without any loss in fitness, transmissibility, or pathogenicity. This suggests that the dissemination of widespread multidrug resistance similar to neuraminidase inhibitor resistance in seasonal H1N1 is a significant threat.
