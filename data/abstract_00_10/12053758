BACKGROUND: Evaluation of antibiotic consumption and the surveillance of bacterial pathogens resistance appears to be an indispensable part of antibiotic policy. The aim of this study was to evaluate dynamics of antibiotics consumption and resistance development in selected bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aueruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) in the environment of Faculty Hospital. METHODS AND RESULTS: The analysis was focused on the development of antibiotic consumption and monitoring of the development of bacterial resistance. Samples were taken in internal and surgical departments of General Faculty Hospital in Prague in 1992, 1995, and 1999. The evaluation of antibiotic consumption was based on Anatomical Therapeutic and Chemical classification system and the Defined Daily Doses (DDD). The consumption in the follow up period almost doubled in surgical department while in internal medicine department was decreased by almost one third. In both department, namely in the surgical one significant increase of bacterial resistance of tested antibiotics was noted. CONCLUSION: The important part of the local antibiotic policy is the monitoring of development of bacterial resistance and consumption of antibiotics.
