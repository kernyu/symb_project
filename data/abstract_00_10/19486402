AIMS: The contribution of dogs and cats as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistant enterococci remains largely undefined. This is increasingly important considering the possibility of transfer of bacteria from companion animals to the human host. In this study, dogs and cats from veterinary clinics were screened for the presence of enterococci. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 420 enterococci were isolated from nasal, teeth, rectal, belly and hindquarters sites of 155 dogs and 121 cats from three clinics in Athens, GA. Eighty per cent (124 out of 155) of the dogs and 60% (72 out of 121) of the cats were positive for enterococci. From the total number of dog samples (n = 275), 32% (n = 87) were from hindquarter, 31% (n = 86) were rectal, and 29% (n = 79) were from the belly area. The majority of isolates originated from rectal samples (53 out of 145; 37%) from cats. The predominant species identified was Enterococcus faecalis (105 out of 155; 68%) from dogs and E. hirae (63 out of 121; 52%) from cats. Significantly more E. faecalis were isolated from rectal samples than any other enterococcal species (P < 0.05) for both dogs and cats suggesting site specific colonization of enterococcal species. The highest levels of resistance were to ciprofloxacin in E. faecium (9 out of 10; 90%), chloramphenicol resistance in E. faecalis (17 out of 20; 85%) and gentamicin resistance in E. faecalis (19 out of 24; 79%) from dog samples and nitrofurantoin resistance in E. faecium (15 out of 19; 79%) from cats. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) (resistance > or =2 antimicrobials) was observed to as few as two and as many as eight antimicrobials regardless of class. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that dogs and cats are commonly colonized with antimicrobial resistant enterococci. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Dogs and cats may act as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance genes that can be transferred from pets to people.
