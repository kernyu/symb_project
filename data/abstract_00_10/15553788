A preparation of lysozyme from a freshwater bivalve, Unio pictorum, has been isolated by sorption to chitin, and its physicochemical properties have been studied. An assessment of the sensitivity of 48 strains of rhodococci, belonging to the species Rhodococcus rubber, R. luteus, and R. erythropolis (Specialized Collection of Alkanotrophic Microorganisms of the Institute of Ecology and Genetics of Microorganisms, Ural Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences), which were isolated from diverse natural waters, to lysozyme of the mollusk Unio pictorum demonstrated that the three species differ in their sensitivity to its effects. The high resistance of rhodococci to lysozyme is indicative of their considerable permanence in hydrobiocenoses (and, therefore, ability to maintain self-purification of microbiocenoses from hydrocarbons).
