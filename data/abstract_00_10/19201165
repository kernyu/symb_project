Enterococcal infections are a common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Vancomycin resistance and the emergence of linezolid resistance necessitate alternative therapies. Studies in vitro as well as animal and case studies suggest that daptomycin may be effective in enterococcal infections. Patients with positive blood cultures for enterococci in the Cubicin((R)) Outcomes Registry and Experience (CORE) 2005-2006 were identified. Patients with endocarditis, intracardiac foreign body infections or non-speciated enterococci were excluded. Outcome was assessed using protocol-defined criteria. Of 159 patients included in the efficacy population, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis were isolated in 120 (75.5%) and 39 (24.5%) patients, respectively. Vancomycin resistance was detected in 91% and 23% of patients with E. faecium and E. faecalis infections, respectively. Prior to daptomycin, 94/159 (59.1%) and 35/159 (22.0%) patients had received vancomycin and linezolid, respectively. Daptomycin was first-line therapy in 27/159 cases (17%). Success was observed in 139/159 patients (87%) and in 104/120 (87%) and 35/39 (90%) patients with E. faecium and E. faecalis infections, respectively. Among the safety population (n=211), 20 (9.5%) experienced 28 adverse events possibly related to daptomycin, 8 of which were considered serious. Daptomycin may be a useful agent for treating enterococcal bacteraemia caused by E. faecium or E. faecalis. Further studies are warranted.
