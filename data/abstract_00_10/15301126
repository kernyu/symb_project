Pseudallescheria boydii is a ubiquitously occurring fungus. While rarely causing opportunistic infection in humans, it is the most common cause of fungal pneumonia in cases of near drowning, and is associated with high mortality. P. boydii typically causes cutaneous mycetomas but may invade the lungs or brain. P. boydii infections are difficult to treat due to amphotericin B resistance and frequent need for surgical resection. Zygomycetous infections, often referred to as "mucormycoses," usually occur in immunocompromised hosts, trauma or burn victims. Like P. boydii, these organisms are found on decaying vegetation and in soil. Zygomycetous infections generally require debridement and prolonged amphotericin B. We report a case of P. boydii pneumonia with a simultaneous brain lesion and cutaneous mucormycosis in a near drowning patient. The pneumonia responded to treatment with voriconazole and the brain lesion resolved without surgery. The cutaneous mucormycosis responded to surgery and amphotericin B. This is the first documented case of simultaneous invasive P. boydii and cutaneous mucormycosis successfully treated with dual systemic antifungal therapy and resection.
