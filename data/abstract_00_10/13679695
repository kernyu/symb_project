OBJECTIVE: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacteria responsible for cutaneous infections. Its capacity to adapt has led to the selection of methicilline-resistant strains (MRSA). These strains create specific problems in their management in dermatology (mode of contamination, treatment, added costs, increased nosocomial risks). The objective of our study was to search for morbidity of MRSA in chronic cutaneous wounds in hospital settings and assess the need of systemic antibiotic therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have conducted a one-year prospective study. All the patients hospitalized in the department with leg ulcers or foot wounds were included. Following local sampling for bacteriological examination, three groups were constituted: methicilline-sensitive patients with staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicilline-resistant staphylococcus aureus patients and patients in whom these bacteria were absent. Only the first two groups were compared after studying the past history, clinical description of the wound at the start of the study, results of the infectious bacteriology and of the clinical and bacteriological evolution of the wounds. RESULTS: The two groups studied were similar in number, past history, clinical aspect and therapeutic management. Only malnutrition was more frequent in patients exhibiting MRSA. There was no difference with the evolution of the wounds. CONCLUSION: Our study did not reveal any difference in the morbidity of staphylococcus aureus in the cutaneous wounds whether methicilline sensitive or resistant. Systematic antibiotherapy is not justified in the absence of signs of infection.
