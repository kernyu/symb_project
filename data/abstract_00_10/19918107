Over nearly two decades, the International HIV Drug Resistance Workshop has become the leading forum for new research on viral resistance to agents developed to treat infection with HIV. The XVIII workshop featured work on HIV type-1 (HIV-1) persistence, reservoirs and elimination strategies; resistance to HIV-1 entry inhibitors (including a comparison of genotyping versus phenotyping to determine HIV-1 coreceptor use before treatment with CCR5 antagonists); polymerase domain resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors (including hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 resistance to lamivudine, and emergence of the K65R mutation in HIV-1 subtypes B and C); connection and RNase H domain resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors (including the effect of mutations in those domains on response to efavirenz and etravirine); resistance to hepatitis C virus and HIV-1 protease inhibitors; resistance to the integrase inhibitor raltegravir; global resistance epidemiology (including models to predict response to second-line antiretrovirals in resource-poor settings); and the role of minority resistant variants (including the effect of such variants on prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1). This report summarizes data from the oral abstract presentations at the workshop.
