The increase in infections caused by resistant Gram-positive organisms has led to an urgent need for new antibiotics. Telavancin is a rapidly bactericidal lipoglycopeptide with multiple mechanisms of action, including concentration-dependent inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis and disruption of the functional integrity of the cell membrane. Telavancin is active against a wide variety of Gram-positive organisms including Staphylococcus aureus with resistance to methicillin, reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and full resistance to vancomycin. Telavacin is approximately 90% protein bound; it has a serum half-life of around 8 h and a prolonged postantibiotic effect, allowing once daily administration. Telavancin is eliminated principally through the urine, requiring dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment. The efficacy and safety of telavancin was demonstrated in a large program of patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. Development of resistance has not been detected in clinical strains. Adverse events include taste disturbance, nausea and vomiting; a small proportion of patients experienced reversible increase in serum creatinine. Two large Phase III studies in patients with healthcare associated pneumonia were recently completed. Telavancin has the potential to become an important therapeutic option to treat serious infections produced by resistant Gram-positive cocci, particularly those caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
