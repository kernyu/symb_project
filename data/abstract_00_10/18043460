We compared outcomes in infants with methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Infants with methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection had a longer median duration of bacteremia (4.5 versus 1 day, P = 0.01), but no difference in length of hospital stay, mortality, or neurodevelopmental impairment.
