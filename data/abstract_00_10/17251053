Oxidative mutation is mainly induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as the superoxide anion radical (O(2)(-)) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). However, in Escherichia coli (E. coli), ROS are eliminated by enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, which are coded by sodAB and katEG genes. In this study, to detect mutagens that induce oxidative mutation, a mutant (WP2katEGsodAB) with katEG and sodAB deleted was constructed by gene manipulation of E. coli WP2. H(2)O(2) and menadione sodium bisulfite generated mutation in WP2katEGsodAB but not in WP2. o-Phenylphenol (OPP) and its metabolites (phenylhydroquinone (PHQ) and phenyl-1,4-benzoquinone (PBQ)), which had been shown to be negative in the Ames test but reported to be carcinogenic, induced mutation in WP2katEGsodAB but not in WP2. These results suggest that the new assay may be useful for the detection of oxidative mutagens.
