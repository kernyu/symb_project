In Argentina, studies on Varroa destructor resistance to coumaphos are still unknown. At present, high infestation levels of V. destructor are being detected in colonies of Apis mellifera after treatment with this acaricide. The aim of the present study was to determine the LC50 of coumaphos in V. destructor from four apiaries with high mite density after treatment with coumaphos. The LC50's were 112, 319, 127 and 133 microg/Petri dish for mites from the four apiaries. Significant LC50 differences were detected between resistant and susceptible mites. LC50 increased 197-559-fold when compared to the corresponding baseline, suggesting the development of resistance. These results are the first report of resistance to coumaphos in V. destructor in Argentina.
