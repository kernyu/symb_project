Cecal contents (16 samples/each flock) of broilers derived from 212 flocks were investigated for colonization of Campylobacter from 1995 to 1999 in the southern part of Japan, and the isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibilities. C. jejuni-positive flocks numbered 42 (19.8%) and C. coli-positive ones 26 (12.3%); Campylobacter spp. were recovered from 68 flocks (32.1%) in total. MICs of ampicillin, erythromycin (EM), tetracycline, nalidixic acid (NA), norfloxacin (NFLX), and ofloxacin (OFLX) to these 68 Campylobacter isolates were determined. Quinolone-resistant Campylobacter isolates numbered 22 (32.4%). All the isolates except one were cross-resistant to NA, OFLX, and NFLX. A high frequency of quinolone-resistance was found in both C. jejuni and C. coli, whereas a high level of EM-resistance was found in only C. coli strains. All C. jejuni isolates were sensitive to EM.
