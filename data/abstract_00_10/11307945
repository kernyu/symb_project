A total of 90 strains of Staphylococcus intermedius isolated from dogs were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility. There were no significant differences in the distribution patterns of MICs between strains from 1982 to 1985 and those from 1999, and between strains from healthy dogs and those from diseased dogs. All of the strains were susceptible to ABPC, DMPPC, CEX, TDM, ERFX, BFLX, and FF at concentrations of 0.05 to 6.25 microg/ml. The MICs of OTC, KM, EM, AIV-TS, and LCM were distributed in a broad range of 0.1 to >100 microg/ml, indicating the existence of resistant as well as susceptible populations of S. intermedius. Thirty-three strains (36.7%) were resistant to one or more anitmicrobial agents such as OTC (n=32), KM (n=9), EM (n=7), AIV-TS (n=7), and LCM (n=7).
