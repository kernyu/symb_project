Staphylococcus aureus remains an important human pathogen affecting both outpatients and those hospitalized. Increasing antimicrobial resistance is global but prevalence rates are variable for different geographical areas. Fluoroquinolones have been used to treat S. aureus infections and the newer quinolones have enhanced in vitro activity against this organism. The mutant prevention concentration (MPC) defines the antimicrobial drug concentration threshold that would require an organism to simultaneously possess two mutations for growth in the presence of the drug. We tested clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) S. aureus by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and MPC against gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. For MSSA strains, the rank order of potency based on MIC(90) values were gemifloxacin (0.063 mg/l) = moxifloxacin (0.063 mg/l) > gatifloxacin (0.05 mg/l) = levofloxacin (0.25 mg/l) and by MPC values moxifloxacin (0.25 mg/l) > gemifloxacin (0.5 mg/l) > gatifloxacin (1 mg/l) = levofloxacin (1mg/l). For 87% of the isolates the MPC value was 0.5 mg/l for gatifloxacin. The rank order of potency based on the time the serum drug concentration exceeded the MPC(90), was as follows: moxifloxacin (>24 h) > levofloxacin (>18 h) > gatifloxacin (12 h) > gemifloxacin (9 h). Serum drug concentration remained in excess of the MPC(87) for 24 h for gatifloxacin. Both MIC(90) and MPC(90) values were higher against MRSA strains and the time above the MPC(90) was significantly shorter for all agents.
