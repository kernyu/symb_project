Respiratory infections are the most frequent reason for primary health care consultation. The main causes of respiratory tract infections in children are viruses and the most common types are upper respiratory tract infections: common cold, pharyngitis, otitis media and sinusitis. Pneumonia is much more serious. As well as viruses, bacteria are often involved in respiratory tract infections. Three bacterial species are most commonly isolated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. The most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis is Streptococcus pyogenes. Bacteria isolated from community-acquired infection usually are sensitive to the majority of suitable drugs, but during the past two decades, significant antibiotic resistance has emerged. Resistance to penicillins has spread among H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. The mechanism of penicillin resistance in H. influenzae is mainly by production of beta-lactamases TEM-1 and ROB-1, whereas in S. pneumoniae resistance is an effect of the changes in penicillin binding proteins. Among respiratory pathogens, resistance to tetracyclines, macrolides, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones has also appeared. Several mechanisms depending on changes in target, active efflux and modifying enzymes are involved.
