SETTING: Penitentiary system of Georgia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of resistance to second-line drugs among prisoners with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of resistance to second-line drugs in tuberculosis (TB) patients treated from 2001 to 2003. RESULTS: The overall observed prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was 14.4% (39/270). The lowest resistance was found for ofloxacin (OFX), which was 2.2% (6/270) overall and 5.1% (2/39) among MDR patients. Isolates from four non-MDR patients who had never received anti-tuberculosis treatment were found to be resistant to OFX. Resistance to kanamycin and capreomycin occurred simultaneously only among MDR patients and was observed in 17/39 cases (43.6%). High rates of resistance to > or =2 second-line drugs (18/39, 46.2%) and > or =3 second-line drugs (10/39, 25.6%) were observed among all MDR-TB patients, reaching respectively 59.3% and 29.6% among previously treated MDR-TB cases. Only one patient was found to be resistant to four second-line drugs. No extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) according to the latest definition was detected. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal a serious threat to the TB control efforts in the study population.
