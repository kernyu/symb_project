A structure-activity relationship (SAR) study on 5-substituted oxazolidinones as an antibacterial agent is described. The oxazolidinones, of which 5-acetylaminomethyl moiety was converted into other functions, were prepared and evaluated for antibacterial activity. Elongation of the methylene chain (8) and conversion of the acetamido moiety into guanidino moiety (12) decreased the antibacterial activity. The replacement of carbonyl oxygen (=O) by thiocarbonyl sulfur (=S) enhanced in vitro antibacterial activity. Especially, compound 16, which had the 5-thiourea group, showed 4-8 stronger in vitro activity than linezolid. Our SAR study revealed that the antibacterial activity was greatly affected by the conversion of 5-substituent.
