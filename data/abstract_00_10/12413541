Clavulanic acid is only a modestly effective antibiotic against bacterial infections in humans, but a potent inhibitor/inactivator of beta-lactamase enzymes that confer bacterial resistance. The biosynthetic pathway to clavulanic acid is considerably more complex than that to the structurally related penicillins and cephalosporins and has revealed several interesting reactions.
