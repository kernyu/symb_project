The frequency of isolation and antifungal susceptibility patterns to established and two new antifungal agents were determined for 218 Candida spp isolates causing bloodstream infection from 1996 to 2001. Overall, 41.7% of the candidemias were due to C. albicans, followed by C. parapsilosis (22%), C. tropicalis (16.1%), C. glabrata (11.9%), C. krusei (6%) and miscellaneous Candida spp (2.3%). Isolates of C. albicans C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis (80% of isolates) were highly susceptible to fluconazole (94 to 100% at </= 8 microg/ml) and voriconazole (97 to 100% at </= 1 microg/ml). By comparison with the newer agents itraconazole was less active (77 to 97% at </=0.12 microg/ml). Only 77% and 15% of C. glabrata isolates were inhibited by fluconazole at </= 8 microg/ml and itraconazole at </=0.12 microg/ml, respectively. Voriconazole showed a remarkable in vitro potency against C. glabrata as well as C. krusei isolates (100% at </= 1 microg/ml). Anidulafungin was very active against Candida spp isolates (MIC90: </= 0.5 microg/ml), except C. parapsilosis (MIC90: 4 microg/ml) and two C. guilliermondii isolates (MIC: >/= 32 microg/ml).
