Recent evidence indicates that the slowly expanding population of CD5+ B cells that characterizes chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) results primarily from defects in responses to cytokines that regulate apoptosis (e.g. I1-4, TGF-beta, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma). We have now demonstrated not only that the enhanced anti-apoptotic effect of IFN-gamma on these neoplastic B cells is apparently mediated through increased levels of IFN-gamma receptors but also that there are increased numbers of IFN-gamma-expressing CD4 and CD8 T cells in these patients. This is the strongest evidence to date that multiple alterations in the IFN-gamma cytokine network contribute to the pathogenesis of CLL.
