Abstract The activity of raltegravir and etravirine was assessed in vitro in HIV-1 group O isolates. Despite the presence of some natural polymorphisms associated with resistance to raltegravir (V72I, L74I, S153A, V201I, and T206S) and etravirine (G190A), both drugs showed significant antiviral activity. Subsequently, the clinical benefit was shown in an HIV-1 group O-infected individual in whom enfuvirtide was replaced by raltegravir. Therefore, individuals infected with HIV-1 group O might benefit from raltegravir and/or etravirine therapy.
