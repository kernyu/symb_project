The purpose of this study was to investigate the genetic similarity of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli with similar antimicrobial resistance phenotypes, isolated from cattle on different farms and at different times, in order to evaluate the possible existence of disseminated antimicrobial resistant clones. PFGE after SmaI and KpnI restriction identified 23 and 16 distinct PFGE patterns among 29 C. jejuni and 66 C. coli isolates, respectively. In C. coli, 51 (77%) of the resistant isolates demonstrated one of the four indistinguishable PFGE patterns, whereas only 24% doxycycline resistant C. jejuni shared one of the two indistinguishable PFGE patterns. The genetic mechanisms of resistance were homogeneous within and between these clonal types. Genetically indistinguishable (clonal) groups of C. coli accounted for most Campylobacter sp. with multiple antimicrobial resistance observed in this study, consistent with a role for clonal dissemination in the epidemiology of resistance in this species.
