The 3435C-->T polymorphism at the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) was examined in 74 patients with human immunodeficiency virus who initiated atazanavir therapy. The MDR1 genotype distribution at position 3435 was 28% CC, 45% CT, and 27% TT. Plasma levels of atazanavir were significantly higher in patients with genotype CC than in those with CT or TT, and bilirubin levels correlated with atazanavir concentrations.
