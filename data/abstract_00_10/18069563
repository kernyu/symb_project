OBJECTIVE: To establish a rapid method for testing drug sussceptibility on Mycobacterium tuberculosis. METHODS: Taking absolute Concentration method for drug susceptibility testing of M. tuberculosis as the "gold standard", we examined the drug-resistant of M. tuberculosis strain with nitrate reducrase assay (NRA) and the drug-resistant of M. tuberculosis germ in sputum with NRA. RESULTS: NRA and absolute concentration method was basically comparable with NRA susceptibility as 96.5% and the specificity was 100%, When comparing with traditional absolute concentration method, NRA could shorten the time about 3 weeks. Using NRA to test the drug-resistant of M. tuberculosis germ in sputum, its susceptibility was more than 66.7% and specificity was 100%, within 10-20 days. CONCLUSION: NRA could be used as a rapid drug susceptibility testing on M. tuberculosis.
