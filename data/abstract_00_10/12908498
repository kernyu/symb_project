Acute otitis media is defined as eardrum inflammation associated with middle-ear effusion and acute signs and symptoms. Viruses are the primary pathogens, and bacterial superinfection is common. Pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae are the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens. Recovery is usually rapid, though somewhat slower in children under 2 years of age. The only benefits of antibacterial chemotherapy are a marginal reduction in the duration of pain and use of analgesics. Antibacterial therapy has no effect on the risk of relapse, medium term auditory outcome in children, or complications. It does, however, increase the risk of becoming a carrier of resistant strains
