Escherichia coli isolates from calves were investigated by multiplex PCR assays for the presence of genes encoding K99, F41, F17-related fimbriae, heat-stabile enterotoxin a (STa), intimin (eae) and Shiga toxins (stx1 and stx2). A total of 120 E. coli isolates, 75 isolated from diarrhoeic or septicemic calves and 45 from clinically healthy calves aged between 1 day and 2 months were tested. Each isolate was obtained from different calves in different herds. Among the isolates from diseased animals, 12 (16%) isolates from 1- to 7-day-old diarrhoeic calves were detected as enterotoxigenic E. coli which possessed K99, F41 and STa in combination; F17-related fimbriae genes were detected in 33 (44%) isolates and they were found in combination with K99 + F41 + STa in two isolates. Of 120 isolates, 16 carried eae, eight stx1 and five stx2 genes alone or in combination. None of the eae- or stx-positive strains was identified as O157:H7. However, results indicate that calves may be carrier of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli which have potential as a human pathogen. Antimicrobial susceptibility of 75 isolates from diseased calves was determined by agar disk diffusion method for 14 antimicrobial agents. In 77.3% of the isolates, multiresistance was detected. Higher resistance rates were detected for cephalothin (72%), tetracycline (69.3%), kanamycin (69.3%), ampicillin (65.3%), nalidixic acid (53.3%), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (52%) and enrofloxacin (41.3%), respectively. No resistance was found for ceftiofur and cefoxitin.
