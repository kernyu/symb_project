Some chemical and fungicidal effects of 20 phthalocyanines of Co, Fe, Cu, and Al were studied. Under dark conditions, these complexes reduced nitroblue tetrazolium in the presence of KCN, accelerated the autoxidation of ascorbate or hydroquinone and decomposed hydrogen peroxide. In the later reaction, hydroxyl radical was generated as evidenced with the deoxyribose assay. The inhibition by superoxide dismutase and catalase of catalyzed autoxidation of ascorbate suggests the participation of superoxide anion-radical and hydrogen peroxide in the reaction. Most complexes were toxic to the fungus Magnaporthe grisea which causes blast disease of rice. The toxicity was enhanced by light being diminished by antioxidant reagents sequestering active oxygen species. Some complexes (including nontoxic ones), after 1-day contact with a leaf surface of the disease-susceptible rice cultivar, induced the fungitoxicity of leaf diffusate. This toxicity was also light-activated and sensitive to antioxidant reagents. Several complexes, when added to inocula, decreased 2-3 times the frequency of the compatible symptoms of the blast. It is suggested that in planta, the dark redox activity of phthalocyanines along with their photosensitization promote the generation of active oxygen, which damages the parasite and, therefore, favors disease resistance.
