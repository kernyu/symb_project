The appearance of multidrug-resistant (MDR) proteins or the acquisition of a defective apoptotic programme are major drawbacks in the treatment of cancers since both induce a resistance to classical chemotherapy. However, a link between the two mechanisms has not, as yet, been clearly established. In this study, HL-60 cells cultured in the continual presence of a sub-lethal dose of doxorubicin (dox; HL-60/Dox) were used as a model to study acquired chemoresistance. During the induction of chemoresistance, the appearance of a functional P-glycoprotein (P-gp), in addition to the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and pro-apoptotic Bax proteins was assessed. Parental cells which are sensitive to dox, have no P-gp activity and express Bcl-2 and Bax. After 4 weeks of treatment, a functional P-gp was detected in HL-60/Dox cells. In addition, the synthesis of Bcl-2 appeared to be replaced by Bcl-XL while that of Bax remained unchanged. These cells were also resistant to apoptosis induced by both P-gp and non-P-gp substrates. This inability to induce apoptosis could have resulted from the induction of the expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). Our data show that acquired chemoresistance could involve a parallel induction of P-gp and an impairment of the apoptotic pathway.
