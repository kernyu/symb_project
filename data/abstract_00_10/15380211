3-(N-Benzylcarbamoyl)-7-carboxy-3, 4-dihydro-2H-1-benzo-pyran-2-one and its 8-carboxy analogue have been synthesized and evaluated as potential (inhibitory) substrates of beta-lactam-recognizing enzymes. These compounds are bicyclic delta-lactones with retro-amide (with respect to classical beta-lactams) side chains. They were found to be comparably effective as substrates of typical class A, C and D beta-lactamases as analogous benzopyranones bearing 'normal' amide side chains. The new 8-carboxy derivative, however, formed a much more (1000-fold) tightly-bound acyl-enzyme with a class C beta-lactamase than did its 'normal' analogue, and thus provides a structural lead to new inhibitors of this class of beta-lactamase.
