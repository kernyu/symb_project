The multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica serotype Newport strain that produces CMY-2 beta-lactamase (Newport MDR-AmpC) was the source of sporadic cases and outbreaks in humans in France during 2000-2005. Because this strain was not detected in food animals, it was most likely introduced into France through imported food products.
