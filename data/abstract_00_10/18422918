Chronic, widespread and invasive cutaneous dermatophytoses due to Trichopyhton rubrum are common in immunocompromised patients. In immunocompetent individuals, however, chronic widespread dermatophytoses are more often associated with onychomycosis and tinea pedis. We describe a 54-year-old immunocompetent female who presented with a 2-year history of extensive erythematous and hyper-pigmented scaly plaques involving the abdominal, gluteal and crural regions without concomitant tinea pedis, tinea manus or onychomycosis. The diagnosis was made by mycological examination including culture. The pathogen identified was T. rubrum. The patient had a history of resistance to systemic fluconazole and topical ketoconazole. After an 8-week therapy period with systemic itraconazole and sertaconazole nitrate cream, a near-complete clearing of all lesions was observed. Trichophyton rubrum may thus present atypical aspects in immmunocompetent patients.
