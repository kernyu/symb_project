It is well known that human alpha-defensin-1, also designated as human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP1), is a potent inhibitor towards several enveloped virus infecting mammals. In this report, we analyzed the mechanism of the antiviral action of this antimicrobial peptide (AMP) on viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), a salmonid rhabdovirus. Against VHSV, synthetic HNP1 possesses two antiviral activities. The inactivation of VHSV particles probably through interfering with VHSV-G protein-dependent fusion and the inhibition of VHSV replication in target cells by up-regulating genes related to the type I interferon (IFN) response, such as Mx. Neither induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) by HNP1 nor their antiviral activity against fish rhabovirus has been previously reported. Therefore, we can conclude that besides to acting as direct effector, HNP1 acts across species and can elicit one of the strongest antiviral responses mediated by innate immune system. Since the application of vaccine-based immunization strategies is very limited, the used of chemicals is restricted because of their potential harmful impact on the environment and no antimicrobial peptides from fish that exhibit both antiviral and immunoenhancing capabilities have been described so far, HNP1 could be a model molecule for the development of antiviral agents for fish. In addition, these results further confirm that molecules that mediate the innate resistance of animals to virus may prove useful as templates for new antivirals in both human and animal health.
