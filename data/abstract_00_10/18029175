A series of nucleoside phosphonate reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors have been synthesized and their anti-HIV activity and resistance profiles evaluated. The most potent analog [5-(6-amino-purin-9-yl)-2,5-dihydro-furan-2-yloxymethyl]-phosphonic acid (d4AP) demonstrated a HIV EC(50)=2.1 microM, and the most favorable resistance profile against HIV-1 variants with K65R, M184V or multiple thymidine analog mutations in RT.
