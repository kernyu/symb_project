OBJECTIVE: Children with HIV infection are particularly susceptible to invasive pneumococcal disease, yet the effect of HIV infection and its medical management on colonization and resistance to antibiotics are poorly described. To provide a basis for medical practice, we determined the prevalence of nasopharyngeal colonization and antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae in children with HIV infection. METHODS: Cross-sectional prevalence sample of children attending the pediatric HIV and pulmonary clinics to examine nasopharyngeal colonization with S. pneumoniae and antibiotic resistance to beta-lactams and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (T/S). Subjects were matched by age and date of clinic visit. RESULTS: The colonization rate with S. pneumoniae of HIV-infected and -indeterminate children was equal to that of controls (20% vs. 19%). HIV infection, CDC staging or receipt of oral antibiotic therapy did not affect colonization. Isolates from HIV-infected and -indeterminate children were less likely to be penicillin-resistant than those from controls (18% vs. 50%). There was no difference in pneumococcal resistance to T/S among isolates from subjects and controls, despite 72% T/S use in the HIV clinic. CONCLUSION: Colonization with S. pneumoniae in HIV disease is no different from that of comparable children. The high incidence of pneumococcal disease and prophylaxis with T/S are not related to nasopharyngeal colonization. Antibiotic prophylaxis of HIV-infected children does not necessarily lead to increased resistance of S. pneumoniae.
