PURPOSE: The mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and other advantages and disadvantages of ganciclovir and valganciclovir are discussed. SUMMARY: Shortcomings of oral ganciclovir include low bioavailability, large pill burden, patient nonadherence, and the emergence of resistance. Valganciclovir, an oral prodrug of ganciclovir, has a nearly tenfold greater absolute bioavailability than ganciclovir. Dosage adjustment is required for both drugs in patients with renal impairment. CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetic profile of valganciclovir offers significant advantages for its use in cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis.
