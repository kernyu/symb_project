BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) are an effective strategy to ensure that antibiotics are used in accordance with scientific evidence to improve patient outcome, minimize antimicrobial (AM) resistance, and reduce hospital costs. The article describes the impact of the implementation of an ASP on AM prescription errors. METHODS: Prospective, single-center study performed at a tertiary pediatric teaching hospital that actively monitored 13 targeted AMs (amikacin, amphotericin B, cefepime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, levofloxacin, linezolid, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, tobramycin, vancomycin, and voriconazole) and microbiology data. The ASP was implemented using CareNet and PharmNet. An infectious disease physician and pharmacist determined the need for intervention. RESULTS: The authors screened 5564 dispensed prescriptions of the 13 targeted AMs. The rate of AM errors associated with these was 0.09/1000 doses administered and 5 errors/1000 patient days. CONCLUSIONS: Active surveillance and optimization of computerized physician order entry system allows early detection and intervention of AMs prescriptions errors in hospitalized children.
