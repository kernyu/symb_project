Conventional microbiological diagnosis of fungal infections and parasitic diseases has been characterized by low diagnostic sensitivity, laboriousness, and the need for expert microscopists. Consequently, diagnostic methods based on the detection of nucleic acids are a magnificent alternative to overcome these problems, but have not yet provided a satisfactory response in all situations. The molecular methods used are varied and most are based on techniques of nucleic acid amplification. These techniques have proved useful for mycological and parasitological diagnosis, for epidemiological and taxonomic studies, and for monitoring the response to different treatments and detection of resistance. The introduction of these techniques in developing countries may be hampered by their higher cost but molecular diagnostic methods are already beginning to spread in clinical microbiology laboratories and are competing successfully with traditional methods. The present article reviews the current status of molecular methods in the diagnosis of fungal and parasitic infections.
