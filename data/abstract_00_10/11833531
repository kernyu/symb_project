Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic produced by Actinoplanes teichomyceticus. A strain improvement to increase the productivity of the major component, teicoplanin A2-2, was carried out. As the fatty moiety of teicoplanin A2-2 is derived from L-valine, L-valine analogue (valine hydroxamate)-resistant mutants were derived. One of the mutants, 98-1-227, overproduced valine and produced a higher titer of total teicoplanin with higher A2-2 content. In a pilot fermentor (7 m3), the total productivity of teicoplanin was 1,800 units/ml and the A2-2 content was 58%.
