A potential epidemic clone of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium DT104, and the possible emergence of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium DT104b, has been identified from the characterization of 67 S. enterica serotype Typhimurium strains from three sources, human gastroenteritis isolates, isolates from food samples, and veterinary isolates, by antimicrobial resistance profiling, phage typing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline was found in 77.6% of these strains.
