Corollosporine isolated from the marine fungus Corollospora maritima and N-analogous corollosporines are antimicrobial substances. Owing to the basic structure of the N-analogous corollosporines, they have become an attractive target for laccase-catalyzed derivatisation. In this regard we report on the straightforward laccase-catalyzed amination of dihydroxylated arenes with N-analogous corollosporines. In biological assays the obtained amination products are more active than the parent compounds.
