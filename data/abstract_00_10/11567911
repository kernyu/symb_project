Therapeutic innovation in oncology often requires the optimization of combinations with active drugs based on in vitro and in vivo data. This is exemplified by oxaliplatin for which several preclinical studies of combinations have been realized. Oxaliplatin has been combined with 5-fluoro-uracile, gemcitabine, topoisomerase I inhibitors, taxanes demonstrating synergy or additivity. Synergistic and additive effects are often due to the optimization in the use of distinct mechanism of action or resistance and might be associated with no overlapping toxicity when combined in clinical trials.
