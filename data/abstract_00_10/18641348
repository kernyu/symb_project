Type I IFNs (IFNIs) have pleiotropic functions in regulating host innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogens. To elucidate the role of IFNIs in host resistance to chlamydial infection in vivo, we compared IFN-alpha/beta receptor knockout (IFNAR(-/-)) and wild-type control mice in susceptibility to Chlamydia trachomatis mouse pneumonitis (Chlamydia muridarum) lung infection. We found that the IFNAR(-/-) mice were significantly more resistant to C. muridarum infection showing less bacterial burden and bodyweight loss, and milder pathological changes. However, IFN-gamma response, which is believed to be critical in host defense against chlamydial infection, was similar between the wild-type and IFNAR(-/-) mice. More importantly, TUNEL analysis showed less macrophage apoptosis in IFNAR(-/-) mice, which was consistent with lower expressions of IFNI-induced apoptotic factors, TRAIL, Daxx, and PKR. Furthermore, depletion of lung macrophages with dichloromethylene diphosphonate-liposome significantly increased the susceptibility of the IFNAR(-/-) mice to C. muridarum, confirming the importance of macrophages. Overall, the data indicate that IFNIs play a promoting role in C. muridarum lung infection, largely through increase of local macrophage apoptosis.
