A few months ago, I evaluated an interesting thesis by Vilhjalmur Ari Arason of Iceland with the title: "Use of antimicrobials and carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci in children: Repeated cross-sectional studies covering 10 years." (Available at http://landspitali.openrepository.com/lsh/handle/2336/6005). The results of the thesis deserve further dissemination because we can all learn a great deal about the relationship between use of antibiotics and bacteria susceptability in the community.
