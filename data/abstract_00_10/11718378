Candida dubliniensis ia an opportunistic pathogen mainly associated with oral candidiasis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. We recently recovered the first Italian clinical isolates of C. dubliniensis from the oral cavities of seven HIV-seropositive subjects. The in vitro susceptibility to fluconazole (FLCZ) of these isolates was determined according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) M27-A broth microdilution method for yeasts. All seven isolates of C. dubliniensis were susceptible to FLCZ (MICs < or =0.5 microg/ml). Results of this reference method were compared to those obtained with simplified tests, more adapted to routine evaluation in hospital laboratories. Fungitest and Sensititre YeastOne colorimetric microplate-based methods have been evaluated. The agar disk diffusion method has also been tested on two different media: RPMI 1640-2% glucose and High Resolution-2% glucose-0.5 microg/ml methylene blue. All of the simplified methods tested were able to correctly identify FLCZ-susceptibility of this group of Italian C. dubliniensis isolates.
