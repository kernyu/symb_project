Biological activities, priming and protective effects of two oligogalacturonides fractions (OGAs) were assayed during a compatible wheat/Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici interaction. These fractions were obtained from commercial polygalacturonic acid. They both consisted of oligogalacturonides with polymerisation degrees (DP) ranging from 2 to 25, and one of them was a 30% chemically acetylated fraction. A 5 g x L(-1) solution of each fraction was infiltrated in the first leave of ten-days-old plantlets, and activities of defence-related enzymes were measured 48H post-treatment. Among them, oxalate oxidase and peroxidase activities increased, suggesting an elicitation due to both fractions of oligogalacturonides. Some of the pre-treated plantlets were subsequently submitted to powdery mildew infection. As revealed by 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining, the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at the penetration site of the fungus increased 21H after inoculation to the same extent in areas of plantlets infiltrated by both fractions. On the other hand, the intensity of fluorescence associated with papillae was higher when plantlets were pre-infiltrated with the acetylated fraction, whereas no difference was observed between control plantlets and those treated with the non-acetylated fraction. Moreover, microscopic assessment of the number of haustoria occurring 40H post-inoculation showed it was only reduced when acetylated fraction was used. Despite different modes of action of these molecules, a similar 45% protective effect occurred in both cases when the oligogalacturonides fractions were sprayed on ten-days-old plantlets.
