A total of 100 HIV sero-positive patients with oral lesion/lesions suggestive of oropharyngeal candidiasis were studied. Candida species were isolated from 61 patients. Out of 61 isolates, 43 (70.49%) isolates were of Candida albicans and 18 (29.50%) isolates were of non albicans species. Out of 43 isolates, 2 (4.65%) isolates of Candida albicans and out of 18 isolates, 4 (22.2%) isolates of non albicans species were found to be fluconazole resistant. No resistance was observed against amphotericin B and ketoconazole.
