The molecular attributes of the first ESBL producing isolate 267/99 of Salmonella enterica serovar Mbandaka isolated in 1999 in Poland were characterised. Tested strain produced CTX-M-3 and TEM-1 beta-lactamases, encoded by genes localised on the about 80 kb self-transferable plasmid, harbouring the 2 kb class 1 integron carrying aadA2 gene.
