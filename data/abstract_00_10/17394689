OBJECTIVE: To document the prevalence of resistance to various agents of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains derived from children over 1994-2004. DESIGN: We prospectively studied the susceptibility patterns of 77 strains of M. tuberculosis isolated from the same number of children, which provided 112 positive samples. RESULTS: Most children were boys (53.2%), native Greeks (87%) and aged under 2 years (41.5%). Sample origin was mainly gastric fluid (97 cases, 86.6%). Sixty-one isolates (79.2%) were susceptible to all anti-tuberculosis agents and 16 (20.8%) were resistant to > or =1 drug. Multidrug resistance (MDR), resistance to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP), was seen in three cases (3.9%). On comparing resistance to INH, RMP and streptomycin (SM) and MDR in children and adults diagnosed with tuberculosis in our centre during the same time period, SM resistance was significantly more common in children (P < 0.001), while a trend for increased resistance to INH was also observed in children (P = 0.079). CONCLUSION: Resistance of M. tuberculosis isolates to the first line anti-tuberculosis drugs appears to be comparable in children and adults in Greece, while SM resistance appears to be more common in children. Tracing the sources of these children is important for the effective surveillance and treatment of tuberculosis.
