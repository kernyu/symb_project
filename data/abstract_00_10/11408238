This investigation explored pharmacodynamic characteristics of fluoroquinolones against Bacteroides thetaiotamicron and the potential for development of resistance. An in vitro model was used to generate kill curves with three fluoroquinolones at various area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/MIC ratios. Concentration-independent killing was observed. Increases in MICs were noted following exposure to fluoroquinolones at AUC/MIC ratios of 6 to 14.
