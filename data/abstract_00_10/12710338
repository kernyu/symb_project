1567 clinical samples were obtained for the study; 494 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated (isolation rate of 31.52) and their antibiotic sensitivity patterns tested using Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method. The antibiotic sensitivity testing revealed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were highly resistant to most anti-pseudomonal antibiotics; Amikacin was found to be most suitable for routine use with a sensitivity of 68.01% and the most resistant antibiotic was Netilmicin showing 70.04% resistance. Surprisingly, Gentamycin showed a relatively higher sensitivity of 55.87%. Sensitivity to Imipenem and Meropenem was 100%.
