The present study examines the effect of chronic administration of dealcoholized red wine Malbec (DRW) on vascular remodeling and NAD(P)H oxidase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity (eNOS) in an experimental model of metabolic syndrome induced by fructose administration. Thirty-day old male Wistar rats were fed a normal rat diet (control) or the same diet plus 10% fructose in drinking water (FFR). During the last 4 weeks of a 10-week period of the corresponding diet, a subgroup of control and FFR (n=8 each) received DRW in their drinking water. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), aortic NAD(P)H oxidase and eNOS activity in the heart and vascular tissue were evaluated. Vascular remodeling was evaluated in the left carotid artery (CA) and interlobar, arcuate and interlobular renal arteries (RA) through lumen to media (L/M) ratio determination. At the end of the study FFR increased the SBP (p < 0.001), HOMA-IR (p < 0.001), and aortic NAD(P)H oxidase activity (p < 0,05) but reduced cardiac and vascular eNOS activity (p < 0.01), L/M ratio in CA (p < 0.001) and RA (p < 0.01) compared with the C group. DRW reduced SBP (p < 0.05), aortic NAD(P)H oxidase (p < 0.05), and recovered eNOS activity (p < 0.001) and L/M in CA (p < 0.001) and RA (p < 0.001) compared with FFR. This study provides new data about the beneficial effect of DRW on oxidative stress and vascular remodeling in the experimental model of metabolic syndrome. Data suggest the participation of mechanisms involving oxidative stress in FFR alterations and the usefulness of natural antioxidant substances present in red wine in the reversion of these changes.
