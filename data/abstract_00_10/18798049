Only a handful of cases of human Candida lambica infections have been published up to now. We report a Candida lambica fungemia in a young intravenous drug abuser. Using a popular chromogenic agar and a commercial phenotyping gallery, the fungus was initially misidentified as Candida krusei. Key tests to distinguish these closely related species are maximum growth temperature and assimilation of certain substrates present in more elaborate phenotyping assays. Definite confirmation is possible using molecular techniques. Susceptibility testing of the isolate demonstrated amphotericin B (MIC 0.125 microg/ml) susceptible, flucytosine (MIC 2 microg/ml) susceptible, itraconazole (MIC 0.064 microg/ml) susceptible, voriconazole (MIC 1 microg/ml) susceptible, and fluconazole (MIC >64 microg/ml, resistant).
