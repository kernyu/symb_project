We examine the dynamics of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as therapies that minimize viral load, restore adaptive immunity, and use minimal dosage of anti-HIV drugs. Virtual therapies for wild-type infections are demonstrated; however, the HIV infection is never cured, requiring continued treatment to keep the condition in remission. With high viral turnover and mutation rates, drug-resistant strains of HIV evolve quickly. The ability of optimal therapy to contain drug-resistant strains is shown to depend upon the relative fitness of mutant strains.
