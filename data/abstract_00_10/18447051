Malaria remains a major public health problem, both for travellers and for the 40,000 French soldiers deployed each year to endemic areas. Epidemiological data show that imported malaria (IM) is on the increase, and that migrants account for more than 60% of malaria cases notified each year in France. The increase in IM among French military personnel is explained by prematurely terminated chemoprophylaxis on return, repeated short missions, and more cases of P. vivax and P. ovale infection. The choice of chemoprophylaxis depends mainly on the level of chloroquine resistance in the country visited. The atovaquone-proguanil combination is well tolerated and only requires 7 days of intake on return from the endemic area. Doxycycline monohydrate is cheaper and better-tolerated than mefloquine, and is thus preferred for French military personnel. However, its short half-life necessitates very good compliance. Chemoprophylaxis should be combined with vector control measures and with personal protection (impregnated bednets, protective clothing, repellents, and indoor insecticide spraying). The need for these measures should be clearly explained before departure, during the stay, and after return.
