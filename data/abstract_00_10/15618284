OBJECTIVES: The antifungal drug susceptibilities of 351 isolates of Candida species, obtained through active laboratory-based surveillance in the period January 2002-December 2003, were determined (Candida albicans 51%, Candida parapsilosis 23%, Candida tropicalis 10%, Candida glabrata 9%, Candida krusei 4%). METHODS: The MICs of amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and caspofungin were established by means of the broth microdilution reference procedure of the European Committee on Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin B and flucytosine were active in vitro against all strains. A total of 24 isolates (6.8%) showed decreased susceptibility to fluconazole (MIC > or = 16 mg/L) and 43 (12.3%) showed decreased susceptibility to itraconazole (MIC > or = 0.25 mg/L). Voriconazole and caspofungin were active in vitro against the majority of isolates, even those that were resistant to fluconazole.
