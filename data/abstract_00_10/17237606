Eleven broiler isolates of Salmonella Infantis obtained between 1989 and 1998 were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. Seven strains of S. Infantis isolated after 1993 harbored similar antimicrobial susceptibilities to the recent isolates between 2001 and 2003. In comparison of PFGE profile with 22 isolates obtained from 22 apparently healthy broiler chickens between 2001 and 2003, the predominant cluster included the seven strains isolated after 1993. We could not clarify the reasons why the serovar has been prevalent in the broiler industry for a long time, but current antimicrobial usage is not always linked to its prevalence.
