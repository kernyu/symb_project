In experimental rabbit meningitis, gemifloxacin penetrated inflamed meninges well (22 to 33%) and produced excellent bactericidal activity (change in log(10) [Deltalog(10)] CFU/ml/h, -0.68 +/- 0.30 [mean and standard deviation]), even superior to that of the standard regimen of ceftriaxone plus vancomycin (-0.49 +/- 0.09 deltalog(10) CFU/ml/h), in the treatment of meningitis due to a penicillin-resistant pneumococcal strain (MIC, 4 mg/liter). Even against a penicillin- and quinolone-resistant strain, gemifloxacin showed good bactericidal activity (-0.48 +/- 0.16 deltalog(10) CFU/ml/h). The excellent antibacterial activity of gemifloxacin was also confirmed by time-kill assays over 8 h in vitro.
