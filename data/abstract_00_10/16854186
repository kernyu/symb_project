The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility of amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole, to several Candida spp recovered from blood cultures on hospitalized patients at the University Hospital of Maracaibo, Venezuela. The determination of the antifungal susceptibility was carried out according to the microdilution method in broth developed by The European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). The profile of susceptibility of the 74 isolates showed that all the studied species were susceptible to amphotericin B, and 97.2% and 89.2% to fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively.
