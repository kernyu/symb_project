OBJECTIVE: To investigate biological effects of space flight on several conditional pathogenic bacteria and biodestructive fungi. METHOD: Several potentially pathogenic or biodegrading microorganisms, including bacteria, actinomyces and fungi, were carried on-board spacecraft for 7 d. Some of the biological characteristics were studied by using general microbial test technology after recovery. RESULT: In space condition, survival and growth rate were promoted, and soluble pigments were produced, while morphological properties were changed differently. The antibiotic-sensitivity of certain strains decreased, while most of them showed no changes. CONCLUSION: The reproduction ability and growth rate of these microorganisms are promoted after being carried into space, and morphological differentiation increase. The resistance to antibiotics is stable.
