STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the pharmacodynamic profiles of linezolid, levofloxacin, and vancomycin against clinical strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, including vancomycin-tolerant and fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates. DESIGN: In vitro pharmacodynamic model. SETTING: Biosafety level 2, university research laboratory. BACTERIAL STRAINS: Ciprofloxacin-susceptible (79), ciprofloxacin-resistant (R921), and vancomycin-tolerant (P9802-020) clinical strains of S. pneumoniae. INTERVENTION: An in vitro pharmacodynamic model was used to simulate standard dosing regimens of linezolid, levofloxacin, and vancomycin against the isolates 79, R921, and P9802-020. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bacterial density was profiled over 48 hours. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for linezolid, levofloxacin, and vancomycin, respectively were 1, 1, 0.5 microg/ml for isolate 79; 1, 4, 0.5 microg/ml for R921; and 0.5, 0.5, 0.5 microg/ml for P9802-020. Vancomycin minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values varied across large ranges for the tested strains. Linezolid achieved 99.9% kill against 79 and R921 by 24 and 28 hours, respectively. Levofloxacin achieved 99.9% kill against 79 and P9802-020 by 28 and 4 hours, respectively. Vancomycin achieved 99.9% kill against 79 and R921 by 8 and 24 hours, respectively. Levofloxacin did not demonstrate activity against R921 at the 48-hour end point. Minimal kill (< 2 log) at 48 hours was noted for vancomycin and linezolid against P9802-020. Conclusion. Vancomycin tolerance appeared to be more reliably characterized by persistent viability in time-kill analyses than by MBC:MIC ratios. Vancomycin exhibited bactericidal activity against the non-vancomycin-tolerant strains of S. pneumoniae. Linezolid exhibited both bactericidal and bacteriostatic activity against all three strains tested, whereas levofloxacin demonstrated bactericidal activity against the fluoroquinolone-susceptible isolates. Further investigation of treatment alternatives for infections due to vancomycin-tolerant S. pneumoniae are needed.
