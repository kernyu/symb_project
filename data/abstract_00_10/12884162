We describe 4 patients infected with levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci after therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The 4 patients had 15 episodes of CAP; Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from blood or sputum samples obtained during 14 of the episodes. The underlying medical condition was Bruton agammaglobulinemia in 3 patients and chronic lymphoid leukemia in the other. The initial episode of CAP in each patient was due to a levofloxacin-susceptible strain. One of 4 reinfections and 5 of 6 relapses were due to levofloxacin-resistant strains. All of these strains had amino acid substitutions in the quinolone-resistance-determining region of the genes parC and gyrA. The time between episodes of pneumonia varied from 1 to 4 months. In immunocompromised patients with suspected or proven pneumococcal infection, it may be prudent not to use fluoroquinolone monotherapy empirically when the patient has a history of fluoroquinolone therapy in at least the past 4 months.
