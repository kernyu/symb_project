Betalactams, which act by inhibiting the last phase of bacterial cell wall synthesis, constitute the largest family of antimicrobial agents and the most extensively used in current clinical practice. These drug have a slow bactericidal action that is relatively independent of plasma concentrations, little toxicity and a broad therapeutic margin. Their spectrum has increased over the years with the incorporation of new molecules having greater activity against gram-negative bacilli. Nevertheless, the progressive emergence of acquired resistance has limited the empirical use of betalactams and their efficacy in certain situations. Despite this problem, penicillin is still the treatment of choice for a large number of classic infections, cephalosporins are widely used in surgical prophylaxis and severe community-acquired infections, carbapenems are the choice for mixed nosocomial and multiresistant bacterial infections and betalactamase inhibitors permit the effective use of amino- and ureido-penicillins in highly significant infections.
