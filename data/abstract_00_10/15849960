The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by a micromethod of dilution in RPMI-1640 broth in order to know the sensitivity to amphotericin B, itraconazole, ketoconazole and fluconazole of 29 strains of Histoplasma capsulatum var capsulatum isolated in Cuba. Histoplasmosis is one of the main systemic mycosis at the world level and its incidence has increased during the last years, associated mainly with HIV infection and to the appareance of new epidemic outbreaks in different regions. The results obtained allowed to conclude that high values of IMC against fluconazole were found with a geometric mean of 55.5 ug/mL. For amphotericin B, ketoconazole and itraconazole, all the strains were inhibited at low concentrations with geometric means of 0.26, 0.17 and 0.125 ug/mL, respectively. The development for the first time in Cuba of a method to determine the IMC of the main antifungal drugs against H. capsulatum var capsulatum will make possible to establish the sensitivity patterns and to detect the appearance of resistance, which will contribute to know this important mycosis better.
