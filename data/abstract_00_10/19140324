Yeast recombinant plasmid containing FRT-sequence flanked by hybrid GAL-CYC promoter and NPTII gene was developed. GAL-CYC promoter contains four UAS sequences and two closely associated TATA-boxes in CYC part. This construct provides galactose-inducible synthesis of neomycinphosphotransferase from NPTII gene, and, thus, resistance of transformed cells to G418 antibiotic. Nucleosome positioning within NPTII gene in repressed and active states was studied. Under repressive conditions (growth on glucose) stable positioning of three nucleosomes was detected. Two nucleosomes are localized in CYC-part. One of them encompasses both TATA-boxes. The third nucleosome overlaps FRT sequence and start of NPTII gene coding sequence. All three nucleosomes show multiple positioning. It suggests possibility of nucleosome sliding along DNA. After induction of NPTII expression by galactose sliding of two nucleosomes is detected. Sliding leads to exposure of TATA-box and long promoter segment. Sliding results in stable repositioning of nucleosomes at new sites. 5'-distal nucleosome moves closer to UAS-sequences. As a results UAS becomes spatially closer to TATA-box. This proximity facilitates assembly of preinitiation complex. Nucleosomes slides independently from each other. The second nucleosome moves towards FRT-sequence and repositions at its nucleosome positioning signal. Galactose-induced expression does not affect nucleosome positioning with coding region of NPTII gene. Unidirectional sliding and repositioning are detected without induction after deacetylase inhibition with trichostatine A. Basal expression of NPTII gene was shown without activation of GAL-CYC promoter and after spatial uncoupling of coding sequence and promoter by gene inversion. In these cases it seems that expression is driven by TATA-like element in FRT-sequence. This element is located in permanently exposed area (in vivo data).
