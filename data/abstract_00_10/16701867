Titanium is widely used in dental implantology and orthopaedics due to its excellent corrosion resistance and mechanical properties. However, it has been reported that Ti is sensitive to F(-), H(2)O(2) and lactic acid. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to investigate the corrosion resistance of CP-Ti disks after 9 days immersion in different test solutions, based on artificial saliva containing F(-) (0.5% and 2.5%), H(2)O(2) (0.1% and 10%) and/or lactic acid. Because activated macrophages and bacteria can also release locally some of these oxidative compounds, we investigated the role of these cells when plated onto titanium disks. The surface roughness (R(a)) was highly increased when titanium disks were immersed in artificial saliva containing F(-), H(2)O(2) and lactic acid. After 21 days of cell culture, R(a) was significantly increased on disks incubated with activated-J774.2 cells or Streptococcus mitis. AFM appeared to be more sensitive than SEM in evaluating the corrosion of the titanium. Chemical species, either environmental or those released by macrophages and bacteria, can provoke a marked attack of the titanium surface.
