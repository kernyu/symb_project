AIMS: This investigation compared glutaraldehyde (GTA)-sensitive and -resistant strains of Mycobacterium chelonae and examined the effects of pretreatment of GTA-sensitive and -resistant strains of Myco. chelonae with chemical agents that interfere with cell wall synthesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: When exposed to 2% (v/v) GTA at 25 degrees C, GTA-resistant strains of Myco. chelonae dried on to glass carriers were not inactivated to any significant extent. By contrast, GTA-sensitive strains of Myco. chelonae and a strain of Myco. terrae suffered a > 6 log reduction in viability in 5 min. However, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA; 0.5% w/v) achieved a corresponding inactivation against two GTA-resistant strains within 5-10 and 10-20 min, respectively. Electron microscopy, using a non-aldehyde fixation process and also negative staining, failed to detect any extensive changes in GTA-sensitive and -resistant cultures exposed to GTA or OPA. Thin-layer chromatography was unsuccessful in detecting differences between GTA-resistant and -sensitive strains of Myco. chelonae. However, pretreatment of GTA-resistant cells with mycobacterial cell wall synthesis inhibitors increased their subsequent susceptibility further to OPA but not to GTA. CONCLUSION: Ortho-phthalaldehyde is an effective new biocidal agent that, at its in-use concentration, is rapidly bactericidal to non-sporulating bacteria, including GTA-sensitive and -resistant mycobacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Pretreatment of GTA-resistant cells with mycobacterial cell wall synthesis inhibitors increased their subsequent susceptibility to OPA but not to GTA.
