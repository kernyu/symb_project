BACKGROUND: In France, antimicrobial resistance monitoring is based on the contribution of many microbiological partners and networks, especially hospital laboratories. In order to complete this surveillance, the InVS implemented a network based on private-sector laboratories (PSL): the Labville network. METHOD: Stratified by French region, 69 PSL were randomly selected. The microbiological analysis results, including anonymized individual patient data, are translated into an appropriate data format within an automated reading process. This data is then sent to InVS through a secure Internet connection. RESULTS: The specifications of the automated system were defined according to a feasibility study conducted in 2003. The first stage of the project consisted in defining a global strategy for the reading of printed microbiological results. Then, the parameters were adapted for each PSL using a set of specific analysis over two to three weeks. After validation by InVS, the reading strategy was applied on to routinely printed results. The strategy was definitely validated after four month of a daily data transmission. The general approach needs to be adapted to each PSL and undergoes several adjustments. This long step of the project still requires microbiological expertise. CONCLUSION: The automated data extraction process used for Labville project is innovating. It is not affected by the compatibility and diversity of computing systems and reduces the biologist's workload. The Labville network is a challenging project motivating future development of other electronic surveillance networks.
