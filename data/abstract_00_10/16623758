Intragranulomatous necrosis is a primary feature in the natural history of human tuberculosis (TB). Unfortunately, this phenomenon is not usually seen in the experimental TB murine model. Artificial induction of this necrosis in pulmonary granulomas (INPG) may be achieved through aerosol inoculation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 3 weeks after Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. At week 9 post-infection, the centre of primary granulomas became larger, showing eosinophilic necrosis. Interestingly, INPG induction was related to mice strains C57BL/6 and 129/Sv, but not to BALB/c and DBA/2. Furthermore, the same pattern was obtained with the induction of infection using a clinical M. tuberculosis strain (UTE 0335R) that naturally induces INPG. In all the mice strains tested, the study of pulmonary mRNA expression revealed a tendency to increase or to maintain the expression of RANTES, interferon-gamma, tumour necrosis factor and iNOS, in both LPS- and UTE 0335R-induced INPG, thus suggesting that this response must be necessary but not sufficient for inducing INPG. Our work supports that INPG induction is a local phenomenon unrelated to the resistant (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) or susceptible (129/Sv and DBA/2) background of mice strains against M. tuberculosis infection.
