PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews recent publications regarding new antimicrobial drugs for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. RECENT FINDINGS: Newer drugs against vancomycin-resistant enterococci are now available or will soon be available. Quinupristin-dalfopristin, a streptogramin, and linezolid, an oxazolidinone, are effective and safe but only bacteriostatic against enterococi. Bacterial isolates resistant to either antibiotic have been described. Daptomycin, a lipopeptide antimicrobial, has good in-vitro bactericidal activity against enterococci, but very limited clinical data exist regarding the treatment of serious enterococcal infection with this compound. Ramoplanin, the first glycolipodepsipeptide antimicrobial in clinical trials, is not systemically absorbed after oral administration, and is being evaluated for the prevention of bloodstream infection in patients colonized with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Oritavancin and dalbavancin (both glycopeptides) and tigecycline (a monocycline derivative) are being evaluated in phase II and III trials and are not yet commercially available. SUMMARY: Treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci continues to be problematical although these new drugs offer some hope. The rational use of antibiotics, strict guidelines for the use of new compounds, and adherence to infection control practices continue to be essential components of the management of vancomycin-resistant enterococci colonization and infection.
