The availability of the complete genome sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has provided us with unprecedented opportunities for understanding the biology of this highly successful pathogen and its unique interaction with the host. It is hoped that the impetus so provided to mycobacterial research will accelerate the development of effective and novel strategies for the treatment, prevention and detection of tuberculosis.
