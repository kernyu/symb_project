Influenza viruses continue to pose a severe threat worldwide, causing thousands of deaths and an enormous economic loss every year. The major problem in fighting influenza is the high genetic variability of the virus, resulting in the rapid formation of variants that escape the acquired immunity against previous virus strains, or have resistance to antiviral agents. Every virus depends on its host cell and, hence, cellular functions that are essential for viral replication might be suitable targets for antiviral therapy. As a result, intracellular signaling cascades induced by the virus, in particular mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, have recently come into focus.
