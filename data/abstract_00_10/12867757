OBJECTIVE: Several reports have examined the efficacy of long-term lamivudine therapy and the risk factors involved in emergence of viral resistance in Japanese patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, the patient cohorts in such studies are relatively small. METHODS: We analyzed 234 chronically HBV-infected Japanese patients who were treated with lamivudine for more than 12 months. They comprised patients with HBV genotype A (n = 8), genotype B (n = 21), genotype C (n = 203) and other HBV genotypes (n = 2). RESULTS: In most patients, lamivudine resulted in normalization of alanine transaminase (ALT) levels at 6 and 12 months, and suppression of serum HBV DNA to undetectable levels by the branched chain DNA probe assay (bDNA). Rates of ALT normalization and non-detection of HBV DNA were higher among patients with genotype B than genotype C disease. The proportions of patients who achieved HBeAg loss were 27, 42 and 45% after 6 months, 1 year and 2 years, respectively. The emergence of mutations was not different among genotypes A, B and C by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses identified high HBV DNA level (bDNA >or=100 MEq/ml) as an independent factor associated with emergence of the YMDD motif mutation in all patients. Among patients with genotype C disease, which is the predominant HBV genotype in Japan, multivariate analysis also identified high HBV DNA level and HBeAg positivity as factors associated with emergence of resistance. CONCLUSION: Patients exhibiting these factors at the commencement of lamivudine treatment must be monitored carefully at regular intervals for emergence of viral resistance.
