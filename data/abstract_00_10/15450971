The duration of the Mx mRNA response to an intramuscular injection of the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) glycoprotein (G) gene DNA vaccine as well as to the control plasmid was determined in rainbow trout at 14 degrees C over a period of 11 weeks. The Mx response was detectable on day 7, peaked on day 14 and returned to pretreatment levels on day 21 and thereafter. No increase in Mx expression was detectable to the control plasmid. In further experiments, the kinetics of the Mx response were compared in rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon parr kept at 10 degrees C and injected with the DNA vaccine or the synthetic double-stranded RNA, poly I:C. In both species there was a rapid response to poly I:C detectable from day 1, reaching maximum from days 3 to 9 and decreasing to background level by day 12. The peak level and return to background was reached slightly later in salmon. In both species the response to the VHS/DNA vaccine was slower to begin, not being detectable on days 1 and 3, but elevated levels were found on day 6. However, in the salmon parr, the peak level was on day 6 and the signal disappeared by day 12, while in the rainbow trout, the response peaked at day 12 and lasted until day 21. The kinetics of the Mx response to the VHS/DNA vaccine in rainbow trout correlate with the early non-specific protection against VHS in this species following vaccination. It is speculated that the more transient Mx response in Atlantic salmon parr to the DNA vaccine may be related to the innate resistance of salmon to VHS.
