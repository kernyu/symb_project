We describe a 57-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who had a cavitary lesion develop in the right upper lobe caused by Cunninghamella bertholletiae, a zygomycete. The infection was resistant to both high-dose liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole. The current report demonstrates successful treatment, even in the setting of subsequent bone marrow transplantation and immunosuppression, using a combination of surgical resection and posaconazole therapy.
