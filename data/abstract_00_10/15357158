OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an antimicrobial dressing consisting of hydrophilic polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate for activity against several antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates as well as American Type Culture Collection reference strains using zone of inhibition assays. METHODS: Sterile foam samples with chlorhexidine gluconate and untreated controls were transferred onto inoculated agar plates. Plates were incubated at 35 degrees C to 37 degrees C for 24 hours and examined for zones of inhibition around the foam samples. RESULTS: Polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate showed antimicrobial activity in vitro against all of the challenge organisms including antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates. CONCLUSION: The data from this in vitro study support the hypothesis that polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate has an antimicrobial effect against antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species, as well as Candida species.
