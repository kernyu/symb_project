The resistance of Helicobacter pylori to antibiotic treatment is a growing global concern, but this has not been well studied in our environment. This study sought to determine: the susceptibility of the organism to common antimicrobial agents used in its eradication therapy. Twenty H. pylori isolates from dyspeptic patients were subjected to standard procedures for sensitivity testing and the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration against amoxycillin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, rifampicin and tetracycline. The study showed marked in vitro multiple antimicrobial resistance to the commonly used eradication agents. All twenty isolates were however sensitive to ciprofloxacin. The findings of marked antimicrobial resistance may affect the effectiveness of currently recommended eradication regimes. In our environment, incorporating ciprofloxacin into the existing H. pylori antimicrobial therapy may improve the outcome of eradication.
