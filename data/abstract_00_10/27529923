The total tuberculosis morbidity rate in the Kaliningrad and Pskov Regions in 2007 has been found to be higher than the federal (83.2 per 100,000) and regional (62.2 per 100,000) rates. In the Kaliningrad Region, the tuberculosis morbidity rate in children (71.2 per 100,000 children) is the same as in the general population of the region--the highest rate in North-West Russia; however, the proportion of patients with destructive pulmonary tuberculosis, subjects excreting bacteria, including patients with multidrug resistance, is higher than that in the Pskov Region, which indicates late detection of the disease and contradicts the low morbidity rate in children. The tuberculosis morbidity rate among children in the Pskov Region (4.3 per 100,000 children) remains inexplicably low, which may suggest the underdetection of tuberculosis in children; and the presence of generalized and complicated forms is indicative of the hypodiagnosis of early manifestations of tuberculosis infection.
