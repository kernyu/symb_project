Iron-containing materials have been prepared following several strategies of synthesis and using different silica supports (amorphous, zeolitic and mesostructured materials). Activity and stability of these materials was evaluated on the wet peroxide oxidation of phenol under mild reaction conditions (100 degrees C, air pressure of 1MPa and stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide for the complete mineralisation of phenol). Their catalytic performance was monitored in terms of phenol and total organic carbon (TOC) conversions, by-products distribution (aromatics compounds and carboxylic acids) and degree of metal leached into the aqueous solution. The nature and local environment of iron species is strongly dependent on the synthetic route, which dramatically influences their catalytic performance. Crystalline iron oxide species supported over mesostructured SBA-15 materials have demonstrated to be the most interesting catalysts for phenol degradation according to its high organic mineralisation, low sensitivity to leaching out and good oxidant efficiency.
