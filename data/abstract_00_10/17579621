In this study, we set out to establish whether fludarabine could enhance the DNA interstrand crosslinking capacity of SJG-136 in primary human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells and thereby offer a rationale for its clinical use in combination with SJG-136. SJG-136 rapidly induced DNA crosslinking in primary CLL cells which was concentration-dependent. Further, the level of crosslinking correlated with sensitivity to SJG-136-induced apoptosis (P=0.001) and higher levels of crosslinking were induced by the combination of SJG-136 and fludarabine (P=0.002). All of the samples tested (n=40) demonstrated synergy between SJG-136 and fludarabine (mean combination index (CI)=0.54+/-0.2) and this was even retained in samples derived from patients with fludarabine resistance (mean CI=0.62+/-0.3). Transcription of the excision repair enzyme, ERCC1, was consistently increased (20/20) in response to SJG-136 (P<0.0001). In contrast, fludarabine suppressed ERCC1 transcription (P=0.04) and inhibited SJG-136-induced ERCC1 transcription when used in combination (P=0.001). Importantly, the ability of fludarabine to suppress ERCC1 transcription correlated with the degree of synergy observed between SJG-136 and fludarabine (r(2)=0.28; P=0.017) offering a mechanistic rationale for the synergistic interaction. The data presented here provides a clear indication that this combination of drugs may have clinical utility as salvage therapy in drug-resistant CLL.
