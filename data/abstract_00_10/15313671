BACKGROUND: Some factors have been reported to be associated with a greater likelihood of sustained viral response (SVR) in the interferon (IFN) treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The factors include HCV genotype, HCV RNA level in serum, state of liver disease, baseline body weight, age, sex, and race. The aim of this trial was to investigate the influence of HCV genotype on the IFN treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. METHODS: The genotypes of HCV virus were determined in the patients with chronic hepatitis C from several hospitals of China enrolled into the randomized, opened and controlled trial of Peg-IFN alpha-2a (pegasys) treatment, controlled with IFN-alpha-2a (roferon-A). The serum ALT levels and HCV RNA concentrations of the patients were detected before and at the end of treatment and during the follow-up. The influence of HCV genotype on the IFN treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C was analyzed in intention-to-treat (ITT) population. RESULTS: The HCV genotypes of 202 patients were determined. Of these patients, 158(78.22%) were infected with genotype 1 HCV and 44(21.78%) with genotype non-1. The viral response at the end of treatment (ETVR) and sustained viral response (SVR) rates were 53.80% and 25.32% respectively in patients with genotype 1 HCV, but they were 61.36% and 43.18% in patients with genotype non-1. The difference of SVR between patients with genotype 1 HCV and those with genotype non-1 was significant (P=0.021). After being grouped by the used drugs, the ETVR rates of patients infected with genotype 1 and non-1 HCV were 76.83% and 80.95% in the patients treated with pegasys (P=0.686); but their SVR rates were 35.37% and 66.67% (P=0.01). The viral relapse rate of genotype 1 HCV (55.56%) was significantly higher than that of genotype non-1 HCV (23.53%) (P=0.02). In roferon-A group, the ETVR and SVR rates of patients with genotype 1 HCV were 28.95% and 14.47% respectively, which were lower but not more significant than those of patients with genotype non-1 HCV (43.48% and 21.74%). Moreover, the viral relapse rate of genotype 1 HCV (72.73%) was higher but not more significant than that of genotype non-1 HCV (50.00%) (P=0.21). CONCLUSION: HCV genotype could affect the efficacies, mainly sustained responses, of IFN treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C, and the effects of IFN are related to drugs and therapeutic course.
