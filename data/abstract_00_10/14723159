Biological properties of 68 Candida strains isolated from parodontal pockets of patients with generalized parodontitis complicated with candidosis have been investigated. It was established that 72.1 +/- 5.43% of strains belong to Candida albicans. The clinical Candida albicans isolates display high resistance to nystatin and levorin, but they are sensitive to synthetic antifungal drugs 5-fluorocytosine, fluconazol, especially to ketoconazol, itraconazole and to antifungal antibiotic amphotericin B as well.
