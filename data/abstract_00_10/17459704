A series of novel acylide derivatives have been synthesized from erythromycin A via a facile procedure. By applying this procedure, cyclic carbonation to C-11,12 position, acylation to C-3 hydroxyl, and deprotection provided the desired acylides. These compounds showed antibacterial activity against both macrolide-susceptible strains and macrolide-resistant strains. Because of existence of 6-O-allyl substitution, these derivatives can be used as intermediates for further structural modification.
