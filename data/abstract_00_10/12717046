At the International AIDS Society-USA course in New York in October 2002, Douglas T. Dieterich, MD, presented the case history of a patient coinfected with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV infection in patients with HIV is associated with worse prognosis for HBV disease than in patients without HIV and complicates management of both diseases. However, newer treatment options for chronic HBV infection increase the potential for successful management.
