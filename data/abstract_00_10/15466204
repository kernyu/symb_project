Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of tumorigenic and transformed cell lines but not in many normal cells. Hence, TRAIL has the potential to be an ideal cancer therapeutic agent with minimal cytotoxicity. FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) is an important regulator of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Here, we show that persistent expression of c-FLIP(Long) [c-FLIP(L)] is inversely correlated with the ability of TRAIL to induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. In contrast to TRAIL-sensitive cells, TRAIL-resistant LNCaP and PC3-TR (a TRAIL-resistant subpopulation of PC3) cells showed increased c-FLIP(L) mRNA levels and maintained steady protein expression of c-FLIP(L) after treatment with TRAIL. Ectopic expression of c-FLIP(L) in TRAIL-sensitive PC3 cells changed their phenotype from TRAIL sensitive to TRAIL resistant. Conversely, silencing of c-FLIP(L) expression by small interfering RNA in PC3-TR cells reversed their phenotype from TRAIL resistant to TRAIL sensitive. Therefore, persistent expression of c-FLIP(L) is necessary and sufficient to regulate sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.
