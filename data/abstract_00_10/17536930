There are little data on the genetic relatedness between antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal isolates colonizing the Ugandan population. Penicillin-intermediate pneumococci of serogroups or serotypes rarely or not previously reported as being penicillin nonsusceptible were selected out of 166 isolates representing 26 capsular serogroups or serotypes isolated from Ugandan children in 1995 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected Ugandan adults in 2004-2005. Pairs of penicillin-intermediate pneumococci of the same serogroup or serotype present in both patient populations were characterized further by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Seven such pairs of isolates were found and included serogroups 7, 11, 15B/C, and 16 as well as serotypes 13, 21, and 35B. PFGE of these seven pairs showed no clonality between serogroups or serotypes, and clonality only within serogroup 11 and serotype 13. MLST of the 14 individual isolates revealed 13 different sequence types (STs), 11 of which had not previously been recorded. Comparisons with all known STs revealed that most of these strains were related only to strains of the same serotype in other countries, with these related strains frequently also being penicillin intermediate. These findings suggest that penicillin nonsusceptibility in Uganda is likely due to the introduction of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal clones into Uganda rather than development of resistance within the country.
