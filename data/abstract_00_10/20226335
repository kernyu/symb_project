We investigated vancomycin and daptomycin efficacy for Staphylococcus aureus isolates at our institution by testing 221 methicillin-sensitive and 299 methicillin-resistant isolates recovered from serious infections between 1979 and 2007 using a microdilution method. The MIC(90)'s for vancomycin remained constant at 2 microg/mL for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). For MSSA, the geometric mean vancomycin MICs remained at 1.1 microg/mL but varied from 1.1 to 1.7 for MRSA. Tolerance to vancomycin was seen in 6.5% of MRSA and 10.5% of MSSA. Daptomycin MIC(90)'s remained at < or =1 microg/mL, and the daptomycin concentration at which 90% of the strains were killed (MBC(90)) remained at 2 microg/ml. Over 29 years, no trend was detected in vancomycin or daptomycin susceptibilities. Daptomycin had excellent inhibitory and bactericidal activities against all strains throughout the years. Although vancomycin's inhibitory activity was consistent over time, vancomycin-tolerant strains whose presence was not predicted by their MIC were found.
