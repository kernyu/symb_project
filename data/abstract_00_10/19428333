Cytarabine (ara-C) is the key agent for treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML). After being transported into leukemic cells by human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1), ara-C is phosphorylated to ara-C triphosphate (ara-CTP), an active metabolite, and then incorporated into DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) are associated with the production of ara-CTP. Because ara-C's cytotoxicity depends on ara-CTP production, parameters that are most related to ara-CTP formation would predict ara-C sensitivity and the clinical outcome of ara-C therapy. The present study focused on finding any correlation between the capacity to produce ara-CTP and ara-C-metabolizing factors. In vitro ara-CTP production, mRNA levels of hENT1, dCK, and cN-II, and ara-C sensitivity were evaluated in 34 blast samples from 33 leukemic patients including 26 with AML. A large degree of heterogeneity was seen in the capacity to produce ara-CTP and in mRNA levels of hENT1, dCK, and cN-II. Despite the lack of any association between each of the transcript levels and ara-CTP production, the ratio of dCK/cN-II transcript levels correlated significantly with the amount of ara-CTP among AML samples. The HL-60 cultured leukemia cell line and its three ara-C-resistant variants (HL-60/R1, HL-60/R2, HL-60/R3), which were 8-, 10-, and 500-fold more resistant than HL-60, respectively, were evaluated similarly. The dCK/cN-II ratio was again proportional to ara-CTP production and to ara-C sensitivity. The dCK/cN-II ratio may thus predict the capacity for ara-CTP production and ultimately, ara-C sensitivity in AML.
