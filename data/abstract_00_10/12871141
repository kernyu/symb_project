This article is an overview of antimicrobial peptides found in anurans skin secretions. These molecules constitute an initial barrier against microbial infections because of their activity against a large array of microorganisms. These peptides hold remarkable pharmaceutical and technological interest since they selectively kill microorganisms and are unlikely to induce resistance in pathogens. Also, outstanding synergism occurs when these peptides are combined with classic antibiotics and other antimicrobial peptides.
