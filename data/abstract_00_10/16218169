BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in renal-transplant recipients. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of long-term lamivudine monotherapy in renal-transplant recipients with HBV-related cirrhosis. METHODS: Seventeen such patients [median age: 45 years; 7 with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)] received daily oral doses of 75-150 mg lamivudine for a median of 48 (range 11-81) months. All patients had baseline serum levels of HBV DNA of over 6 log10 copies per ml and of alanine transaminase (ALT) of over 1.5 times the upper normal limit (UNL). Clinical lamivudine resistance was defined as a rebound of serum HBV DNA above 5.3 log10 copies per ml and of serum ALT of over 1.5 times the UNL in patients who initially responded with HBV DNA levels of less than 5.3 log10 copies per ml and normal ALT values. Controls were 14 renal-transplant patients (median age 44 years; 3 with HBeAg) with HBV-related cirrhosis, naive to any anti-HBV therapy, followed for 58 months (4-135). RESULTS: Thirteen (77%) treated patients had a persistent response throughout the study period, including three (18%) who developed genotypic resistance, compared with none of the untreated controls (77% versus 0%, P < 0.0001). Four (23%) developed clinical resistance. Two of three patients with initially decompensated cirrhosis had a durable response and clinical improvement compared with the transient responder, whose liver function worsened following lamivudine resistance. Two responders developed chronic rejection requiring chronic haemodialysis. Overall, one treated patient developed liver-related complications, compared with eight untreated controls (6% versus 57%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Most renal-transplant patients treated with lamivudine achieved a rapid and durable suppression of HBV, which substantially lowered the risk of liver decompensation and death.
