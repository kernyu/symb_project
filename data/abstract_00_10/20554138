OBJECTIVE: To evaluate retrospectively indications of moxifloxacin prescriptions in inpatients with tuberculosis in a referent teaching hospital. DESIGN: All patients hospitalized at Bichat-Claude Bernard hospital and who had an active tuberculosis disease with a tuberculosis regimen including moxifloxacin were included. Medical charts were retrospectively reviewed for all these patients over 21 months. Data collected were reasons for introduction of moxifloxacin in regimen. RESULTS: Out of the 23 patients included in the study, 13 of them had a recurrence of tuberculosis. Several reasons for introduction of moxifloxacin were recorded and one prescription can be associated with one or more reasons: an extra pulmonary tuberculosis or disseminated tuberculosis (16 cases), an intolerance to other anti-tuberculosis drugs (13 cases), a medical history of therapeutic failure or a proved or suspected drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (12 cases) or to avoid drug interactions (two cases). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study in our hospital highlights that drug-resistance was not the first reason for introduction of moxifloxacin in anti-tuberculosis regimen. One major indication was bad tolerance to other first-line regimen drugs. A better supervision of the moxifloxacin prescription in tuberculosis regimen is needed in order to limit its ecological impact.
