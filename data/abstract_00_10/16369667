The activity of seven macrolides, clindamycin and telithromycin against clinical isolates of Corynebacterium spp. was studied. Of these, 36 isolates were identified as C. jeikeium and 57 as C. amycolatum. The frequency of resistance to erythromycin and other macrolides as well as clindamycin was high, with CMI(90) >256 microg/ml. Telithromycin showed the best activity, with 52.3% of C. amycolatum and 70% of C. jeikeium erythromycin-resistant strains susceptible to this ketolide. All strains had the MLSb constitutive phenotype. The ermX gene was present in all erythromycin-resistant strains, and in C. amycolatum was 100% homologous with that of C. striatum and C. diphtheriae.
