A thorough knowledge of all topical antibiotics treatment options is important as more pathogens become resistant to standard therapies. As resistance to mupirocin increases, it seems that triple antibiotic ointments and retapamulin (the newest FDA-approved agent) will have greater roles in treating impetigo and skin infections. Awareness of all these agents provides a dermatologist additional tools with which to treat skin infections. As a wide variety of topical antibiotics, combination antibiotics, and combination anti-inflammatory preparations used by ophthalmologists are not part of the therapeutic armamentarium of most dermatologists, this review will provide the knowledge needed to rationally use such ophthalmologic preparations. Finally, information related to the topical nadifloxacin for acne and skin infections, which is in clinical use in Japan, is summarized.
