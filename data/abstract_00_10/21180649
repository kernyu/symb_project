Artemisinin, with its 1,2,4-trioxane as active motif, is now the first-line treatment for multidrug-resistant malaria. The endoperoxide ring is essential for the antimalarial activity of artemisinin. Based on its mechanism of action, new hybrid molecules named trioxaquines with a dual mode of action have been designed. Trioxaquines are made by the covalent attachment of a trioxane, having alkylating ability, to a quinoline, known to easily penetrate within infected erythrocytes. This review discusses the importance of various hybrid molecules of artemisinin and 4-aminoquinoline in the treatment of malaria and the evolution of a trioxaquine hybrid as a promising antimalarial drug candidate.
