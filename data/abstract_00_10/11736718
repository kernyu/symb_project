BACKGROUND: Antibiotic prophylaxis for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion remains controversial. The bacteriology of peristomal infection following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion has been poorly studied, leading to uncertainty regarding the optimum choice of antibiotic for prophylaxis. AIM: To investigate the bacteriology of peristomal infection following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion and to determine the contribution of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: Nasal and pharyngeal swabs were taken from a consecutive series of patients prior to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion over a 6-month period. Bacterial colonization and infection at the peristomal site were prospectively evaluated at days 2/3 and 7 post-insertion. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion (mean age, 68 years; cerebrovascular disease, 52%). Naso-pharyngeal colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (35%) invariably led to peristomal colonization following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion. Peristomal infection occurred in eight (26%) cases (seven (88%) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus- positive). Peristomal infection was significantly more likely to occur in patients with naso-pharyngeal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization (odds ratio, 10.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-70.9). CONCLUSIONS: Naso-pharyngeal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization invariably predicts peristomal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion, and is associated with an increased peristomal infection rate. Currently recommended antibiotic prophylaxis regimens may be inappropriate in institutions with significant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization rates.
