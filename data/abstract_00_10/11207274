Because of their relative resistance to viral cytopathic effects, APC can provide an alternative reservoir for latently integrated HIV. We used an HIV-transgenic mouse model in which APC serve as the major source of inducible HIV expression to study mechanisms by which integrated virus can be activated in these cells. When admixed with transgenic APC, activated T lymphocytes provided a major contact-dependent stimulus for viral protein expression in vitro. Using blocking anti-CD154 mAb as well as CD154-deficient T cells, the HIV response induced by activated T lymphocytes was demonstrated to require CD40-CD154 interaction. The role of this pathway in the induction of HIV expression from APC in vivo was further studied in an experimental model involving infection of the HIV-transgenic mice with PLASMODIUM: chabaudi parasites. Enhanced viral production by dendritic cells and macrophages in infected mice was associated with up-regulated CD40 expression. More importantly, in vivo treatment with blocking anti-CD154 mAb markedly reduced viral expression in P. chabaudi-infected animals. Together, these findings indicate that immune activation of integrated HIV can be driven by the costimulatory interaction of activated T cells with APC. Because chronic T cell activation driven by coinfections as well as HIV-1 itself is a characteristic of HIV disease, this pathway may be important in sustaining viral expression from APC reservoirs.
