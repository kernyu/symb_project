The introduction of phenylhydrazine in rats inhibited the hemopoiesis, decreased the functional activity of immune cells, hepatocytes and myocytes, and reduced the work capacity. The combined administration of essentiale and riboxin decreased the expression of inhibition of the nonspecific resistance and immune reactivity in rats pretreated with phenylhydrazine. The combined use of essentiale and elkar produced a hepatoprotective effect in rats with phenylhydrazine-induced hemotoxic anemia. Elkar in combination with riboxin enhance the physical work capacity in rats poisoned by the hemotropic toxin. The pairwise drug injections did not influence the reduced content of erythrocytes and hemoglobin in the blood caused by phenylhydrazine. However, the combined injection of all the three drugs (essentiale, riboxin and elkar) decreased the expression of hemopoiesis inhibition.
