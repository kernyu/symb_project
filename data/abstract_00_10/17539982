BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori resistance to antibiotics is increasing worldwide, and it reduces the efficacy of therapy. AIM: To assess current primary antibiotic resistance in H. pylori strains isolated in Italy. METHODS: Between June 2004 and June 2006, H. pylori strains were isolated consecutively in the two participating centres (Bologna, northern Italy; Rome, central Italy) from patients never previously treated for the infection. Isolated strains were tested for primary clarithromycin, metronidazole and levofloxacin resistance using as break point the minimal inhibitory concentration >/=1, >/=8 and >/=1 mg/L for the three antibiotics, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, 255 H. pylori strains were evaluated. The resistance rate was 16.9% for clarithromycin, 29.4% for metronidazole and 19.1% for levofloxacin. Clarithromycin resistance was significantly higher in non-ulcer dyspepsia than in peptic ulcer patients (19.1% vs. 0%, P = 0.02), metronidazole resistance was higher in foreign than Italian patients (50% vs. 22.9%, P = 0.0004) and levofloxacin resistance was higher in old than younger patients (28.4% vs. 14.4%, P = 0.048). Levofloxacin resistance was also more frequent in those strains with either clarithromycin or metronidazole resistance. CONCLUSION: A very high rate of primary resistance towards the tested antibiotics was detected in our study.
