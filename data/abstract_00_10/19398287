The annual incidence of community acquired meningitis ranges between 0.6 and four per 100,000 adults in industrialized countries. The most common causative bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes. The emergence of resistance to antibiotics, especially for S. pneumoniae, could explain the clinical failure of third generation cephalosporins used to treat adults with S. pneumoniae meningitis. The present therapeutic suggestions are more based on the extrapolation of an experimental model than on relevant clinical trials.
