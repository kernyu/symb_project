The objective of this study is to highlight the alarming rise in antimicrobial resistance among Shigella species in Jos, Plateau State. Stool samples of eight hundred and ten patients who presented at the Jos University Teaching Hospital with diarrhoea/dysentery were analysed using standard bacteriological techniques. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates were determined. 25 Shigella species were isolated representing 3.1% isolation rate. The male to female ratio is 1.3:1, children aged 0-10 years constituted 16(64%) of the cases. Shigella flexneri (48%) was the most common sero-group. This was followed by S. boydii (24%), then S. sonnei (20%), and S. dysenteriae (8%). Most strains of shigella species were resistant to Ampicillin (96.0%). Chloramphenicol (96.0%), Cotrimoxazole (88%), Nalidixic acid (84%) and Tetracycline (75%). All strains were found to be sensitive to Ciprofloxacin. The drugs of choice in the treatment of Shigella infection in this environment should be Ciprofloxacin and Ofloxacin. Gentamicin was the third drug of choice its use is limited since the infection is not systemic. To avoid continuous abuse of antibiotics in our country there should be an effective legislation by the government to control the indiscriminate purchase of antibiotics.
