Antimicrobial activity of antibiotics and chemotherapeutics has been investigated for several years. However, a great variety of pharmaceutical preparations, which are applied in the management of non-infectious diseases have shown also some in vitro antimicrobial activity. These drugs are called "non-antibiotics". Detected antimicrobial action of non-antibiotics (and non-chemotherapeutics), emphasises a necessity to neutralise this activity during microbial purity examination in the pharmaceutical industry. It is possible that some of these compounds can enhance the activity of certain antibiotics against bacteria or fungi.
