OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of high-dose lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) therapy in multiple protease inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-experienced subjects. METHOD: Thirty-six HIV-1-infected subjects were randomized to LPV/r 400/300 mg or 667/167 mg bid in a 48-week, open-label study. Subjects also received investigator-selected nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Primary outcomes were the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies/mL at week 24 and time until loss of virologic response through week 48. RESULTS: Six of 17 (35%) and 10 of 19 (53%) subjects in the 400/300 and 667/167 groups, respectively, completed 48 weeks of treatment. Median durations of follow-up in discontinued subjects and all subjects were 15 weeks and 32 weeks, respectively. Forty-four percent of subjects achieved HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at least once; 18% (400/300 mg) and 21% (667/167 mg) of subjects achieved HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at week 24 (intent-to-treat analysis). Corresponding results at week 48 were 18% (400/300 mg) and 26% (667/167 mg). No statistically significant differences in adverse event incidence occurred between treatment groups, except for a higher vomiting rate in the 400/300 mg dose group. Predictors of response included baseline LPV inhibitory quotient and number of active NRTIs. CONCLUSION: Higher doses of LPV/r may provide substantial antiviral activity in multiple class-experienced subjects.
