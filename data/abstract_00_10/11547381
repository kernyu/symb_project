Use of vancomycin to treat infections and hospital colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has contributed to the development of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus. Postoperative infection with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus developed in 2 patients after total knee arthroplasty, indicating that the infections were nosocomial. Both patients required multiple procedures. The infections were controlled with serial open debridements. One knee was fused successfully, and the other was managed with resection arthroplasty.
