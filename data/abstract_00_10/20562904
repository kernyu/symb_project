AIM: To synthesize a novel polyamide SL-A92 and evaluate its bioactivity against drug resistance in Candida albicans. METHODS: SL-A92 was synthesized using N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT)/N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) in solution phase. Its antifungal activities and effects on strain growth were tested using the micro-broth dilution method and growth curves, respectively. Induced drug resistance in the C. albicans collection strain SC5314 was obtained by incubation with fluconazole (12 microg/mL) for 21 passages. Meanwhile, incubations with SL-A92 plus fluconazole were also carried out in SC5314 strains, and the MIC(80)s were used to evaluate the inhibitory effects of SL-A92 on drug resistance during the induction process. Real time RT-PCR was performed to investigate the CDR1 and CDR2 mRNA levels in induced SC5314 strains. RESULTS: SC5314 strain induced by the combination of fluconazole and SL-A92 (200 microg/mL) did not develop drug resistance. On day 24, the CDR1 and CDR2 mRNA levels in SC5314 strain co-treated with fluconazole and SL-A92 relative to fluconazole alone were 26% and 24%, respectively, and on day 30 the CDR1 and CDR2 mRNA levels were 43% and 31%, respectively. CONCLUSION: SL-A92 can block the development of drug resistance during the fluconazole induction process, which partially results from the down-regulation of CDR1 and CDR2.
