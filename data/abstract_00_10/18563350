Bis, tris and tetra(dihydrocaffeoyl)polyamine conjugates were synthesized using solid phase synthesis technique. These compounds were screened for antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (11 strains) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) (4 strains). Bis, tris and tetra(dihydrocaffeoyl)polyamine analogues showed antibacterial activity against VRSA which were better than the reference drugs, vancomycin. Tetra(dihydrocaffeoyl)polyamine conjugate exhibited the highest activity. These compounds showed no cytotoxicity against vero cells.
