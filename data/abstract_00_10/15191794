Antibiotics are an important class of therapeutic agents, which are used for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases in a variety of animal species. Antibiotic therapy varies from treatment period to administration routes, depending on the animal species or the type of the disease being treated. Despite the fact that there are a wide variety of commercially available antibiotics, difficulties and problems associated with the administration of antibiotics to animals still exist. Thus, there is a great need and tremendous opportunity to develop long-acting antibiotic formulations for veterinary applications. In this review article, common approaches used to develop long-acting antibiotic formulations are summarized. The challenges and issues related to the development of these long-acting formulations are also discussed.
