OBJECTIVE: Triclosan is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria but lesser against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.aeruginosa). 2-phenylphenol is considered as an effective agent against fungi but its antifungal action is more important than its antibacterial activity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the bactericidal and fungicidal activities of triclosan and 2-phenylphenol alone, and in combination against standard strains of bacteria and fungi. METHODS: The study was carried out in the Research Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan, during the year 2004. The standard French method of in-vitro dilution quantitative suspension test, according to the Association Francoise de Normalization (AFNOR) guideline, has been used to determine the antibacterial and antifungal activity of each agent alone as well as the combination of the agents. RESULTS: The antibacterial activity of the combination triclosan-2-phenylphenol was significantly enhanced over that of each agent used alone against P.aeruginosa. Synergistic effect was observed against all tested strains of fungi. CONCLUSION: This synergistic effect that was exhibited by triclosan-2-phenylphenol combination can be considered to enhance the antibacterial activity against P.aeruginosa and the antifungal activity of the 2 agents, to reduce the in-use concentration of each agent used alone, that may minimize any possible side effect of the 2 agents, and to avoid the occurrence of bacterial resistance to one of the 2 agents.
