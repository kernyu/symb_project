The frequency rate of resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) was investigated in 273 patients with primary diagnosis and in 117 patients with relapses, who were registered with tuberculosis of respiratory organs, during 2000-2001, at a TB prophylactic center. Resistance was detected in 12.5 and 17.1% of the obtained cultures, respectively. Mono-resistance was found, from among 54 patients with stable strains, in 25.9% of cases, while multi-resistance, which was detected more often in relapses rather than in persons with primary diagnosis, was found in 50% of cases. The efficiency of treatment depended on a number of preparations, to which there was MBT resistance. The best results were obtained in cases of mono-resistance, the worst ones--in cases of multi-resistance. The latter is an indication for changing the standard chemotherapy scheme. The treatment of primarily diagnosed patients turned out to be more effective as compared to that of patients with relapses.
