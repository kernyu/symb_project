We evaluated the pattern of sputum smear positivity and assessed the effects of directly observed treatment short course (DOTS) among tuberculosis (TB) patients at the DOTS clinics in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. In total, 1391 patients were seen at six microscopy and treatment centres across the FCT between January and December 2003. Their sputa were screened microscopically for the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) using the Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique. In total, 296 (21.3%) patients were smear positive; 201 (67.9%) were new cases and 95 (32.1%) were follow-up cases. The highest incidence of sputum smear positivity (24.8%) was found in those aged 21-30 years and the lowest incidence (6%) was found in those aged 71 years and above. No incidence of smear positivity was recorded in children aged 0-10 years. In total, 160 of the men screened were AFB positive (75% new cases, 25% follow-up cases). In comparison, 136 women were AFB positive (59.6% new cases, 40.4% follow-up cases). During the 1-year study period, two deaths were recorded. Men pose a serious threat to public health as most of the follow-up cases result in the tubercle bacilli developing resistance to available anti-TB drugs. This study demonstrated a high prevalence of infectious TB in the population screened, and therefore underlines the need for capacity building through a multisectoral approach in the fight against the disease. Cohort analysis should be the cardinal management strategy in evaluating the effectiveness of TB control through systemic follow-up and reporting of certain indicators in treatment progress and success.
