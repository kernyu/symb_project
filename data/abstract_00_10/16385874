Entry inhibitors include a variety of drugs with different points of attack and with the common objective of preventing the entry of HIV into the cell. Whereas the only previously approved medication from this group, enfuvirtide, can be only injected subcutaneously and, thus, is indicated for only treatment-experienced patients, the CCR5 antagonists represent a group of experimental medications whose use is conceivable at all stages of the HIV infection. According to the available data, they are effective and also very well tolerated and, therefore, are one of the most promising future classes of drugs. At the moment, the prospective importance of substances possessing other mechanisms of action (attachment inhibitors, CXCR4 inhibitors) can not yet be predicted.
