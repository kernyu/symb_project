In order to determine how widespread antibiotic resistance has become to standard treatments, the in vitro susceptibilities of 28 Mycoplasma agalactiae Spanish field isolates to 16 antimicrobial agents were determined using a broth microdilution method. The most effective antimicrobials based on minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(90) values were fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines and macrolides. Two strains were tetracycline resistant. Streptomycin, erythromycin and nalidixic acid resistance was observed in all strains.
