Enterococcus includes species that may pose emerging health risks and has been used as biomarkers for environmental contamination while little is known concerning their occurrence in marine water. Classification of enterococci in environmental samples can be problematic and requires polyphasic taxonomy. In this study, we investigated the presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in the inner bay of Thermaikos Gulf in Northern Greece. Based on physiological and biochemical criteria, 121 presumptive enterococcal strains were identified. High-level VRE were undetectable in seawater and only 35 vancomycin gene-negative strains possessed low-level vancomycin resistance. Genotyping by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) proved to be more reliable for marine enterococcal discrimination and revealed distinguished characteristics of the seawater enterococci, indicating high genetic diversity. Random amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) was unable to separate distinct species analyzed in this study. This study indicates the need of polyphasic taxonomy for seawater enterococcal species' identification and provides information for future biomonitoring programs of Thermaikos Gulf.
