While randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the excellent efficacy of sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) for de novo lesions, the optimal treatment for SES-restenosis is not known. Management may include stand-alone balloon angioplasty, repeat SES implantation, or placement of a drug-eluting stent (DES) with an alternative antiproliferative agent (i.e., a paclitaxel-eluting stent, PES). The appropriate management strategy for recurrent restenosis after PES implantation for SES restenosis is even less clear. We report the initial clinical experience with intracoronary radiation therapy (ICRT) for multi-DES resistant restenosis. We performed ICRT in five patients with recurrent restenosis after treatment with both SES and PES. Over a median follow-up of 256 days (range 75-489 days), one patient had a target lesion revascularization at 182 days and subsequently died at 483 days following the procedure. Our findings support the further study of this management approach.
