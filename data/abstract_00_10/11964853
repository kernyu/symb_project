Acute otitis media is the most commonly diagnosed illness in children, and is one of the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription. In many countries, antibiotic resistance is increasing among the bacteria that are implicated in acute otitis media, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae. This evolution should stimulate changes in the management of acute otitis media, particularly the following: improvement in diagnostic accuracy; reduction in antibiotic use; selection of the most appropriate drugs at the appropriate dosage; reduction in duration of treatment, when possible; and implementation of new vaccines.
