The p53 protein is mutated in 50% of all human tumors and plays a key role in apoptosis, cell cycle, and the expression of several genes. We investigated if p53 mutations influence the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk)/ganciclovir (GCV)-induced bystander effect (BE). Additionally, we studied some of the underlying mechanisms. GCV sensitivity and BE were studied in a human ovarian carcinoma cell line transfected with an empty vector (A2780/cmv) or a vector containing a p53 hotspot mutation at codon 175 (A2780/m175) or 248 (A2780/m248). In addition, expression levels of two nucleoside analogue transporters, multidrug resistance-related protein 4 and 5 (MRP4/MRP5), were determined. Finally, differences in gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) were studied by determining connexin 43 (Cx43) expression and by modulating GJIC with 18-alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid. Our results showed that compared to A2780/cmv, GCV sensitivity was significantly decreased in A2780/m175 and A2780/m248. Additionally, a significant BE (relative increase in cell kill) was found in A2780/cmv and A2780/m248. In contrast, an increased survival was observed in A2780/m175. No MRP4 or MRP5 expression was detected. However, all A2780 cell lines expressed Cx43. Modulating the GJIC significantly decreased the BE in A2780/cmv and A2780/ m248. In conclusion, HSV-tk/GCV-induced BE is influenced by p53 mutations. Differences in GJIC could be one of the underlying mechanisms.
