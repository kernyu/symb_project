We isolated 19 lincomycin-resistant Bacillus subtilis mutants by expressing lmrB encoding a putative multidrug efflux protein. Eighteen of the mutants altered at two regions (-3 to -1 and +15) immediately downstream of the -10 region of the lmr promoter increased lmr transcription in vivo and in vitro.
