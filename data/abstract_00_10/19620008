In order to seek vancomycin analogs with improved performance against VanA and VanB resistant bacterial strains, extensive computational investigations have been performed to examine the effects of side-chain and backbone modifications. Changes in binding affinities for tripeptide cell-wall precursor mimics, Ac(2)-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala (3) and Ac(2)-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Lac (4), with vancomycin analogs were computed with Monte Carlo/free energy perturbation (MC/FEP) calculations. Replacements of the 3-hydroxyl group in residue 7 with small alkyl or alkoxy groups, which improve contacts with the methyl side chain of the ligands'd-Ala residue, are predicted to be the most promising to enhance binding for both ligands. The previously reported amine backbone modification as in 5 is shown to complement the hydrophobic modifications for binding monoacetylated tripeptides. In addition, replacement of the hydroxyl groups in residues 5 and 7 by fluorine is computed to have negligible impact on binding the tripeptides, though it may be pharmacologically advantageous.
