OBJECTIVE: To explore methods of preventing and reversing rejection after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK). METHODS: Seventeen patients performed SPK operation from Sep, 1999 to Sep, 2003 were reviewed retrospectively. Immunosuppression was achieved by triple regimen consisting of cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)/azathioprine and steroid. 2 patients were treated with Dalizumab, the other three patients used OKT3 as immune induction. RESULTS: 1 patient experienced the accelerated rejection, the pancreas and kidney grafts were resected because of failure of conservative therapy. 8 patients experienced renal acute rejection, 2 cases suffered from pancreas acute rejection at the same time. All these patients received daily high dose pulse steroid for 3 days. OKT3 was administered in 2 patients with steroid resistance rejection. All the grafts were successfully rescued. CONCLUSIONS: Reasonable application of immunosuppression after SPK operation and adoption of systemic measures which can reduce sensitivity of high risk receptor before SPK operation are the effective methods of preventing and treating rejection.
