Eleven genotypically related Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were obtained from 11 patients. All isolates were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins due to the production of SHV-2a extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Comparison of the outer membrane protein profiles revealed one isolate that lacked porins. This porin-deficient isolate was also resistant to cefoxitin (MIC 128 microg ml(-1)) and moxalactam (MIC 64 microg ml(-1)) and had elevated MIC of meropenem (2 microg ml(-1)) when compared to porin-expressing isolates (2-8, 4 and <0.06-0.125 microg ml(-1), respectively). Higher MICs, associated with loss of porins in outer membrane, were also observed for cefotaxime (4-8-fold), cefepime (>2-16-fold), ciprofloxacin (4-16-fold), imipenem and aztreonam (2-16-fold), but there was no significant difference among MICs of ceftazidime. The porin-deficient mutant was probably selected in vivo during ofloxacin therapy.
