A dog with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia developed transient hyperglycaemia and glucosuria requiring insulin therapy in association with prednisone and cyclosporin A therapy. Following short-term therapy with insulin and cyclosporin A, the dog remained on prednisone therapy but required no further insulin therapy for 12 weeks, at which time the dog became permanently diabetic. We hypothesise that prednisone and cyclosporin A contributed to insulin resistance in a prediabetic dog with suboptimal endogenous insulin concentration and that the degree of insulin resistance decreased when cyclosporin A therapy was discontinued.
