Characterization of important non-O157 verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) has lagged considerably behind that of O157:H7 strains. This study characterized 91 VTEC O103:H2 strains from bovine and human sources and of North American and European origins by virulence or putative virulence genes, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns, plasmid profiles, antimicrobial resistance, and colicin production. All strains were positive for vt1 and eae-epsilon; 97% were positive for ehxA; and all were negative for hlyA. Two strains carried vt2. There were 66 PFGE patterns grouped in six clusters, and there were 25 different plasmid profiles. Plasmid-encoded katP and etp genes were significantly more frequent in European than in North American human strains. The distribution of selected phenotypes was as follows: enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) hemolysin, 95%; colicin production, 38%; antimicrobial resistance, 58%. All the strains were negative for the alpha-hemolytic phenotype. In conclusion, the VTEC O103:H2 strains were diverse, as shown by PFGE, plasmid profiles, virulence markers, and antimicrobial resistance patterns, and all strains showed an EHEC hemolytic phenotype instead of the alpha-hemolytic phenotype that has been shown previously.
