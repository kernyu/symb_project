UNLABELLED: The aims of this study were to determine the association and potential mechanisms between TNF-antagonists and increased cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Three groups of RA patients were studied; ten treated with TNF-antagonists, 13 with methotrexate, and 14 were naive to treatment. Mean age: 47.2 (SD 11.3), 52.3 (SD 16.6), and 51.2 (SD 13.3) years; mean disease duration 102 (SD 90.4), 72.9 (SD 67.3), and 71.3 (SD 87.1) months, and treatment duration 24.2 (SD 18.5), 34.7 (SD 32.2), and 0 months for each group. CLINICAL DATA: systolic and diastolic blood pressure and body mass index were assessed. Disease activity was determined by DAS-28 index. An ELISA assay for IL-6, sIL-6 R, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, sTNFRI, sTNFRII, IGF I, and adiponectin were performed. Fasting glucose, insulin, lipid profile, CRP, and ESR were also done. HOMA-IR and QUICKI indexes were calculated. Statistically significant differences observed between the TNF group and the other two groups were: TNF-alpha levels (p, 0.0014), soluble TNF RII (p, 0.0432), IFN-gamma (p, 0.008), and DAS-28 <2.6 (p, 0.033). Finding of elevated levels of sTNFRII and IFN-gamma in patients with RA on anti-TNF suggests that this therapy does not completely suppress the inflammatory process and may promote atherogenesis.
