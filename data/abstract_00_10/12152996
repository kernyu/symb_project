Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog with antitumor activity against solid tumor malignancies and leukemia. We evaluated its activity as a single agent and combining it with cisplatin in relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Sixteen patients with advanced MM received intravenous gemcitabine 1250 mg/mq (days 1, 8 and 15) as a single agent for a total of 3 monthly courses. The responders received another three courses, and the non-responders received three courses of gemcitabine 1000 mg/mq (days 1, 8 and 15) plus cisplatin 80 mg/mq (day 1). No grade 4 hematological toxicity was seen after gemcitabine treatment, whereas > or = 3 grade neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were seen in 21 and 13% of the gemcitabine-cisplatin infusions, respectively. Non-hematological toxicity was negligible for both the regimens. After three courses of gemcitabine as a single agent, th e response rate was 31% (1 complete response, 1 partial response and 3 minimal response). Eight patients (50%) achieved stable disease and 3 (19%) had disease progression. Ten patients received gemcitabine-cisplatin and were evaluable for the response. Two patients progressed, four maintained stable disease whereas four patients, unresponsive to gemcitabine, obtained a response (3 partial response and 1 minimal response). With a median follow-up of 13 months (range 8-17.5), 7 patients (44%) died, 5 (31%) had disease progression, 1 (6%) relapsed, 1 was still in partial response (+11 months) and 2 (13%) had a stable disease. Median time to treatment failure (TTF) was 8 months (CI95%: 7.6-8.4) and median overall survival (OS) was 16 months (CI95%: 10-22). These results showed that gemcitabine and gemcitabine-cisplatin were feasible regimens and well tolerated in advanced relapsed-refractory MM. The response rates, the TTF and OS were similar to other salvage chemotherapy regimens; nevertheless, the quality of response was modest particularly after gemcitabine alone. Better results might be obtained combining gemcitabine with other chemotherapy compounds or with biologically based therapies.
