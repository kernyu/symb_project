A carbapenem-resistant isolate of Escherichia coli was identified that possessed a 23-kb plasmid encoding Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase type 2 (KPC-2). A subsequent surveillance study involving hospitals in Brooklyn, New York, revealed that, among 1417 E. coli isolates, 7 isolates (from 3 hospitals) possessed bla(KPC-2). E. coli possessing KPC-2 is emerging in our region, and improved methods for detection are urgently needed.
