Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were generally isolated from human beings; these agents were recently isolated from various animal species. It has been shown that MRSA isolates are not only resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, but can also be resistant to the other commonly used antibiotics. In this study, 18 phenotypic methicillin resistant S. aureus isolates from bovine mastitis cases were analyzed by PCR for the presence of mecA gene encoding methicillin resistance and aac (6')/aph(2''), aph(3')-IIIa and ant(4')-Ia genes encoding aminoglycoside resistance. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates (oxacillin MICs, >/=4 mug/ml), 3 were positive for mecA gene. Only one from 3 mecA positive isolates was positive for genes encoding aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and this isolate carried aac(6')/aph(2'') in combination with aph(3')-IIIa gene. The aph(3')-IIIa gene was detected in 3 isolates. These three isolates carrying the aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme genes were resistant to gentamicin, kanamycin and neomycin. The mecA gene of 3 MRSA isolates was sequenced. All three mecA genes of these isolates were identical to that found in human MRSA strains, except a one-base substitution at nucleotide position 757. From the data presented in this study, it can be concluded that MRSA isolated from bovine mastitis may be originated from human beings, but further studies are needed to investigate the possibility of zoonotic transfer of MRSA.
