Hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) is used as a neutral excipient in microbicides used against sexually transmitted pathogens. However, HEC inhibits the infection of cervical epithelial cells by Chlamydia trachomatis at pH 5 in a concentration-dependent manner. At pH 7, infection is inversely dependent on the concentration of HEC, possibly due to pH-dependent calcium sequestration.
