The antimicrobial susceptibility test was necessary for the eradication therapy of Helicobacter pylori infections. This is because, clarithromycin resistant strains has became an increasing problem. In this study, we used the antimicrobial susceptibility test which was compare with the agar gradient method, Etest, and broth microdilution method (dry plate) with 4 antimicrobial agents. The results strongly suggested that broth microdilution method was the best method in order to test the antimicrobial susceptibility of H. pylori. On the other hand, 393 H. pylori stains isolated during 1994-1998 from clinical patients were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility test to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and minomycin. There were no resistant strains to amoxicillin and minomycin. But clarithromycin and Metronidazole resistant strains were recognized in 85 (22.0%) and 36 (21.7%) strains.
