A variety of amino acid substitutions in the protease and Gag proteins have been reported to contribute to the development of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resistance to protease inhibitors. In the present study, full-length molecular infectious HIV-1 clones were generated by using HIV-1 variants isolated from heavily drug-experienced and therapy-failed AIDS patients. Of six full-length infectious clones generated, four were found to have unique insertions (TGNS, SQVN, AQQA, SRPE, APP, and/or PTAPPA) near the p17/p24 and p1/p6 Gag cleavage sites, in addition to the known resistance-related multiple amino acid substitutions within the protease. The addition of such Gag inserts mostly compromised the replication of wild-type HIV-1, whereas the primary multidrug-resistant HIV infectious clones containing inserts replicated significantly better than those modified to lack the inserts. Western blot analyses revealed that the processing of Gag proteins by wild-type protease was impaired by the presence of the inserts, whereas that by mutant protease was substantially improved. The present study represents the first report clearly demonstrating that the inserts seen in the proximity of the Gag cleavage sites in highly multi-PI resistant HIV-1 variants restore the otherwise compromised enzymatic activity of mutant protease, enabling the multi-PI-resistant HIV-1 variants to remain replication competent.
