The susceptibility to levofloxacin of 194 consecutive staphylococcal (45 Staphylococcus aureus and 149 coagulase-negative staphylococci) isolates from neutropenic patients was determined by Etest and the results compared with those obtained using NCCLS-methods (broth microdilution, agar dilution and disk diffusion). Overall agreement at +/- 1log(2) dilution for Etest compared with broth microdilution and agar dilution was 99.0 and 83.5%, respectively. The Etest category agreement with broth microdilution and disk diffusion was 95.9 and 89.7%, respectively. Comparison of categories with Etest and agar dilution method gave only 67.0% absolute categorical agreement, with 29.9% minor errors and 10.7% major errors. No very major errors occurred by the four methods tested. Our results show that Etest is a valid alternative to the reference NCCLS-methods for monitoring the clinical usefulness of levofloxacin against staphylococci isolates from neutropenic patients.
