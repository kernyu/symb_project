P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a multidrug transporter responsible for resistance to anticancer chemotherapy and physiologically involved in absorption, distribution, and excretion of a large number of hydrophobic xenobiotics. P-gp exhibits both an ATPase activity correlated with its drug transport function and a basal ATPase activity in the absence of any drug. We have developed a high-throughput screening test to detect specific interactions between drugs and P-gp. We took into account the existence of multiple binding sites on P-gp to propose and validate an optimized strategy, based on the modulation of the basal ATPase activity of P-gp and of the ATPase activity stimulated by three reference substrates (verapamil, vinblastine, and progesterone). The ATPase activity measurements were performed on P-gp-containing membrane vesicles from actinomycin-D-selected hamster DC-3F lung fibroblasts by a spectrophotometric method based on continuous monitoring of ADP formation, regenerated in ATP by a coupled enzyme system. This assay may be performed on 96- or 384-well microtiter plates. When applying this ATPase assay to 41 compounds known from the literature for their interaction with P-gp, 95% of them were found to be positive, whereas only 78% were positive when considering solely the modulation of the basal activity.
