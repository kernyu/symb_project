The usefulness of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections has been investigated since these agents started being used in clinical practice. Newer compounds have increased in vitro activity against anaerobes, but clinically relevant susceptibility breakpoints for these bacteria have not been established. Pharmacodynamic analyses and corroboration by new data from clinical trials have enhanced our knowledge concerning the use of fluoroquinolones to treat selective anaerobic pathogens. These studies suggest that newer agents could be useful in the treatment of several types of mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections, including skin and soft-tissue, intra-abdominal, and respiratory infections. The major concerns with expanding the use of fluoroquinolones to treat anaerobic infections have been reports of increasing resistance in Bacteroides group isolates and the impact of these antibiotics on the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated disease.
