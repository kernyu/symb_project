The aim of the present study was to evaluate the needs for surveillance of invasive Gram-negative pathogens in Estonia. The antimicrobial susceptibility data of invasive isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci were collected in accordance with EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System) protocols. Despite the higher rate of Gram positive pathogens, their resistance to antimicrobials was low in contrast to the elevated resistance established for Gram negative pathogens. The higher resistance to antimicrobials was particularly associated with A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Also, the proportion of extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL)-producing strains was 23% among Klebsiella spp. and 3.6% among E. coli. The inclusion of invasive Gram negative pathogens in antimicrobial resistance surveillance provides useful information concerning local pathogen susceptibility, as well as for the empirical treatment of suspected infections.
