Pyronaridine, administered intramuscularly (im) to Swiss mice infected with the lethal multidrug-resistant Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis, was found to exert high blood schizontocidal activity. The efficacy of doses of pyronaridine ranging from 0.625 to 30 mg (base/kg) was evaluated using a 4 day treatment schedule (drug was administered at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hrs). It was found that doses of 2.5mg/ kg and higher protected animals completely from the lethal effects of the parasite. The same degree of protection was found when the treatment duration was reduced to 3 days. This study shows that pyronaridine is a potentially useful antimalarial drug that could be exploited for the control of multidrug-resistant malaria infection.
