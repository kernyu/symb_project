The aim of the article was the evaluation of the efficiency of decompression of biliary tracts and determination of optimal period of external draining. The biochemical rates of functional state of liver, dynamic of factors of humeral nonspecific defense in blood serum and bile, in 197 patients with obstructive jaundice were investigated. Concurrently, the dynamic of nonspecific defense reaction changes in infected hepatic bile, changes of amylase, pH, and bile hypertensia were studied. The obtained data are used to determine optimal period of external draining of biliary tracts. The investigation showed that early decompression of biliary tracts allows fast restore of the liver function. Restoration of natural resistance and their positive dynamic depends on the period of performance of external draining; to a lesser degree it depends on the method of performance.
