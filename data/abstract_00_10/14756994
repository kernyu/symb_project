Global or longer term epidemiology track the spread of clonal lineages, associated with hipervirulence or resistance or multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents. Therefore, the application of a molecular typing system for this purpose should produce data easily shared by different and geographically distant laboratories, as well as distinguish those clonal lineages even with low levels of variability accumulated in the genome.A marker based on the DNA sequence will produce objective results easily organized in data bases accessible by Internet. The application of a similar strategy that was used in the analysis of isoenzymes, by sequencing variable fragments of selected housekeeping genes, will allow obtaining a general view of the distribution of the clonal lineages and tracking their spread.
