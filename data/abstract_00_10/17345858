The effects of the liposome form of isoniazide (IN) and liposomes without IN on the growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis were studied. Fluorescent assay demonstrated that the fraction of liposomes that interacted with M. smegmatis amounted to 1-3%. It was shown that the IN efficiency in a liposomal form decreased depending on the liposome composition and concentration as compared with the IN in water solution. A preincubation of mycobacteria with liposomes led to a decrease in their sensitivity to IN. An analogous effect was observed when incubating M. smegmatis with oleic acid. It was postulated that the relative resistance of M. smegmatis to the antibiotic when using lipids as a carbon substrate appeared due to a change in the agent's metabolism and should be taken into account when testing in vitro the liposomal forms of antibiotics.
