Among 257 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae collected in Brooklyn, NY, 24% were found to possess bla(KPC). Clinical microbiology laboratories that used automated broth microdilution systems reported 15% of the KPC-possessing isolates as susceptible to imipenem. The imipenem MIC was found to be markedly affected by the inoculum. For accurate detection of KPC-possessing K. pneumoniae, particular attention should be paid to proper inoculum preparation for broth-based susceptibility methods. In addition, using ertapenem or meropenem for class reporting of carbapenem susceptibility will improve detection.
