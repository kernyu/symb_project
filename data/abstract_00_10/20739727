BACKGROUND: Conventional therapies (corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents or interferon-a) or newer compounds such imatinib are used specifically in subsets of hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES). However other therapies are still needed in this condition. OBJECTIVE: To review the novel therapies for HES discussing their advantages and shortcomings. METHODS AND RESULTS: Preclinical and clinical data on novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-IL -5 antibodies or anti-CD52 antibodies (alemtuzumab) are analysed. The former might represent appropriate options in case of imatinib resistance; the efficacy of anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies therapy is limited by the occurrence of rebound eosinophilia and alemtuzumab might be a promising anti-eosinophil therapy for all HES subsets. CONCLUSION: Some of the novel therapies might become appropriate therapeutic options for HES.
