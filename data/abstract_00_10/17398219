In an effort to increase appropriate prescribing of low-cost antimicrobials in the outpatient setting, an evidence-based guideline was created to identify situations when low-cost medications can be used. A literature search identified relevant clinical trials describing the efficacy of antimicrobials used in the outpatient setting. These were analyzed to identify low-cost medications defined as $15 or less. The information was put into guideline format that includes the level of evidence for recommending the drug and information about cost. Sixteen common infections and their treatments were included in the guideline. The efficacy data were similar for the low-cost and higher-cost antimicrobials for all infections included. We created a low-cost antimicrobial guideline for common infections treated in the outpatient setting. The treatment options have similar efficacy to higher cost medications. This guideline will serve as an information source for providers to help them rapidly determine the low-cost treatments for common infections. In addition, it can serve as a template for the development of similar guidelines in other therapeutic classes. These guidelines should be customized before implementation at other health care organizations, with consideration of local resistance patterns, drug availability and patient factors. The effect of guideline implementation on future prescribing habits and providers' opinions about availability of cost information and subsequent conversations with patients and prescribers of medications deserves further study.
