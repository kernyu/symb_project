Bacteria utilize multiple strategies to circumvent antibiotics, producing broad specificity exporters or enzymes that catalyze the modification of either antibiotics or their targets. A report in this issue of Structure provides the structural and catalytic mechanisms of LinB, an adenylyltransferase of E. faecium that confers resistance to the lincosamide antibiotic clindamycin.
