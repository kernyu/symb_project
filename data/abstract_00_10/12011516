To evaluate the susceptibility of a large number of strains to various antiseptics, we elaborated a simple, qualitative broth turbidity method in which we could quickly judge the efficacy visually. For this method, we prepared a modified neutralizer broth, consisting of trypticase soy broth containing 15% Tween 80, 1% soybean lecithin and 0.5% sodium thiosulfate. The susceptibilities of Serratia marcescens No. 26 to 4 antiseptics obtained from the turbidity method showed a good agreement with those obtained from the colony-counting method; the 4 antiseptics tested were povidone-iodine (PVP-I), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and alkyldiaminoethylglycine hydrochloride (AEG). Both PVP-I and BAC had complete efficacy in 0.5 min against all isolates tested [100 isolates of S. marcescens, 103 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 99 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 19 of Alcaligenes faecalis and 30 of A. xylosoxidans subsp. xylosoxydans (A. xylosoxydans)]. In contrast, the effectiveness of CHG was weak compared with PVP-I, BAC and AEG. Strong resistance against AEG was noted even after 3-min exposure in 1 isolate each of A. faecalis and A. xylosoxydans. It is concluded that the turbidity test is a simple and accurate method to evaluate susceptibility to various antiseptics and that it is suitable for a screening of a large number of strains. Among the 4 antiseptics tested, PVP-I and BAC showed a consistently high activity against all isolates, confirming PVP-I and BAC to be clinically useful antiseptics.
