Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is of great concern to clinicians. Patient outcome after infection is mainly dependent on the sensitivity of the bacterium to the agent used. We retrospectively studied 89 postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) patients with proven Escherichia coli peritonitis and investigated the clinical consequences of the E. coli resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate. Significantly increased mortality, days of ventilation and ICU stay were noted in the co-amoxicillin/clavulanate resistant group. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the sensitivity of E. coli to amoxicillin/clavulanate in the postoperative ICU setting has decreased in recent years. We can conclude that the current antibiotic regimen for the empirical treatment of ICU patients with peritonitis, as used in our hospital, needs to be changed. A switch, for instance, to ceftriaxone (Rocephin) in combination with metronidazole and gentamicin, instead of the present regimen of amoxicillin/clavulanate in combination with gentamicin, seems preferable.
