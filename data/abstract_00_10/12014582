Using macrophage scavenger receptor-A knockout (SRKO) mice, we examined the role of macrophage class A scavenger receptors (MRS-A) on the immune response and acquisition of host resistance against repeated infestation with Haemaphysalis longicornis. Except for one batch of nymphs that infested one of the SRKO (SR-/-) mice and showed no appreciable reduction in body weight, all the other groups of nymphs manifested significant decrease in body weight. Both SR-/- and wild type (SR+/+) mice showed a sustained increase in anti-tick antibody titers, but SR+/+ mice showed significantly higher titers. The IFN-gamma assayed in SR-/- mouse immune sera was substantially less compared with that in SR+/+ mice. Immune sera from SR-/- and SR+/+ mice recognized the 51 and 44 kDa, and 44 kDa proteins, respectively, of the salivary gland antigen. The difference in the level of anti-tick resistance manifested by both groups of mice may be influenced by less efficient trapping and processing of tick antigens by macrophages in mice lacking for the macrophage scavenger receptors, and consequently affected the cascade of Th1 and Th2 responses. We have thus obtained valuable data that strongly infer the role of MSR-A in enhancing host defense against repeated infestation with H. longicornis.
