BACKGROUND: Two-thirds of the 350 million people infected with chronic hepatitis B virus live in the Asia-Pacific region. AIM To compare the effects of adefovir dipivoxil therapy between Asian and Caucasian patients with chronic hepatitis B. METHODS: The safety and efficacy of 10 mg of adefovir dipivoxil was compared to placebo in 501 Asian (n = 259) or Caucasian (n = 242) HBeAg+ and HBeAg- chronic hepatitis B virus patients treated for 48 weeks in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. RESULTS: At week 48, histological improvement was observed in 60% and 56% of Caucasian and Asian patients, respectively. Change in serum hepatitis B virus DNA from baseline to week 48 for the adefovir dipivoxil-treated patients was -3.89 and -3.70 log(10) copies/mL in Caucasian and Asian patients, respectively, while 34 per cent of Caucasian patients and 39 per cent of Asian patients had undetectable serum hepatitis B virus DNA (<400 copies/mL) at week 48. The percentage of patients achieving alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization at week 48 was similar in both groups (Caucasian 64 per cent, Asian 63 per cent). No patients developed resistance through week 48. No differences in adverse events or grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were observed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in treatment response between Asians and Caucasians. Adefovir dipivoxil was well tolerated and no resistance developed up to week 48 in both racial groups.
