Increasing numbers of HIV-infected children are now reaching adulthood and young people account for 10% of new HIV diagnosis in the UK each year. This audit of young people attending specialist and generic HIV services in Inner London in 2006 (n=39) highlights the complex medical and psychosocial needs of this patient group: 63% were diagnosed with HIV because of poor health, 39% had received more than three antiretroviral regimens, 21% had resistance to two antiretroviral classes and 32% had significant mental health problems. In addition, 45% reported to be sexually active with poor uptake of contraception other than condoms and frequent non-disclosure of their HIV status to a sexual partner.
