Immunological tolerance can be achieved in animals by exposure of newborn to a foreign antigen. Depending on the dose and timing of the antigenic challenge, tolerance has been reported to result in clonal deletion, anergy or active suppression. In this latter case, regulatory T cells prevent autoimmunity by suppressing the reactivity of pathogenic self-reactive T cells. We have previously reported the generation of a neonatal, mercury-specific, and dominant tolerance to autoimmunity induced by mercury salts in rats. Chronic exposure to mercury salts can lead to SLE-like autoimmune responses, mediated by autoreactive CD4+ Th2 cells, that regulate and are followed by a resistant state mediated by protective CD8+ T cells. The aim of the study was to compare the resistance to the neonatal tolerance to mercury disease, and to further characterize the CD8+ T cells endowed with regulatory capacity in the neonatal tolerance model. We report here that resistance to mercury disease is long lasting and not mercury-specific, suggesting that different CD8+ T cells are involved in resistance and neonatal tolerance, and that regulatory CD8+ Tc1 cells generated in tolerance are required to control the CD8- cell population from developing Th2-mediated autoimmunity. Upon mercury recall, CD8+ CD45RC(high) T cells, that represent the Tc1 subset in the rat, expanded and were polarized towards IFNgamma production. Interestingly, identical results were obtained with the CD8+ CD25+T cell population. Substantial amounts of FasL gene expression were detected in CD8+ T lymphocytes upon recall with the tolerogen. AICD may be one of the regulatory mechanisms used by these regulatory CD8+ Tc1 cells that control neonatal tolerance to a Th2-mediated autoimmune disorder.
