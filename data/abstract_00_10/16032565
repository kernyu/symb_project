The rates of occurrence of metallo-beta-lactamase-mediated resistances in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and Serratia marcescens, among other gram-negative bacilli, have escalated since 2000, severely limiting treatment options in Asia, Europe, and Latin America to non-beta-lactam antimicrobial classes. Clinical isolates harboring metallo-beta-lactamases have also recently been reported in western Canada and in Texas, signaling the need for development of accurate diagnostic tests by clinical laboratories to detect their presence and for new, and more potent, antimicrobial agents.
