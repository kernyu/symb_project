The bloodsuckling abomasal parasite Haemonchus contortus is the most pathogenic worm in sheep and goats. High prevalences of anthelmintic-resistant isolates make H. contortus difficult to control. Detecting the most anaemic animals could support a targeted selective treatment approach. Leaving the rest of the flock untreated would generate a refuge for anthelmintic-sensitive parasites. South-African researchers tried the FAMACHA-Eye-Colour-Chart for anaemic sheep and goats with good success. Field studies, carried out in Northern Germany on naturally infected sheep and goats showed, that at a comparatively low prevalence of H. contortus the FAMACHA-test proved not being sufficient in detecting all animals with high fecal egg counts. Under these conditions there was no satisfying reliability to identify small ruminants for selective deworming only based on the FAMACHAEye-Colour-Test. But if not working hours are the limiting factor, the repeated score could support the selection of pale animals in need to be treated.
