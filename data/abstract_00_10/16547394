The clinical efficacy of Maeda's nomogram for vancomycin dosage adjustment was evaluated by comparison with a standard dosage regimen (package insert information: vancomycin dose reduced in elderly patients and patients with renal dysfunction, with Moellering's nomogram used for renal-dysfunction patients) in adult Japanese MRSA pneumonia patients. Using Maeda's nomogram, the vancomycin dose is fixed at 1,000 mg while the dosing interval is varied in accordance with individual creatinine clearance. Using a standard dosage regimen, 5 patients out of 27 (18.5%) achieved target plasma levels of vancomycin (25-40 microg/mL for peak and 5-15 microg/mL for trough) within 2-6 days. Using Maeda's nomogram, 38 patients out of 53 (71.7%) achieved target levels in that time. A higher clinical response (complete resolution of all signs and symptoms of MRSA infection) to vancomycin therapy was also obtained with Maeda's nomogram when evaluated approximately 2-weeks after discontinuation of vancomycin therapy (43.4% versus 18.5% for the standard regimen). In conclusion, the Maeda's nomogram regimen with a 1,000 mg vancomycin dose was shown to achieve target plasma levels of vancomycin at a higher rate and provide higher clinical efficacy in vancomycin therapy of MRSA pneumonia patients, as compared with the currently available standard dosage regimen.
