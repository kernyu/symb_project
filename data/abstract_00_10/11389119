The most prevalent macrolide resistance phenotype and genotype among pneumococcal isolates was the cMLSB phenotype [erm(B) or erm(B)/mef(A)] (91.3%). We studied the distribution of other resistance genes, tet(M), catpC194, aph3'-III, in these strains, seeing evolution at work in that some strains carried different combinations of resistance determinants. The most prevalent patterns associated with resistance to erythromycin [erm(B)] were resistance to tetracycline [tet(M)] and chloramphenicol (catpC194) (48.2%) or resistance to tetracycline [tet(M)] alone (42.2%). In our isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae there was a strong association of the erm(B) and tet(M) genes with Tn1545-related elements.
