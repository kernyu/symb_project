Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a threat to tuberculosis control programs and community health. This growing problem mirrors the increasing incidence of tuberculosis in general. Public health problems include the absence of early diagnosis and effective treatment. The real need is to identify tuberculosis patients far earlier, particularly those with drug-resistant strains, and to begin appropriate therapy, which is of the shortest possible duration with minimal risk of acquiring further drug resistance or permitting further transmission. This article will address the epidemic of drug resistance and discuss some of the inherent difficulties in the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. We highlight some of the controversies and new findings in this area, as well as future perspectives requiring more active interventions, in addition to new technology and developments.
