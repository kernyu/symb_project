OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an educational video could improve parent knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors about the appropriate use of oral antibiotics. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, controlled trial was conducted in an urban primary care clinic and a suburban pediatric practice. Parents were randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups. Parents in the intervention group were asked to view a 20-minute video, specifically developed for this project, over a 2-month period, and given a brochure about antibiotics. Parent knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors were assessed at the time of enrollment and then by telephone 2 months later. RESULTS: A total of 193 (94%) of 206 parents completed the study. The groups were equivalent with respect to all important baseline characteristics. No differences were found for adjusted posttest means between the intervention and control groups for knowledge, beliefs, or behavior. For example, the intervention group scored 8.04 on the knowledge questionnaire (11 true-false questions), compared with 7.82 for the control group. Subgroup analysis, based on site of enrollment, indicated that families in the intervention group from the primary care urban clinic improved their knowledge score (6.03 to 6.92) and were more likely to report that there were problems with children receiving too many antibiotics (intervention 67% vs control 34%). CONCLUSION: Overall, this video had only a modest effect on parent knowledge, beliefs, and self-reported behaviors regarding oral antibiotics. We believe that any campaign promoting the judicious use of oral antibiotics must use a multifaceted approach and target both parents and physicians.
