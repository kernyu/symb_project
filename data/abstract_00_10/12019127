The activities of therapeutic agents and myristamidopropyl dimethylamine (MAPD) against Acanthamoeba strains recalcitrant to medical therapy were studied. MAPD minimum cysticidal concentrations were 6.25 to 25 microg/ml; 10 to 30 microg/ml gave at least a 3-log cyst kill after 6 h, and 50 and 100 microg/ml gave at least a 3-log cyst kill within 2 and 1 h, respectively.
