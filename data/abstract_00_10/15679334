Utilizing high-throughput isolation, purification, and analysis methods applied to a natural products library, a new mass-limited antibacterial indolosesquiterpene, suaveolindole (1), was obtained from Greenwayodendron suaveolens. The miniaturization of the structure elucidation of 1 was performed primarily using the CapNMR probe. Compound 1 was found to possess significant in vitro antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 43223), Staphylococcus aureus (ATTC 6538P), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ATTC 33591), with MIC values of 4, 8, and 8 microg/mL, respectively.
