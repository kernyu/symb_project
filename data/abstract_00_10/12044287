The aim of this brief paper is to summarize the ways in which viruses develop resistance to currently licensed anti-viral drugs and to comment on their clinical relevance. Specific examples will be chosen to emphasize basic principles of the development of resistance and readers are referred elsewhere to a summary of resistance in HIV that follows the same principles.
