We describe the emergence of a new quinolone resistance pattern in Salmonella enterica isolates from Southeast Asia. These isolates are susceptible to nalidixic acid but exhibit reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. The increase of such strains may threaten the value of the nalidixic acid disk test to screen for reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility in salmonellas.
