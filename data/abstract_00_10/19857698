OBJECTIVE: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the common infection in simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 26 adult patients undergoing SPKT between September 2001 and December 2006. All the patients were followed prospectively for UTI during the first 4 weeks after surgery. Urine samples were investigated for bacteriologic cultures. The micro-organisms were identified in accordance with standard bacteriologic procedures. Susceptibility testing was carried out using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) procedures. RESULTS: Among 77 urine specimens obtained from all recipients during the first month, there were 30 isolated bacterial strains. The most common were Gram-positive bacteria (53.3%) with predominance of enterococci (75%) associated with high levels of aminoglycoside resistant strains (HLAR; 58.3%) and vancomycin-resistant strains (VRE; 25%). Gram-negative bacteria were detected in 46.7% of positive cultures. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, enterococci predominated as 75% of Gram-positive isolates. The increased proportion of multi-drug-resistant bacteria, which can caused severe UTI in patients after SPKT, may be due to the frequent use of prophylaxis of bacterial infections in patients.
