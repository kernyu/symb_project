We determined the activities of new antibiotics telithromycin (ketolide) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (streptogramins) against 88 macrolide and/or lincosamide resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) isolates with defined resistance gene status. Telithromycin susceptibility was determined only in erythromycin-sensitive isolates (15) indicating the same mechanisms of resistance. In contrast, all erythromycin-resistant isolates (73) were either constitutively resistant to telithromycin (13 isolates with constitutive erm genes) or demonstrated telithromycin D-shaped zone (60 isolates with inducible msr(A) and/or erm). However, the level of inducible resistance conferred by msr(A) (35 isolates) was borderline even after induction by erythromycin. No quinupristin/dalfopristin resistant isolate was observed if tested by disk-diffusion method (DDM) but 18 isolates were intermediate (MIC = 1-3 mg/L) and two isolates resistant (MIC = 8 mg/L) if tested by E-test. All these isolates were resistant to streptogramin A and harbored vga(A) gene (1 isolate) or vga(A)LC gene (19 isolates). MICs for quinupristin/dalfopristin were higher for isolates with combination of streptogramin A resistance and constitutive MLSB resistance (MIC = 3-8 mg/L in 4 isolates) than for streptogramin A-resistant isolates susceptible to streptogramin B (MIC = 0.5-2 mg/L in 16 isolates). In addition to S. haemolyticus, vga(A)LC was newly identified in S. epidermidis and S. warnerii indicating its widespread occurrence in CoNS. Misidentification of low-level resistant isolates by DDM may contribute to dissemination of streptogramin A resistance.
