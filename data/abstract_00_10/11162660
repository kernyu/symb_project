Cancer chemotherapy with taxol often fails due to acquired resistance of cancer cells, which is frequently associated with an overexpression of P-gp and alterations of beta-tubulin. A taxol-resistant cell line, QGY-TR50, derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) QGY-7703 cell line was used to investigate the mechanisms of taxol-resistance. QGY-TR50 cells showed more than 250-fold resistance to taxol and exhibited cross-resistance to other drugs including actinomycin D, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and vincristine. P-gp was highly expressed in QGY-TR50 cells. Expression levels of five human beta-tubulin isotypes (betaI-, betaII-,betaIII-, betaIva, and betaIvb-tubulin) were examined by real-time semi-quantitative PCR. Comparing with QGY-7703 cells, QGY-TR50 cells did not show any significant change in the expression levels of betaI-, betaIva, and betaIvb-tubulin. While a 1.2-fold increased in betaII-tubulin and a 0.5-fold decreased in betaIII-tubulin levels were observed. All results suggest that the P-glycoprotein could be one key factor involved in enhancing drug resistance in QGY-TR50 cells.
