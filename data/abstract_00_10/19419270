OBJECTIVE: To determine the rates of and risk factors for carriage and acquisition of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae during hospitalization. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Shaare Zedek Medical Center, a 550-bed teaching hospital. METHODS: During a 5-month period (February 1-June 30, 2004), 167 (8%) of 1,985 newly admitted general medical patients were enrolled in our study. Nasal, oropharyngeal, and rectal swab specimens were obtained at admission and every 2-3 days until hospital discharge or death. Enterobacteriaceae isolates were tested for ESBL, and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were tested for methicillin resistance. RESULTS: Of the 167 patients enrolled in our study, 15 (9%) were identified as nasal carriers of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) at admission, and 13 (8%) were rectal carriers of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae at admission. Univariate risk factors for rectal carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae included female sex (odds ratio [OR], 11 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.4-238]; P < .05), nursing home residence (OR, 6.9 [95% CI, 1.8-27]; P < .01), recent antibiotic treatment (OR, 9.8 [95% CI, 1.7-74]; P < .05), and concomitant nasal carriage of MRSA and/or ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (OR, 5.8 [95% CI, 1.2-26]; P < .01). Multivariate risk factors were female sex and recent antibiotic treatment. During hospitalization, 35 (21%) of 167 patients had acquired rectal carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (P = .002, for trend analysis). Of the 12 patients who were still in the hospital 2 weeks after admission, 4 (33%) were carriers of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Univariate risk factors for acquisition included an age of older than 65 years (P < .005), nursing home residence (OR 2.6, [95% CI, 0.98-2.6]), impaired cognition (OR, 4.8 [95% CI, 1.9-12]), recent antibiotic treatment (OR, 2.7 [95% CI, 0.9-8.3]), respiratory assistance (OR, 4.2 [95% CI, 1.2-14]), and prolonged hospitalization. Multivariate risk factors were an age of older than 65 years and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Rectal carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae occurred in 13 (8%) of 167 patients at admission to the medical departments of our hospital and in 4 (33%) of 12 patients still remaining in our hospital after 2 weeks.
