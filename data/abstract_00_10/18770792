Here is another unit with clinical relevance. Tuberculosis remains a major health problem throughout the world, with approximately one-quarter of the population being infected. Rapid and accurate susceptibility testing for the tubercle bacillus is essential for control of the disease. Such testing can be accomplished by flow cytometry within twenty-four hours, instead of the days to weeks required by traditional methods. The use of flow cytometry both improves the quality of susceptibility testing and advances public health measures for the prevention and control of this ancient scourge.
