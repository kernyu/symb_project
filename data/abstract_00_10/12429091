Cocrystal structures of Methanococcus jannaschii diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DAPDC) bound to a substrate analog, azelaic acid, and its L-lysine product have been determined at 2.6 A and 2.0 A, respectively. This PLP-dependent enzyme is responsible for the final step of L-lysine biosynthesis in bacteria and plays a role in beta-lactam antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Substrate specificity derives from recognition of the L-chiral center of diaminopimelate and a system of ionic "molecular rulers" that dictate substrate length. A coupled-enzyme assay system permitted measurement of kinetic parameters for recombinant DAPDCs and inhibition constants (K(i)) for azelaic acid (89 microM) and other substrate analogs. Implications for rational design of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents targeted against DAPDCs of drug-resistant strains of bacterial pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, are discussed.
