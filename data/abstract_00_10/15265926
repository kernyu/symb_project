Wheat gluten causes gut inflammation in genetically predisposed individuals. We tested the hypothesis that wheat gluten is not only a target of adaptive immunity, but also modulates the function of APC. Dendritic cells (DC) derived from the bone marrow of BALB/c mice were exposed to chymotrypsin-treated wheat gluten. This induced DC maturation as estimated by all surface markers tested (MHC class II, CD40, CD54, and CD86). The effect was dose dependent, and, at 100 microg/ml gluten matched that caused by 10 ng/ml LPS. A role of endotoxin contamination was ruled out by demonstrating the resistance of wheat gluten effects to LPS antagonist polymyxin B. DC from LPS nonresponder strain C3H/HeJ were affected by wheat gluten, but not by LPS. Proteinase K-digested wheat gluten was unable to stimulate DC maturation. Wheat gluten induced a unique secretion pattern of selected cytokines and chemokines in DC. Classic pro- or anti-inflammatory mediators were not produced, in contrast to LPS. Rather, chemokines MIP-2 and keratinocyte-derived cytokine were secreted in large amounts. We conclude that wheat gluten lowers the threshold for immune responses by causing maturation of APC, by attracting leukocytes and increasing their reactivity state. In the presence of an appropriate genetic predisposition, this is expected to increase the risk of adverse immune reactions to wheat gluten or to other Ags presented.
