UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE/OBJECTIVE: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was approved in the US in 2001 and a few months later by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency for use in the EU, initially for treatment-experienced HIV patients with early virological failure. The following year the HIV indication was expanded to include antiretroviral treatment naive adults over 18 years of age. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing clinical trials of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate's safety and efficacy have confirmed its position as a long-term, safe, effective and convenient backbone component in combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected patients. With its favourable resistance profile, it is also an option for treatment-experienced patients. This article describes the efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate from ongoing and recent clinical trials, and key aspects of its broad, clinical experience since its introduction.
