Fifty-two healthy adult male and female volunteers were enrolled in this double-blind study to determine the maximum tolerated dose, characterize the pharmacokinetics, and obtain serum bactericidal activity (SBA) data for intravenous dalbavancin. Subjects were assigned to single- or multiple-dose groups and randomized to receive dalbavancin or placebo intravenously over 30 min. Doses started at 140 mg in the single-dose group and with a 300-mg loading dose (LD), followed by six daily 30-mg maintenance doses (MDs), in the multiple-dose cohort and escalated to a 1120-mg single dose and a 1000-mg LD and 100-mg MD regimen. Plasma, urine, and skin blister fluid aspirate drug concentrations were measured, and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined via noncompartmental methods. SBA against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was determined at several time points. Adverse events and changes from the baseline for laboratory data, electrocardiograms, audiologic assessments, physical examinations, and vital signs were assessed. Concentrations increased in proportion to the dose. Steady-state concentrations were achieved by day 3 with the 10:1 LD-MD regimen. The half-life averaged 181 h, and the mean volume of distribution and clearance were 9.75 liters and 0.0473 liters/h, respectively. Mean values were similar in all groups and in males and females. The portion of the dose excreted renally averaged 33.5%. Bactericidal activity was demonstrated in serum at 7 days in all subjects receiving single doses of >or=500 mg. All doses were well tolerated. Dose-limiting toxicity was not encountered. No changes in auditory or vestibular function occurred. The long half-life and maintenance of SBA against MRSA for 1 week suggest that weekly dosing may be feasible.
