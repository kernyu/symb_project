In this study the role of the TOP2 gene in fungal drug susceptibility was investigated by disrupting and overexpressing the gene in Candida albicans. MIC determination and a spot assay showed that a top2Delta/Delta null mutant (strain T2bc) was more resistant to the antifungals tested than the wild-type (strain CAI4). Real-time RT-PCR and rhodamine 6G efflux examination showed that TOP2 did not influence the activity of drug efflux pumps. Sterol analysis with GC/high-resolution MS indicated that the intracellular ergosterol composition of the top2Delta/Delta mutant was significantly increased. Subsequently, fluorescence polarization measurements also revealed that Top2-deprived cells displayed a decrease in membrane fluidity, resulting in enhanced passive diffusion of the drugs. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis further confirmed that the ERG11 gene, an essential gene in ergosterol biosynthesis, was upregulated. These results demonstrate a close relationship between the TOP2 gene and drug susceptibility in C. albicans.
