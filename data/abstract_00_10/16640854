OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of floxuridine, actinomycin D, etoposide, vincristine (FAEV) regimen in treatment of high-risk drug-resistant gestational trophoblastic tumor (GTT). METHODS: From October 2001 to May 2004, 11 cases of high-risk drug-resistant GTT were treated with FAEV regimen. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) prognosis score (2000) was 7 to 13 (median 9). All patients were referred to Peking Union Medical College Hospital because of failure of chemotherapy previously. After the FAEV treatment, they were followed up for 15 to 42 months. RESULTS: Seven cases (64%, 7/11) were cured by FAEV regimen. The median treatment course for serum human chorionic gonadotropin reaching normal level was 3. Four cases (36%, 4/11) showed drug-resistant to FAEV regimen. The major side effect of FAEV regimen was myelosuppression. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor support was needed after 98% (63/64) of the courses. CONCLUSION: For those high-risk drug-resistant GTT cases, FAEV regimen could be considered as an effective choice of treatment.
