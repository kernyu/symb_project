Probiotic bacteria and starter cultures of Lactobacillus, Weissella and Bifidobacterium of African and European origins were studied and compared for their susceptibility to antimicrobials. The study included, for all isolates, determination of MICs (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration) for 24 antimicrobials, detection of resistance genes by PCR reactions using specific primers and sequencing of positive amplicons. The ability of Lb. reuteri from Africa to transfer the erythromycin resistance gene erm(B) to closely related bacteria was investigated by conjugation. Variations were observed and high levels of intrinsic resistance were found among the tested species. Positive amplicons were obtained for resistance genes encoding aminoglycoside (aph(3')-III, aadA, aadE) and tetracycline (tet(S)) from isolates from Europe and macrolide (erm(B)) from an isolate from Africa. However, only the erm(B) gene found in Lb. reuteri L4: 12002 from Africa contained a homologous sequence to previously published sequences. This gene could be transferred in vitro to enterococci. Higher prevalence of phenotypic resistance for aminoglycoside was found in isolates from Europe.
