Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is one of the most frequently encountered ocular disorders in primary care. It is frequently self-limiting, and the widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has led to concerns regarding antibiotic resistance. Therefore, a Cochrane systematic review of 5 randomised clinical trials that compared antibiotic treatment with placebo in patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis was recently updated. The chances of clinical and microbiological benefits of topical antibiotics were small but statistically significantly higher compared with placebo in the early stage (2 to 5 days after the first day of the intervention) and late stage (6 to 10 days after the first day of the intervention). The risk of adverse events in patients treated with placebo appeared to be low. Future trials should assess the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for acute bacterial conjunctivitis.
