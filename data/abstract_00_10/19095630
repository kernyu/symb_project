OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and virological response to lopinavir/ritonavir containing second-line therapy after failing a first line nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) based regimen. DESIGN: Prospective 36 months cohort study of patients switched to zidovudine/stavudine plus didanosine plus lopinavir/ritonavir capsules as second-line regimen. METHODOLOGY: Structured interview, medical examination, and laboratory assessment performed every 6 months. RESULTS: We enrolled 40 patients; 1 died and 3 were lost to follow-up. Median CD4+ count at baseline was 108 cell/microL, median log viral load was 4.8 copies/mL. Sixteen (40%) patients had baseline genotypic resistant test, 14 (87%) had lamivudine resistance mutations, and all had NNRTIs resistance mutations. At month 36, 82% of the patients achieved viral suppression (<400 copies/ mL) and the median increase in CD4+ count was 214 cell/microL, (interquartile range: 128-295). Twenty-five patients (62%) experienced at least one adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms lopinavir/ ritonavir-based second-line regimen but with a high rate of toxicities.
