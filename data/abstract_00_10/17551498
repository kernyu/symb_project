Xanafide, a DNA-intercalating agent and topoisomerase II inhibitor, has previously demonstrated comparable cytotoxicity to the parent drug amonafide (NSC 308847). The current study was conducted to investigate further the anti-proliferative effects of xanafide in human breast cancer cell lines, in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro activity of xanafide against MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, SKBR-3 and T47D cell lines was compared to that of paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine and doxorubicin. In MCF-7, xanafide demonstrated comparable total growth inhibition (TGI) concentrations to the taxanes and lower TGI values than gemcitabine, vinorelbine and doxorubicin. MCF-7 (oestrogen receptor (ER)+/p53 wild-type) was the most sensitive cell line to xanafide. MDA-MB-231 and SKBR-3 exhibited similar sensitivity to xanafide. T47 D (ER+/p53 mutated), showed no response to this agent. The in vivo activity of xanafide was further compared to that of docetaxel in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines using the hollow fibre assay. Xanafide was slightly more potent than docetaxel, at its highest dose in MCF-7 cell line, whereas docetaxel was more effective than xanafide in MDA-MB-231 cell line. Our results show that there is no relationship between sensitivity of these cell lines to xanafide and cellular levels of both isoforms of topoisomerase II and suggest that ER and p53 status and their crosstalk may predict the responsiveness or resistance of breast cancer patients to xanafide.
