AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the staphylococcal flora associated with wild turkey populations. METHODS AND RESULTS: Faecal samples obtained from 26 wild turkeys over a 16-month period were inoculated onto mannitol salt agar plates to select for staphylococci. Fifty-seven randomly chosen isolates were identified as Staphylococcus lentus and their susceptibility determined against clindamycin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, oxacillin, penicillin G, rifampin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. Resistance was minimal as only 3 isolates showed resistance to clindamycin, 3 isolates were resistant to oxacillin, 3 isolates were resistant to penicillin G, and 1 isolate was resistant to erythromycin. Multiple antibiotic resistance was also minimal. CONCLUSIONS: S. lentus is the predominant staphylococcal species associated with wild turkey faeces and antibiotic resistance in these organisms is not problematic. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: S. lentus has been shown as a potential causative agent of inflammatory reactions in the respiratory tract. Due to increased numbers of wild turkeys and more frequent human exposure, surveys to monitor microbial populations are warranted.
