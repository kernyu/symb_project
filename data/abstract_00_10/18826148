OBJECTIVE: To compare the antimicrobial activities of Scutellaria baicalensis and Baicalin against Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in vitro. METHODS: The crude alcohol extraction of Scutellaria baicalensis was obtained by successive extractions with ethanol. Baicalin was extracted by using organic extraction methods and the purity was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The crude alcohol extraction of Scutellaria baicalensis and Baicalin were used in broth dilution assays to test for antibacterial properties. RESULTS: The content of Baicalin was 5.01 g from 100 g Scutellaria baicalensis. The purity of Baicalin was 96.8%. The crude alcohol extraction of Scutellaria baicalensis and Baicalin were tested for their ability to inhibit H. pylori in vitro by using broth dilution assays. The MIC50 and MIC90 of Baicalin against ten strains of H. pylori were 1.04 and 1.30 mg/ml respectively. The MIC50 and MIC90 of the crude product against ten strains of H. pylori were 2.60 and 3.26 mg/ml respectively. CONCLUSION: The Baicalin and Scutellaria baicalensis are bactericidal against H. pylori. The antimicrobial activity of Baicalin is greater than that of Scutellaria baicalensis.
