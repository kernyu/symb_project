Pulsed-field gel electrophoretic analysis of 2,144 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains isolated from patients in Spanish hospitals over a 7-year period revealed 17 predominant profiles. Typing showed the replacement of Iberian clone E1 (ST247-MRSA-I) by two prevalent clones, E7 and E8, that are closely related to each other and have the same genetic background as ST125-MRSA-IV.
