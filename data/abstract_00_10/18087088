PURPOSE: To assess the pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility profile of Helicobacter pylori isolates from patients with gastritis, duodenal ulcer (DU) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) residing in Shiraz, Iran. METHODS: One hundred and six H. pylori isolates from patients with gastritis, DU and GERD undergoing endoscopy at our university hospitals and clinics were analysed for their antimicrobial susceptibility to metronidazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and furazolidone. The minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution method. RESULTS: Overall H. pylori resistance rate was 72.6% to metronidazole, 9.4% to clarithromycin and furazolidone, 20.8% to amoxicillin and 4.7% to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. No resistance to co-amoxiclav was detected among H. pylori isolates. No significant differences between antimicrobial resistance and clinical outcome were detected. CONCLUSIONS: With regard to the increasing resistance of H. pylori isolates to various antibiotics, susceptibility testing of H. pylori isolates prior to the treatment of infection must be performed to achieve better eradication and to reduce the risk of selection of H. pylori resistant strains.
