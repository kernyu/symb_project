Ganciclovir (GCV) resistance is an emerging problem for transplant recipients. A sensitive and rapid real-time PCR approach for simultaneous and semiquantitative detection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL97 mutations in codons 460/520 was established by LightCycler and confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing. Results from HCMV laboratory strains were compared with results from 11 GCV-resistant clinical isolates.
