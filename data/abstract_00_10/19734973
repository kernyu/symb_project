Quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae rates have increased worldwide since 1994. The objective of this study was to appraise: (i) the antimicrobial susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in a venereology clinic in Paris, between 2005 and 2007; and (ii) the factors associated with quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. A prospective study of consecutive cases was performed for the period 2005 to 2007. Susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to five antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, spectinomycin, penicillin G and tetracycline) was tested systematically. Clinical and epidemiological data were collected using a standardized form. Male-to-female sex ratio was 22.0. Median age was 30.0 years. Of 115 cases, 84 occurred in men having sex with men (72.6%) and 22 involved the anorectal area (19.1%). The rate of quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae was 37.4% (43/115), without significant association with gender, age, sexual behaviour, past history of sexually transmitted diseases and susceptibility to other antibiotics. All N. gonorrhoeae were susceptible to ceftriaxone and spectinomycin. The rate of quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae in Paris has been increasing since 2004. Ceftriaxone remains the gold standard treatment.
