Bacterial drug resistance is emerging as one of the most significant challenges to human health. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are produced by many tissues and cell types of invertebrates, insects, and humans, as part of their innate immune system, have attracted considerable interest as alternative antibiotics. Interest in novel mimics of AMPs has increased greatly over the last few years. This report details a new AMP mimic, based on phenylene ethynylene, with improved antimicrobial activity and selectivity. Screening against a large set of bacterial and other organisms demonstrates broad spectrum antimicrobial activity including activity against antibiotic resistant bacterial like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) as well as activity against yeast (Candida albicans) and fungus (Stachybotrys chartarum). Bacterial resistance development studies using Staphylococcus aureus show a rapid increase in MIC for conventional antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. In sharp contrast, no change in MIC was observed for the AMP mimic. Cytotoxicity experiments show that the AMP mimic acts preferentially on microbes as opposed to mammalian red blood cells, 3T3 fibroblasts, and HEPG2 cells. In vivo experiments determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to be 10 mg/kg suggesting a therapeutic window is available. These studies indicate that nonpeptidic amphiphilic AMP mimics could be developed as potential new treatments for antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.
