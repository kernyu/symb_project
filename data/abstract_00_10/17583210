The definition of the term "biofilm" and the validity of the analogy between these structured microbial communities and multicellular organisms are discussed in the review. The mechanisms of biofilm formation, the types of interrelations of the components of biofilms, and the reasons for biofilm resistance to biocides and stress factors are considered in detail. The role of biofilms in microbial ecology and in biotechnology is discussed.
