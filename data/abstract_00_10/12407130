Burkholderia pseudomallei produces an Ambler class A beta-lactamase, known as BPS-1. The beta-lactamase gene from a laboratory-derived, ceftazidime-resistant strain of B. pseudomallei (LH-1-2) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The beta-lactamase, named BPS-1m, had an identical isoelectric focusing point (pI 7.7) to that of BPS-1, but differed in having a stronger hydrolytic activity against ceftazidime. Susceptibility testing showed that BPS-1m when expressed in E. coli conferred resistance to ceftazidime (MIC >or= 32 mg/L). The amino acid sequence of BPS-1m differed from that of BPS-1 by a Pro-to-Ser change at position 167 in the omega loop.
