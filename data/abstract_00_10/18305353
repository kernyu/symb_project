Cyslabdan produced by Streptomyces sp. K04-0144 was found to potentiate imipenem activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The MIC value of imipenem against MRSA was reduced from 16 to 0.015 microg/ml in combination with cyslabdan. Study on anti-MRSA activity of other typical antibiotics in combination with cyslabdan showed that the potentiating activity was limited to beta-lactam antibiotics. Furthermore, among beta-lactam antibiotics, the activity of carbapenems was most remarkably potentiated by cyslabdan.
