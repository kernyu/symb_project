Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was unexpectedly isolated from a pig used for streptozotocin-induced diabetes research. To investigate the possible source of the MRSA isolate, nasal swabs were obtained from the animal herd, and from animal holding rooms, and veterinary and research staff involved in the handling of the animals. Overall, four MRSA isolates were cultured from three pigs and from a clinician/scientist. Two were ST22-MRSA-IV, a human strain type associated with epidemic spread. The other two were ST398-MRSA-V, a strain type associated with pigs. Thus, care should be taken to prevent cross-transmission of MRSA.
