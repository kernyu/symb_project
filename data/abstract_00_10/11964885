The prevalence of fungal infections has increased significantly over the past few decades. Candida and Aspergillus spp. are the most common fungal pathogens due to recent changes in medical technology. Amphotericin B continues to be the treatment of choice in many severe disseminated mycosis cases, but problems with toxicity, resistance and non-availability of an absorbable oral form are important drawbacks. The azoles offer a less toxic alternative but often they are not as effective as amphotericin B and resistance is an increasing problem. The echinocandins are new active antifungal agents with a novel mechanism of action. During the past year, one agent has been released and two others are undergoing advanced stages of investigation. Although these agents are not the ideal antifungal drug, they do offer new options of therapy.
