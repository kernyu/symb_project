From a library of 61 compounds available from former studies 2,5-bis-acylaminobenzophenone 7p was identified as a lead structure for a novel class of anti-malaria agents active against multi-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strain Dd2. Some structural modifications of this initial lead demonstrated the potential for further improvement of the anti-plasmodial activity of this novel class of anti-malarials.
