Induced disease resistance of plants is often associated with an enhanced capacity to activate cellular defense responses to pathogen attack, named the "primed" state of the plant. Exopolysaccharides of Pantoea agglomerans have recently been reported as the first priming active component of bacterial origin in wheat cells. We now show that Pantoea exopolysaccharides also prime rice cells for better elicitation of a rapid oxidative burst. In contrast, in tobacco and parsley cell cultures Pantoea exopolysaccharides activate the oxidative burst response directly. Our results point to a different recognition and/or mode of action of Pantoea exopolysaccharides in monocot and dicot plants.
