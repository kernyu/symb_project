BACKGROUND: The widespread use of eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori in Japan has led to an increase in antibiotic-resistant strains and the problem of re-treatment in cases of eradication failure. AIM: To perform drug sensitivity testing for metronidazole in 92 H. pylori-positive patients who had failed eradication treatment with first-line triple therapy, consisting of a proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin and clarithromycin, and were administered metronidazole-containing second-line therapy. METHODS: Second-line eradication therapy, consisting of rabeprazole (20 mg b.d.), amoxicillin (750 mg b.d.) and metronidazole (250 mg b.d.), was administered for 1 week and the eradication rates and influence of metronidazole resistance were determined. RESULTS: The eradication rates for rabeprazole-amoxicillin-metronidazole were 88% (81/92) using intention-to-treat analysis and 91% (81/89) using per protocol analysis. The eradication rates were 97% (61/63) for metronidazole-sensitive strains and 82% (18/22) for metronidazole-resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: As second-line H. pylori eradication treatment in Japan, rabeprazole-amoxicillin-metronidazole triple therapy is effective, even with metronidazole-resistant strains.
