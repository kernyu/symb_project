Genotypes and putative genetic relationships were characterised for epidemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (EMRSA) strains and isolates from England and Wales, using a high resolution DNA fingerprinting technique, fluorescent amplified-fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP). Each of the phage types of EMRSA had a distinct FAFLP profile. The technique revealed clusters of strains and isolates, and could distinguish isolates belonging to the same phage type. FAFLP provides a new approach to the epidemiological study and control of MRSA.
