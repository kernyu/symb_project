Lysozyme-glucose stearic acid monoester (HEL-GE) conjugate was prepared through the Maillard reaction as an antibacterial emulsifier. The molar ratio of GE to HEL was 1:1. The isoelectric point was 6-7, which is lower than that of native HEL. Spectroscopic studies indicated that the alpha-helix content was slightly lower but the conformation around Trp had not changed and that the surface of the conjugate was covered with the GE moiety. The conjugate maintained approximately 53-57% of the enzymatic activity of native HEL at 40-60 degrees C and exhibited considerable resistance to proteolysis. The denaturation temperature of the conjugate was approximately 74 degrees C, somewhat higher than that of control HEL, whereas the enthalpy was about one-third of that of control HEL. The emulsifying activity of the conjugate and the emulsion stability were much enhanced compared to those of native HEL, and the conjugate maintained approximately 70% of the bactericidal activity.
