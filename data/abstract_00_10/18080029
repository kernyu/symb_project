The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and attitude of the doctors who attend patients with community-acquired infections and who are responsible for most of the antibiotic prescriptions in primary health care. At the same time, the evolution experienced in the last ten years in relation to the main parameters analyzed was studied. The study was conducted by personal interviews, using a structured questionnaire, administered to 855 doctors of different specialties, who make up a statistically significant nationwide sample. The study showed that in spite of the improvements in the knowledge of the microbiology of infectious diseases and the choice of antimicrobial agents, there are still certain areas that need improvement. These are, above all, in regard to the bacterial resistance problem, underevaluation of the viral etiology of certain respiratory tract infections and the somewhat condescending attitude with "visits by third parties", indulgence prescriptions and therapeutic noncompliance. Efficacy defined not only as clinical remission but also, and essentially, as antibacterial coverage, are the main parameters considered when participating physicians choose an antibiotic.
