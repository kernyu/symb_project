With the increasing availability of new agents, selection of fluoroquinolones for formulary inclusion can be difficult. Appropriate evaluation of the important characteristics (pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, antimicrobial activity, efficacy, tolerability, cost) of these agents should allow selection of the most cost-effective ones. Evidence from in vitro studies and clinical trials indicates differences exist among fluoroquinolones, especially in terms of activity against gram-positive, aerobic organisms. For selected clinical situations, it may be important to choose an agent that is available in both intravenous and oral formulations. Comparative drug costs, as well as costs associated with potential clinical failure and adverse events, should be evaluated carefully. Dosage regimens should be considered, as shorter durations of therapy and less frequent dose administration may lead to reduced labor costs and increased patient compliance, thereby improving effectiveness and economic efficiency.
