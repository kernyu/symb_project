Multiple clinical trials have been undertaken during last years to assess indications, efficiency and safety of glomerulonephritis treatment with new immunosuppressive drugs as cyclosporine (CsA, Mycophenolate Mophetil (MMF) and Tacrolimus (FK 506). The main indication for cyclosporine is nephrotic syndrome resistance to steroids and cytotoxic agents, steroid-dependent and multi-relapsing cases with serious toxic side effects or with contraindications for steroids and cytotoxic drugs. CsA was administered at the dose of 4-5 mg/kg/day in adults and 5-6 mg/kg/day in children. The best results were achieved with minimal change disease. The durable remission occurred in 70-80% of cases of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome and in 20-30% of steroid-resistant forms. There was a lower rate of remission and a high risk of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity in other types of glomerulonephritis. Therefore CsA, MMF and FK506 remain a late therapeutic option for patients with these types of glomerulonephritis and severe clinical course. As the long-term CsA therapy may be complicated by acceleration of renal fibrosis, a renal biopsy is mandatory before its administration.
