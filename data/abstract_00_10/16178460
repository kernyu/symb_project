A fatal case of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae mitral valve endocarditis is described in a 45 years old male, with a history of chronic alcohol abuse and without animals contact. He presented intermittent fever, polyarthralgia, weight loss, and low back pain. In blood cultures (2 bottles), gram-positive pleomorphic rods grew after 48 hours of incubation. The subculture on blood agar media showed a small, alpha-hemolytic colony, catalase and oxidase negative, PYR and LAP positive and the production of H2S in triple sugar iron agar, was demonstrated. The isolate was initially identified as E. rhusiopathiae, and confirmed by API Coryne (BioMerieux). On the basis of these findings and a transthoracic echocardiogram, an endocarditis was confirmed. Intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin treatment was initiated. The patient became afever, nevertheless he died on day 19 after admission as a consequence of acute pulmonary edema. Susceptibility testing by E-test showed that the microorganism was resistant to vancomycin and gentamicin, and susceptible to penicillin and cefotaxime. We emphasize the importance to consider the isolates of gram-positive pleomorphic rods, catalase and oxidase negative, and the addition of H2S production test in TSI medium. Vancomycin-resistance helps in the identification, and to establish the correct antimicrobial therapy. Although E. rhusiopathiae is usually reported as an occupational pathogen, the contact with pigs and other farm animals may be underestimated.
