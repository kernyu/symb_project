In murine models the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the natural resistance associated macrophage protein (NRAMP1) play major roles in host defense against mycobacteria. iNOS regulates nitric oxide (NO) production, which is noxious for ingested mycobacteria, and NRAMP1 displays pleiotropic antimicrobial effects, including upregulation of iNOS expression. Little is known about the role of these molecules in bovine tuberculosis (TB). In this work we demonstrate by Western blot a high expression of NRAMP1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), alveolar macrophages (obtained by bronchioalveolar lavage), and lymph node granulomas from 8 Holstein-Freisian cattle with autopsy-proven bovine TB. Immunohistochemistry revealed the abundant expression of NRAMP1 and iNOS in lymph node and lung granulomas. Immunoreactivity was abundant in the cytoplasm of many epithelioid macrophages and multinucleated giant cells of the Langhans type. A striking accumulation of nitrotyrosine (NT), an indicator of iNOS activity and local NO production, was observed in granuloma cells, particularly in multinucleated Langhans cells. This study shows that the expression of NRAMP1 and iNOS is costimulated in granulomas, which are protective T-cell reactions against mycobacteria.
