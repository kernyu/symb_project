The ketolide telithromycin (HMR-3647; Ketek), a derivative of clarithromycin, has been launched by Aventis Pharma (formerly Hoechst Marion Roussel) for the treatment of respiratory tract infections with gram-positive or gram-negative cocci, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, intracellular pathogens, atypical microorganisms, toxoplasma or anaerobic bacteria. By May 2001, filings in the US and EU had been completed and a filing in Japan was expected to take place in the fourth quarter of 2001. In July 2001, telithromycin was granted marketing authorization by the EC for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections, including those caused by bacteria resistant to commonly used antibiotics. In October 2001, the product was launched in Germany. In March 2000, telithromycin was submitted to the US FDA and the EMEA, under the EU centralized approval procedure, for approval for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute sinusitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and tonsillitis/pharyngitis. The company had expected to launch the product in early 2001. The CPMP issued a positive opinion for all four indications on April 23 2001. In September 2001, the company indicated that it expected the product to be launched in Japan in 2002. The FDA's Anti-infectives Advisory Committee was due to review telithromycin for all the submitted indications on January 29 2001; however, this was postponed. This postponement was thought to be at Aventis' request in order to discuss the potential for a resistant pneumococcal infection labeling which would boost product sales. The revised date for the meeting was April 26 2001, at which the Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA recommended approval of telithromycin for the treatment of CAP in patients 18 years of age or older. The committee failed to recommend approval for the use of the drug for the remaining three indications for which it was filed, citing concerns over potential cardiovascular risk and liver toxicity; at this time, the company was in active discussions with the FDA regarding approval of the remaining three indications. An approvable letter for CAP, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute bacterial sinusitis was received by the company in June 2001; Aventis also received a non-approvable letter for the treatment of tonsillitis/pharyngitis at this time. In April 1999, ABN Amro predicted annual sales of DM 50 million in 2001, rising to DM 100 million in 2002. In February 1999, Lehman Brothers estimated a 70% probability that this ketolide would come to market. The analysts also estimated a launch date of 2001, with peak sales of US $700 million in 2009. Analysts Merrill Lynch predicted in September 200, that the product would be launched by 2001, with sales of euro 50 million in that year, rising to euro 284 million in 2004. Deutsche Bank predicted in August 2001, that sales of the product would reach euro 5 million in 2001, rising to euro 300 million in 2005. Analysts at Merrill Lynch predicted in November 2001, that the product would be resubmitted in the US in mid-2002, and would make sales of US $5 million in 2001, rising to US $250 million in 2004.
