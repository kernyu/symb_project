HIV-VIRAL HEPATITIS CO-INFECTIONS: Several characteristics reveal an HIV-HBV co-infection: high B viral replication, high percentage of patients exhibiting chronic B virus, high risk of cirrhosis, and possibility of B reactivation in severely immunodeficient patients. Regarding HIV-HCV co-infections, there is a greater risk of progression towards cirrhosis. However, anti-retroviral treatment appear to stall the progression of the C-virus hepatic disease. METABOLIC COMPLICATIONS WITH ANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENTS: Among the morphological lipodystrophic syndromes, the lipohypertrophic forms must be distinguished from the lipoatrophic forms. Substitution of some antiretroviral molecules is the first measure to be taken, but the results are difficult to assess; other current drug alternatives are unconvincing. The management of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia observed during treatment with antiretrovirals is debatable, and efficacy is not always clearly demonstrated. Regarding hyperlactatemia, potentially the most severe complication of mitochondrial toxicity of antiretroviral treatment, which requires suspension of the nucleoside analogs in severe or moderate symptomatic forms, and simple surveillance and continuation of the treatment in the mild or moderate asymptomatic forms. VIROLOGICAL FAILURE: There are three options possible: continue the same treatment, change it or stop it. Efficacy should be assessed on CD4 and the variations in viral load, rather than on the absolute value of the viral load. IN POOR RESSOURCE SETTINGS: Only a minority of patients has access to antiretroviral treatments. Efforts must be made to continue to search for other forms of management: community measures for prevention and early screening, psychological and nutritional support, prophylactic and treatment strategies for infections or opportunist diseases.
