Ion transport and the electric profile of distal airways of sheep lungs were studied in a miniature polypropylene chamber with a 1-mm aperture. Small airways with an inner diameter < 1 mm were isolated, opened longitudinally, and then mounted as a flat sheet onto the 1-mm aperture where it was glued and secured with an O-ring. Both sides of the tissue were bathed with identical physiological solutions at 37 degrees C and oxygenated. Pooled data from 27 distal airways showed an inner airway diameter of 854 +/- 22 (SE) microm and a transepithelial potential difference (PD) of 1.86 +/- 0.29 mV, lumen negative. Short-circuit current (I(sc)) was 25 +/- 3.5 microA/cm(2), tissue resistance was 96 +/- 14 Omega, and conductance was 15.2 +/- 1.7 mS/cm(2). At baseline, amiloride-sensitive Na transport accounted for 51% of I(sc) (change in I(sc) = 9.7 +/- 2.6 microA/cm(2); n = 8 airways), corresponding to 0.36 microeq. cm(-2). h(-1). Treatment with 0.1 mM bumetanide did not reduce the I(sc) (n = 5 airways). Exposure to 1 microM Ca ionophore A-23187 raised the I(sc) by 9 microA/cm(2) (47%; P < 0.03; n = 6 airways). The latter effect was blunted by bumetanide. Carbachol at 1 microM provoked a biphasic response, an initial rapid rise in I(sc) followed by a decline (n = 3 airways). There was no significant increase in PD or I(sc) in response to isoproterenol or dibutyryl cAMP. The data suggest that Na absorption constitutes at least 50% of baseline transport activity. Cl or other anion secretion such as HCO(3) appears to be present and could be stimulated by raising intracellular Ca.
