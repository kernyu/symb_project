BACKGROUND: Streptococcus agalactiae remains susceptible to penicillin; nevertheless, an increase in the resistance to other antimicrobial families, such as macrolides and more rarely fluoroquinolones, has been described. METHODS AND RESULTS: From 2003 to 2004, two fluoroquinolone-resistant S. agalactiae strains were detected. The strains presented one mutation in parC (Ser79 --> Phe) and an additional mutation in gyrA (Glu85 --> Ala or Glu85 --> Lys). CONCLUSION: This study describes the first S. agalactiae strains highly resistant to fluoroquinolones in Spain.
