Posaconazole MICs for 50 Aspergillus fumigatus isolates with distinct genotypes were determined by three methods. MICs were > or = 0.5 microg/ml for 5, 11, and 15 strains by the CLSI reference M38-A2, Etest (48-h), and oxygen consumption methods, respectively. The levels of categorical agreement between the results obtained by the CLSI method and those obtained by the oxygen consumption and Etest methods were 80 and 84%, respectively.
