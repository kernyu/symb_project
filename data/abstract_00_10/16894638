Based on the transcriptional profiling of CHO cell culture using microarray, four key early apoptosis signaling genes, Fadd, Faim, Alg-2, and Requiem, were identified and CHO GT (Gene Targeted) cell lines were developed by targeting these four genes. Two were CHO GT(O) cell lines overexpressing anti-apoptotic genes, Faim and Fadd DN and two were CHO GT(KD) cell lines involving knockdown of Alg-2 and Requiem which are pro-apoptotic genes using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology. Comparisons of these CHO GT cell lines with the parental cell line in batch culture (BC) and fed-batch culture (FBC) were performed. Compared to parental cells, the CHO GT cell lines showed apoptosis resistance as they significantly delayed and/or suppressed initiator caspase-8 and -9 and executioner caspase-3 activities during culture. FBC of CHO GT cell lines reached significantly higher maximum viable cell densities (up to 9 x 10(6) cells/mL) compared with the parental cell line (5 x 10(6) cells/mL). The recombinant interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) yields were increased by up to 2.5-fold. Furthermore, it was observed that the IFN-gamma was more highly sialylated.
