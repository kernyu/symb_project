ACHN-490 is a neoglycoside, or "next-generation" aminoglycoside (AG), that has been identified as a potentially useful agent to combat drug-resistant bacteria emerging in hospitals and health care facilities around the world. A focused medicinal chemistry campaign produced a collection of over 400 sisomicin analogs from which ACHN-490 was selected. We tested ACHN-490 against two panels of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, many of which harbored AG resistance mechanisms. Unlike legacy AGs, ACHN-490 was active against strains expressing known AG-modifying enzymes, including the three most common such enzymes found in Enterobacteriaceae. ACHN-490 inhibited the growth of AG-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MIC(90), </=4 mug/ml), with the exception of Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteae (MIC(90), 8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml, respectively). ACHN-490 was more active alone in vitro against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates with AG-modifying enzymes than against those with altered permeability/efflux. The MIC(90) of ACHN-490 against AG-resistant staphylococci was 2 mug/ml. Due to its promising in vitro and in vivo profiles, ACHN-490 has been advanced into clinical development as a new antibacterial agent.
