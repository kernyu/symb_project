Changes in fungal epidemiology and the emergence of resistance have increased the complexity of the management of patients with invasive fungal infections, as timely diagnosis and initiation of adequate antifungal therapy are key factors for improving outcomes. Therefore, alternative approaches to the empirical use of antifungal agents, which incorporate non-culture-based microbiological tools and high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, are under increasing investigation.
