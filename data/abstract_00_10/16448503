Agrobacterium tumefaciens was used to transform Ascochyta rabiei, the causal agent of chickpea blight. Employing a T-DNA containing a hygromycin resistance gene (hph), 908 transformants were obtained from germinated pycnidiospores on a selective medium containing hygromycin. Transformants were confirmed using PCR and Southern analyses and of four of these that were tested, two had integrated multicopies of the hph gene, one had two copies and one had a single insertion. Transformants were tested for the production of solanapyrone A toxin using a microtitre plate assay. Loss of toxin production by transformants was confirmed by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Sixteen transformants out of 668 tested produced significantly less solanapyrone A than the wild-type strain.
