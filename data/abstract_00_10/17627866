Plants successfully repel the vast majority of potential pathogens that arrive on their surface, with most microorganisms failing to breach the outer epidermal wall. Resistance to penetration at the epidermis is a key component of basal defence against disease and critically depends on fortification of the cell wall at the site of attempted penetration through the development of specialised cell wall appositions rich in antimicrobial compounds. Formation of cell wall appositions is achieved by rapid reorganisation of actin microfilaments, actin-dependent transport of secretory products to the infection site and local activation of callose synthesis. Plants are finely tuned to detect the presence of pathogens on their surface, perceiving both chemical and physical signals of pathogen origin. In the on-going evolution of interaction strategies, plants must continually monitor and out manoeuvre pathogen avoidance or suppression of plant defences in order to preserve the effectiveness of penetration resistance.
