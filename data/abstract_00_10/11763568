The aim of the investigation was to genotype clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates circulating at the penitentiaries of the Ivanovo Region. Mycobacterial strains were genotyped by the polymorphism of the lengths of restrictive fragments containing the insertion sequence 6110 by the routine procedure. The genotypes of Mycobacterium strains were classified in accordance with the PHRI database (New York). The strains were characterized by their sensitivity to antituberculous drugs by the absolute concentration method. The investigations indicated that in terms of the IS6110 genotype there were prevalent Mycobacteria strains belonging to 2 families: a W family (62.5% of the strains) and an AI family (25%). In addition to the monocultures, genotyping also revealed 3 mixed cultures consisting of 2 strains. Determining the drug sensitivity of the genotyped strains demonstrated both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, including multidrug resistance among the strains of the same genotyping family (W or AI).
