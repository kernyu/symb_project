OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of adefovir dipivoxil (ADV, DAIDING) for Chinese chronic hepatitis B patients with lamivudine (LAM) resistance. METHODS: This study was a multicenter, double-blind clinical trial. 209 chronic hepatitis B patients with LAM resistance were randomly put in an ADV, DAIDING or a LAM group. After 24 and 48-weeks of treatment, serum HBV DNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR and liver function tests; HBV serology and safety assessments were also conducted. RESULTS: The mean reduction of HBV DNA from baseline at 24 and 48 weeks was significantly greater in the ADV group compared with that in the LAM group (2.40 log10 vs 0.94 log10, P < 0.01; 2.71 log10 vs 1.07 log10, P < 0.01). In the ADV group, the virological response and ALT normalization at 24 and 48 weeks were significantly higher than those in the LAM group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the portion of HBeAg reduction, HBeAg seroconversion and incidence of adverse events. There was no severe adverse event related to the investigational product, DAIDING, in this trial. CONCLUSION: DAIDING (ADV) is effective and safe for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients with LAM resistance.
