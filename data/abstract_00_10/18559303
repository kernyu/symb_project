BACKGROUND: In HIV patients, disorders in glucose metabolism seem to be side effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) which may be favoured by obesity, abdominal fat accumulation and familial disposition for diabetes mellitus (DM). The aim of our study was to identify patients at high risk for abnormalities in glucose metabolism taking into account HAART, familial disposition for DM and anthropometric parameters. METHODS: Plasma glucose, insulin, c-peptide and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment, HOMA) were determined in 44 HIV patients [16 without HAART, 19 with protease inhibitors (PI), 9 without PI (non-PI)] and in 11 healthy subjects. Glucose tolerance was determined by standard procedures. Body mass index (BMI), triceps skin fold thickness and waist circumference were measured and the waist-to-hip-ratio was calculated. Familial disposition for DM was assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS: Impaired fasting glucose was observed in 28% of HAART-treated patients (21% with PI, 7% non-PI), in 13% of HAART-naive but none in healthy controls. 58% of PI, 44% of non-PI, 38% of HAART-naive and none of healthy controls had a HOMA-index > 2.5 which indicates insulin resistance. HAART-treated patients had significantly higher fasting glucose levels (PI: 97 +/- 11 mg/dL, p = 0.048; non-PI: 109 +/- 58 mg/dL, p = 0.009) compared to healthy controls (72 +/- 8 mg/dL). HOMA-Index was higher in PI treated patients (3.74 +/- 3.08) than in HIV negative controls (0.95 +/- 0.28, p = 0.018). The duration of HAART (p = 0.045), overweight and familial disposition for DM (p = 0.017) significantly affected fasting glucose among PI users. Waist circumference affected c-peptide (p = 0.046) concentration in these patients. CONCLUSION: HIV patients on long-term PI therapy with overweight and familial disposition for DM are at high risk to develop abnormalities of glucose metabolism. Thus, measurements of HOMA-Index, BMI and waist circumference should be routinely done especially in PI medicated patients.
