Four clinical U.S. glycopeptide intermediate resistant Staphylococcus aureus (GISA) isolates were resistant to Triton X-100-induced autolysis. Similar resistance was demonstrated in an isolate obtained after a single passage of a susceptible clinical isolate in low-level vancomycin. Strains with the vancomycin-induced Triton X-100 resistance phenotype produced active murein hydrolases but were resistant to lysis by murein hydrolases.
