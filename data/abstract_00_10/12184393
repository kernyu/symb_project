The jasmonate (JA) and salicylate (SA) signaling pathways in plants provide resistance to herbivorous insects and pathogens. It is known that these pathways interact, sometimes resulting in antagonism between the pathways. We tested how the timing and concentration of elicitation of each pathway influenced the interaction between the jasmonate and salicylate pathways measured in terms of five biochemical responses and biological resistance to caterpillars and bacteria. The salicylate pathway had a stronger effect on the jasmonate pathway than did the reverse. The negative signal interaction was generated by two distinct paths in the plant. A negative interaction in the biochemical expression of the two pathways was most consistent in the simultaneous elicitation experiments compared to when the elicitors were temporally separated by two days. Herbivore bioassays with Spodoptera exigua also consistently reflected an interaction between the two pathways in the simultaneous elicitation experiments. The negative signal interaction reducing biological resistance to the herbivore was also demonstrated in some temporally separated treatment combinations where attenuation of the biochemical response was not evident. Concentration of the elicitors had an effect on the pathway interaction with consistent biochemical and biological antagonism in the high concentration experiments and inconsistent antagonism in the low concentration experiments. The bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst), consistently showed reduced lesion development on plants with SA responses activated and, in some experiments, on JA-elicited plants. Resistance to Pst was not reduced or enhanced in dual-elicited plants. Thus, signal interaction is most consistent when elicitors are applied at the same time or when applied at high doses. Signal interaction affected the herbivore S. exigua, but not the pathogen Pst.
