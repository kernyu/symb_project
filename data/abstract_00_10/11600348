An in vitro cell culture model was used to investigate the long-term effects of azithromycin, rifampin, and the combination of azithromycin and rifampin on Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Although standard in vitro susceptibility testing indicated efficient inhibition by azithromycin, prolonged treatment did not reveal a clear elimination of chlamydia from host cells. Chlamydia were temporarily arrested in a persistent state, characterized by culture-negative, but viable, metabolically active chlamydia, as demonstrated by the presence of short-lived rRNA transcripts. Additionally, azithromycin induced generation of aberrant inclusions and an altered steady-state level of chlamydial antigens, with the predominance of Hsp60 protein compared to the level of the major outer membrane protein. Treatment with azithromycin finally resulted in suppression of rRNA synthesis. Chlamydial lipopolysaccharide and processed, functional rRNA were detectable throughout the entire incubation period. These in vitro data show a good correlation to those from some recent clinical investigations that have reported on the persistence of chlamydia, despite appropriate antibiotic treatment with azithromycin. Rifampin was highly active by in vitro susceptibility testing, but prolonged exposure to rifampin alone for up to 20 days resulted in the emergence of resistance. No development of resistance to rifampin was observed when chlamydia-infected cells were incubated with a combination of azithromycin and rifampin. This combination was shown to be more efficient than azithromycin alone, in that suppression of rRNA synthesis occurred earlier. Thus, such a combination may prove more useful than azithromycin alone.
