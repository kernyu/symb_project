OBJECTIVES: To provide information on the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus causing skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in France, Ireland and the UK. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One thousand three hundred and ninety patients attending their general practitioners for skin infections were recruited. Susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials using CLSI (formerly NCCLS) broth microdilution was determined for 646 S. aureus isolates detected in the evaluable patient population. RESULTS: Susceptibility results were similar in the UK and Ireland, but differed in France. The largest difference between countries was observed for erythromycin and fusidic acid. In France, 67.8% of isolates were susceptible to erythromycin when compared with 88.6% in Ireland and 92.8% in the UK. However, 93.7% of French isolates were susceptible to fusidic acid, compared with 68.6% in Ireland and 75.6% in the UK. A diagnosis of impetigo was associated with reduced fusidic acid susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the prevalence of certain diagnoses, particularly impetigo, rather than differences in antibiotic consumption may explain some of the observed differences in susceptibility seen between these countries.
