Antimicrobial resistance in Helicobacter pylori is a serious and increasing problem, and the development of rapid, reliable methods for detecting resistance would greatly improve the selection of antibiotics used to treat gastric infection with this organism. We assessed whether detection of the RdxA protein could provide the basis for determining the susceptibility of H. pylori to metronidazole. In order to raise polyclonal antisera to RdxA, we cloned the rdxA gene from H. pylori strain 26695 into the commercial expression vector pMAL-c2, purified the resultant fusion protein by affinity chromatography, and used this recombinant RdxA preparation to immunize rabbits. We then used this specific anti-RdxA antibody to perform immunoblotting on whole bacterial cell lysates of 17 metronidazole-sensitive and 27 metronidazole-resistant clinical isolates of H. pylori. While a 24-kDa immunoreactive band corresponding to the RdxA protein was observed in all metronidazole-sensitive strains, this band was absent in 25 of 27 resistant isolates. Our results indicate that testing for the absence of the RdxA protein would identify the majority of clinical isolates that will respond poorly to metronidazole-containing eradication regimens and have implications for the development of assays capable of detecting metronidazole resistance in H. pylori.
