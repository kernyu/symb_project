The efficacy of amodiaquine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria was assessed in an area of confirmed chloroquine resistance in the cool, north-central plateau of Nigeria, using a 14-day protocol. The patients were all children aged <5 years of age. The drug proved highly efficacious, giving a cure 'rate' of 100% on day 14 and mean fever- and parasite-clearance times of 1.11 and 3.11 days, respectively. It was also well tolerated. Following treatment, packed-cell volumes (PCV) generally increased (65% of patients) but remained constant (12%) or even decreased (23%) in some patients; the overall improvement in PCV was not statistically significant (P >0.05). The results justify the use of amodiaquine to treat P. falciparum malaria in those who have failed treatment with chloroquine and the second-line drugs (e.g. sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) currently used in Nigeria. As the amodiaquine would be better employed as one part of a combination than on its own, there is a need to identify suitable partner compounds.
