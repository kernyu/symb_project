The chemical structures and accumulation kinetics of several major soluble as well as wall-bound, alkali-hydrolyzable compounds induced upon infection of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves with Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato were established. All identified accumulating products were structurally related to tryptophan. Most prominent among the soluble substances were tryptophan, beta-d-glucopyranosyl indole-3-carboxylic acid, 6-hydroxyindole-3-carboxylic acid 6-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside, and the indolic phytoalexin camalexin. The single major accumulating wall component detectable under these conditions was indole-3-carboxylic acid. All of these compounds increased more rapidly, and camalexin as well as indole-3-carboxylic acid reached much higher levels, in the incompatible than in the compatible P. syringae/A. thaliana interaction. The only three prominent phenylpropanoid derivatives present in the soluble extract behaved differently. Two kaempferol glycosides remained largely unaffected, and sinapoyl malate decreased strongly upon bacterial infection with a time course inversely correlated with that of the accumulating tryptophan-related products. The accumulation patterns of both soluble and wall-bound compounds, as well as the disease resistance phenotypes, were essentially the same for infected wild-type and tt4 (no kaempferol glycosides) or fah1 (no sinapoyl malate) mutant plants. Largely different product combinations accumulated in wounded or senescing A. thaliana leaves. It seems unlikely that any one of the infection-induced compounds identified so far has a decisive role in the resistance response to P. syringae.
