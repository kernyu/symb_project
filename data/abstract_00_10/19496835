OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV infection on dyslipidaemia in a Hispanic population at high risk of insulin resistance. METHODS: We compared serum lipids and C-reactive protein (CRP) in 257 Hispanic adults including 47 HIV- mono-infected, 43 HCV-mono-infected and 59 HIV/HCV-co-infected individuals as well as 108 healthy controls. We also assessed the effect of HCV on lipid alterations associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART), and the impact of HCV and HIV on the associations among insulin resistance, triglycerides and cholesterol. RESULTS: HCV infection was associated with lower total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but not high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglycerides compared with healthy controls. HIV infection was associated with higher triglycerides and lower HDL, but not total or LDL cholesterol. HCV mitigated the elevation of triglycerides associated with ART. In healthy Hispanic adults, insulin resistance was significantly correlated with higher triglycerides, CRP and lower HDL. HIV infection nullified the association of insulin resistance with triglycerides and HDL, and the association of triglycerides with LDL. HCV infection nullified the association of insulin resistance with triglycerides, HDL and CRP. CONCLUSIONS: HCV co-infection alters the profile of HIV-associated dyslipidaemia. The clinical significance of these findings for cardiovascular complications in HIV merits further study.
