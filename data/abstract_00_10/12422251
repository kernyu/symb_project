Protease inhibitors are drugs that are commonly used in the therapy of people living with HIV infection. These drugs are commonly used in combination and act by inhibiting viral protease, blocking viral replication. Adverse drug reactions to protease inhibitors include gastrointestinal problems, rash and metabolic disturbances. The metabolic derangements associated with protease inhibitor therapy are the most problematic adverse events associated with therapy, and vary in incidence from drug to drug. These derangements include hyperlipidemia, abnormal fat distribution (lipodystrophy) and impaired glucose tolerance, which is believed to be due to peripheral insulin resistance. Clinicians caring for patients being treated with protease inhibitors must be vigilant for adverse events, notably those involving altered lipid and glucose metabolism.
