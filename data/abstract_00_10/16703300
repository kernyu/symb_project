BACKGROUND: Screening for staphylococci among various patient populations has become important for appropriate therapeutic management and for control of nosocomial infections. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the in vitro sensitivity and specificity of a chromogenic agar medium, S. aureus ID (bioMerieux, France), for the identification of Staphylococcus aureus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A well-defined collection of S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) was used. The methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates were collected in The Netherlands and all had a unique typing pattern. The methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and CNS were isolated from cultures of blood. The isolates were inoculated on Columbia agar plates with 5% sheep blood and incubated for 24 h at 35 degrees C. From the resulting cultures, a suspension of 0.5 McFarland was made and subsequently 10 mul was streaked on a S. aureus ID plate using a sterile loop. The results were read after 24 h and 48 h of incubation at 35 degrees C. Growth of colonies showing green coloration was considered to be positive (indicating S. aureus). RESULTS: A total of 519 S. aureus strains were tested (249 MSSA, 270 MRSA). The sensitivity to detect S. aureus was 96.5% (501/519) after 24 h and 97.5% (506/519) after 48 h. A total of 478 CNS were tested. The specificity was 98.5% (471/478) after 24 h and 98.3% (470/478) after 48 h. The differences between 24 h and 48 h incubation were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: S. aureus ID is highly sensitive and specific to differentiate between S. aureus and CNS in vitro. Since the performance does not significantly differ between 24 h or 48 h of incubation, samples need only 1 day of incubation before optimal results can be obtained.
