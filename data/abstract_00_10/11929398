AIM: To test the efficacy of omeprazole, furazolidone and amoxicillin triple therapy for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection after failure of standard first-line therapy recommended by the Asia-Pacific Consensus on the management of H. pylori infection. METHODS: Patients with failed H. pylori eradication received omeprazole, 20 mg, furazolidone, 100 mg, and amoxicillin, 1 g, all twice daily for 1 week. Endoscopy (CLO test, histology and culture) was performed before treatment. Post-treatment H. pylori status was determined by 13C-urea breath test 6 weeks later. RESULTS: Fifty patients were recruited. Resistance to metronidazole, clarithromycin and both drugs was in the range of 50-64%, 60-75% and 40-50%, respectively, after failure of first-line therapy. Amoxicillin resistance was not found. The intention-to-treat and per protocol H. pylori eradication rates were 52% and 53%, respectively. Patients with double resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin showed the lowest eradication rate (38%), which was significantly lower than that of patients with sensitive strains (88%). Side-effects were minimal and compliance was excellent (98%). CONCLUSIONS: One-week omeprazole, furazolidone and amoxicillin rescue therapy achieved a high eradication rate in strains sensitive to metronidazole and clarithromycin. This is a cheap and safe rescue regimen when guided by pre-treatment sensitivity testing.
