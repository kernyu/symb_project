Multidrug transporters are ubiquitous proteins, and, based on amino acid sequence similarities, they have been classified into several families. Here we characterize a cluster of archaeal and bacterial proteins from the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). One member of this family, the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) was previously shown to remove both neurotransmitters and toxic compounds from the cytoplasm, thereby conferring resistance to their effects. A BLAST search of the available microbial genomes against the VMAT sequence yielded sequences of novel putative multidrug transporters. The new sequences along with VMAT form a distinct cluster within the dendrogram of the MFS, drug-proton antiporters. A comparison with other proteins in the family suggests the existence of a potential ion pair in the membrane domain. Three of these genes, from Mycobacterium smegmatis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Halobacterium salinarum, were cloned and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. The proteins conferred resistance to fluoroquinolones and chloramphenicol (at concentrations two to four times greater than that of the control). Measurement of antibiotic accumulation in cells revealed proton motive force-dependent transport of those compounds.
