OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the bactericidal activity of pheromonicin-SA (Ph-SA) via routine in vitro/in vivo measurement. METHODS: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC50 and MIC90) of Ph-SA were evaluated via in vitro double-dilution assay with 69 strains pathogenic bacteria and via intraperitoneal infected mice with intravenous Ph-SA treatment. RESULTS: In vitro data showed that bactericidal activity of Ph-SA was approximately 12 times greater, on a molar basis, than that of vancomycin. In vivo data showed that bactericidal activity of Ph-SA was approximately 59 times greater than that of vancomycin. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that Ph-SA may be of potential value as antibiotic against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
