OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors and attributable mortality associated with imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (IRPA) infections in a medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was carried out at a 16-bed medical-surgical ICU in a 780-bed, university-affiliated hospital. All patients admitted from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2004, who had nosocomial infection caused by IRPA, were included in the study. RESULTS: Imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa was recovered from 63 patients during the study period. One hundred eighty-two controls were matched with cases by period of admission, age, and time at risk. Urinary tract (34.9%) and respiratory tract (22.2%) were the main sources of IRPA isolation. In multivariate analysis, a previous stay in the ICU (odds ratio, 3.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-9.73; P = .03) was the only independent risk factor for IRPA infection. The in-hospital mortality rate among case patients was 49% (31 of 63) compared with 33% (61 of 182) for control patients (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.07-3.44; P = .02). Thus, we had an attributable mortality of 16% (95% CI, 9.74%-22.3%; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IRPA infections are strongly related to previous ICU stay, and that IRPA infections significantly increase mortality in those critical patients.
