A total of 6,625 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates obtained from 278 hospitals throughout Japan were obtained between November and December 1997 and were examined for their sensitivities to vancomycin using Mueller Hinton (MH), brain heart infusion (BHI), agar plates, or the broth microdilution method. A concentrated inoculum of an MRSA strain or the use of highly enriched medium, such as BHI medium, allows an individual cell to grow on agar plates containing a vancomycin concentration greater than the MIC for the parent strain. However, cells of the colonies which grew on BHI agar plates containing the higher vancomycin concentrations did not acquire a level of vancomycin resistance greater than that of the parent strain and were not subpopulations of heterogeneously vancomycin-resistant MRSA. There was no significance in the fact that these colonies grew on the higher concentration of vancomycin: none showed stable resistance to vancomycin at a concentration above the MIC for the parent strain, and no cell from these colonies showed a relationship between the MIC and the ability of these colonies to grow on higher concentrations of vancomycin. The vancomycin MIC was not above 2 microg/ml for any of the cells originating from these colonies. No Mu3-type heterogeneously resistant MRSA strains, which constitutively produce subpopulations from MRSA clinical isolates with intermediate vancomycin resistance at a high frequency, were detected. There was a unipolar distribution of the MICs ranging from 0.25 to 2 microg of vancomycin/ml among the 6,625 MRSA clinical isolates, indicating that there was no Mu50-type intermediately vancomycin-resistant MRSA (MIC, 8 microg/ml by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards criteria) among the clinical isolates, and there was no evidence of dissemination of Mu3-type MRSA heteroresistant to vancomycin.
