Salmonella contamination of poultry is a global public health problem. The objective of this study was to map the distribution of Salmonella on the young chicken carcass, to improve poultry inspection and food safety. Young chickens (n = 70) in the Cornish game hen class were obtained at retail over a 3-year period. Carcasses were aseptically sectioned into 12 parts, and then Salmonella was isolated from whole-part incubations by conventional culture methods. Isolates were characterized for serotype and antibiotic resistance, and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Salmonella incidence was 21.5% (181 of 840) for parts and 57.1% (40 of 70) for carcasses. The number of contaminated parts per carcass ranged from 0 to 12, with a mean of 4.5 among contaminated carcasses. Chi-square analysis indicated that Salmonella incidence differed (P < 0.05) among parts, with rib back (38.6%) and sacral back (34.3%) being the most contaminated. Among the 40 contaminated carcasses, there were 37 different patterns of contamination among parts. Of the 33 carcasses with more than one contaminated part, 12.1% contained two serotypes, 33.3% contained two or more antibiotic resistance profiles, and 100% contained two or more PFGE patterns. The most common serotype was Typhimurium (94.5%), and most (97.2%) isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics. These results indicated a diverse pattern of Salmonella contamination among carcasses and that multiple subtypes of Salmonella were often present on contaminated carcasses. Thus, whole-carcass incubation succeeded by characterization of multiple isolates per carcass is needed to properly assess and manage this risk to public health.
