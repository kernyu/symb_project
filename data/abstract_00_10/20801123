BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated the long-term efficacy and renal safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), administered to patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus (HBV) as part of an antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, prospective cohort study of 102 patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus and HBV who were treated with TDF. RESULTS: At baseline, 80% of patients had a detectable viral load (HBV DNA >20 IU/mL). Among patients positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (n = 67), 92% had a virologic response (HBV DNA <20 IU/mL) after 5 years of treatment. There was no difference between patients with or without lamivudine resistance at baseline (P = .39). Loss rates of HBeAg and hepatitis B s antigen (HBsAg) were 46% and 12%, respectively. Among HBeAg-negative patients (n = 15), 100% had a virologic response after 4 years of treatment and 2 (13%) lost HBsAg. Twenty subjects (20%, all HBeAg-negative) had undetectable HBV DNA at baseline; during a median follow-up period of 52 months (interquartile range, 41-63 mo), 19 (95%) maintained a virologic response and 2 (10%) lost HBsAg. Overall, one patient acquired a combination of resistance mutations for anti-HBV drugs and experienced a virologic breakthrough. Three (3%) patients discontinued TDF because of increased serum creatinine levels. The estimated decrease in renal function after 5 years of TDF therapy was 9.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2), which was most pronounced shortly after TDF therapy was initiated. CONCLUSIONS: TDF, administered as part of antiretroviral therapy, is a potent anti-HBV agent with a good resistance profile throughout 5 years of therapy. Only small nonprogressive decreases in renal function were observed.
