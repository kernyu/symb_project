The activity of MK-0826, a new carbapenem, against 309 Bacteroides fragilis group strains was investigated and compared with that of 11 other beta-lactam and 5 non-beta-lactam agents. MK-0826 showed excellent activity (MICs ranged from < or =0.06 to 4 microg/ml). The new carbapenem may be useful in the treatment of mixed anaerobic infections involving B. fragilis group strains.
