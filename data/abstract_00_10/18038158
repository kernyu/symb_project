Recent clinical trials have shown a beneficial effect of mizoribine (Miz), an immunosuppressive drug, in the treatment of new-onset pediatric IgA nephropathy (IgAN). In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of Miz treatment in three children with established steroid-resistant IgAN. The patients had IgAN featuring persistent proteinuria and diffuse mesangial proliferation and had failed to respond to 2 years of treatment with prednisolone. Based upon the second biopsy results, patients were given methylprednisolone (mPSL) pulse therapy that induced a transient reduction in proteinuria, which was reversed when the mPSL dose was tapered. Miz therapy was then instigated in place of pulse mPSL. All three patients showed a substantial reduction in proteinuria and resolution of hematuria within 5 months. A follow-up biopsy in two of the patients showed a substantial reduction in the severity of glomerular lesions and a decrease in the number of activated macrophages. In conclusion, Miz therapy was found to be a safe and effective therapy in three cases of steroid-resistant pediatric IgAN. The ability of Miz to reduce the number of activated macrophages may be an important mechanism by which this drug ameliorated renal disease in these patients.
