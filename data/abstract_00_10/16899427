Since the incidence of syphilis is constantly rising in western countries during the last few years the awareness of atypical presentations of this treatable disease is warranted. Especially since early treatment results in complete elimination of Treponema pallidum, thus preventing disabilities and neurological deterioration as a consequence of late stage infection. We describe a case in which a patient with asymptomatic neurosyphilis presented with a history of longstanding episcleritis. The patient was first seen in an outpatient setting, where the resistance of ocular inflammation to steroid treatment led to the uncommon diagnosis. Prolonged antibiotic treatment resulted in a complete solution of all clinical findings and a decrease of specific treponemal antibody titers. This case might serve as an example that with the recent increase in sexual transmitted diseases practitioners might be more often confronted with uncommon presentations of syphilis.
