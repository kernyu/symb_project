One important safety criterion of using lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in food applications is to ensure that they do not carry transferable antimicrobial resistance (AR) determinants. In this study, 63 LAB belonging to six genera, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Leuconostoc, and Pediococcus, were recovered from 28 retail fermented food products in Maryland, identified to species with 16S-23S rRNA spacer PCRs, and characterized for antimicrobial susceptibility against eight antimicrobials. Besides intrinsic resistance to ciprofloxacin or vancomycin in some lactobacilli, tetracycline resistance was observed in two Streptococcus thermophilus isolates from one cheese and one sour cream sample and was associated with the presence of a nonconjugative tet(S) gene. The results indicated a low level of AR among naturally occurring and starter LAB cultures in fermented dairy and meat products in the United States; therefore, the probability for foodborne LAB to serve as reservoirs of AR is low. Further studies involving a larger sample size are needed to assess the potential risk of AR gene transfer from LAB in fermented food products.
