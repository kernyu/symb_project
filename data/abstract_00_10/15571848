A new alcohol-based hand antiseptic (Octoxy hand rub) containing a synergistic combination of an emollient (Octoxyglycerine) and preservatives was developed and evaluated for immediate and prolonged activity against transient bacteria. The in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial efficacy was compared with other alcohol hand rubs containing preservative/antimicrobial (Prevacare and Avagard). In vitro evaluation was carried out using a tube-dilution method and a pig-skin model. Rapid and prolonged efficacy in vivo was evaluated against Staphylococcus epidermidis on the hands of volunteers. Octoxy hand rub was 100% effective in rapidly killing pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in vitro. In volunteers, all three hand rubs gave a significant reduction in microbial count within 15s. Octoxy hand rub showed significantly higher efficacy against S. aureus and Escherichia coli than Avagard and Prevacare 15 min after application to the pig-skin model, and against S. epidermidis in both the pig-skin model and in volunteers. Use of Octoxy hand rub with broad-spectrum immediate and prolonged antimicrobial activity may be a very effective way of improving hand hygiene without exposing the hands to higher concentrations of antimicrobials.
