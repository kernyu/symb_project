Resistance to rifampin (rifampicin), isoniazid, and streptomycin of 69 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was analyzed by an in-house method based on mycobacteriophage D29 and a colorimetric micromethod. Both methods showed sensitivity and specificity values ranging from 93% to 100%. These simple methods offer an option for drug resistance assessment of M. tuberculosis.
