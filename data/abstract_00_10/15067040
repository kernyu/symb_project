There are conflicting reports on the requirements for the IL-27-WSX-1 pathway in the development of Th type 1 responses and resistance to intracellular pathogens; although early IFN-gamma production and resistance to Leishmania major are impaired in the absence of WSX-1 signaling, WSX-1(-/-) mice generate robust IFN-gamma responses and control infection with other intracellular protozoan pathogens. In this report, we resolve these conflicting observations and demonstrate that, in the absence of IL-4, WSX-1 is not required for early IFN-gamma production and control of L. major. Thus, the requirement for WSX-1 signaling in Th type 1 cell differentiation is restricted to conditions in which IL-4 is produced.
