A replication-defective adenoviral vector, Ad.Egr-TNF.11D, was engineered by ligating the CArG (CC(A/T)6GG) elements of the Egr-1 gene promoter upstream to a cDNA encoding human tumor necrosis factor-alpha. We report here that Ad.Egr-TNF.11D is activated by the clinically important anticancer agents cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel. N-acetylcysteine, a free radical scavenger, blocked induction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha by anticancer agents, supporting a role for reactive oxygen intermediates in activation of the CArG sequences. Importantly, resistance of PC-3 human prostate carcinoma and PROb rat colon carcinoma tumors to doxorubicin in vivo was reversed by combining doxorubicin with Ad.Egr-TNF and resulted in significant antitumor effects. Treatment with Ad.Egr-TNF.11D has been associated with inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. In this context, a significant decrease in tumor microvessel density was observed following combined treatment with doxorubicin and Ad.Egr-TNF.11D as compared with either agent alone. These data show that Ad.Egr-TNF.11D is activated by diverse anticancer drugs.
