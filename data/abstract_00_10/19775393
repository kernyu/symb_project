We report a case of cutaneous Scedosporium apiospermum infection in an immunocompromised host. S.apiospermum is an emerging opportunistic pathogen, especially in organ transplant recipients. Prompt identification is critical because of its resistance to most antifungal drugs. Its histopathologic features are indistinct and overlap with those of more commonly recognized hyalohyphomycetes such as Aspergillus species. Cultures from infected tissue are generally required for correct identification. Clinicians and pathologists must be familiar with this organism and recognize the need for culture studies in addition to histopathology in the evaluation of specimens from immunocompromised patients with suspected fungal infection.
