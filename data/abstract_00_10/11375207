Genetic analysis of the 60.2-kb lactococcal plasmid pMRC01 revealed a 19.6-kb region which includes putative genes for conjugal transfer of the plasmid and a sequence resembling an origin of transfer (oriT). This oriT-like sequence was amplified and cloned on a 312-bp segment into pCI372, allowing the resultant plasmid, pRH001, to be mobilized at a frequency of 3.4 x 10(-4) transconjugants/donor cell from an MG1363 (recA mutant) host containing pMRC01. All of the resultant chloramphenicol-resistant transconjugants contained both pRH001 and genetic determinants responsible for bacteriocin production and immunity of pMRC01. This result is expected, given that transconjugants lacking the lacticin 3147 immunity determinants (on pMRC01) would be killed by bacteriocin produced by the donor cells. Indeed, incorporation of proteinase K in the mating mixture resulted in the isolation of transformants, of which 47% were bacteriocin deficient. Using such an approach, the oriT-containing fragment was exploited to mobilize pRH001 alone to a number of lactococcal hosts. These results demonstrate that oriT of pMRC01 has the potential to be used in the development of mobilizable food-grade vectors for the genetic enhancement of lactococcal starter strains, some of which may be difficult to transform.
