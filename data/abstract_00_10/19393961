Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has emerged as an important opportunistic pathogen in the debilitated host. S maltophilia is not an inherently virulent pathogen, but its ability to colonise respiratory-tract epithelial cells and surfaces of medical devices makes it a ready coloniser of hospitalised patients. S maltophilia can cause blood-stream infections and pneumonia with considerable morbidity in immunosuppressed patients. Management of infection is hampered by high-level intrinsic resistance to many antibiotic classes and the increasing occurrence of acquired resistance to the first-line drug co-trimoxazole. Prevention of acquisition and infection depends upon the application of modern infection-control practices, with emphasis on the control of antibiotic use and environmental reservoirs.
