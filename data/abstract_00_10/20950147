In this preliminary study we show that in 2008, 3 years after antiretroviral therapy was introduced into the Karonga District, Malawi, a greater than expected number of drug-naive individuals have been infected with HIV-1 subtype C virus harboring major and minor drug resistance mutations (DRMs). From a sample size of 40 reverse transcriptase (RT) consensus sequences from drug-naive individuals we found five showing NRTI and four showing NNRTI mutations with one individual showing both. From 29 protease consensus sequences, again from drug-naive individuals, we found evidence of minor DRMs in three. Additional major and minor DRMs were found in clonal sequences from a number of individuals that were not present in the original consensus sequences. This clearly illustrates the importance of sequencing multiple HIV-1 variants from individuals to fully assess drug resistance.
