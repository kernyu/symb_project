Following the recommendations of the WHO Expert Committee for Biological Standardization (Technical reports No. 610, 1977), the French Society for Microbiology created an Antibiogram Committee (CA-SFM), with the aim of proposing the standards which define the clinical categories of antibiotic susceptibility (formerly therapeutic categories). The MIC and zone diameter interpretive standards, as well as the specific recommendations for certain species or certain antibiotic groups, are published in a yearly report.
