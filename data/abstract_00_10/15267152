Drug resistant enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC, 086 serotype) isolated from contaminated piped drinking water supply (Fecal coliform 160/100 ml) was studied for effect of disinfectants (chlorine and UVB) on stability and transmissibility of R-plasmid. The strain was resistant to streptomycin and bacitracin and tolerant to multiple metal ions of Cd, Cr, Co, As, Ni, Zn and Hg. A plasmid of molecular size of 3.7 Kb was detected in the organism. After exposure to sublethal doses of disinfectants, complete elimination of resistances to streptomycin and Cr was observed. Partial loss of resistance to Hg due to chlorine was detected. Although UVB did not effected the pattern of transmissibility effect on frequency of transfer was observed. Surprisingly, in UVB irradiated cells, significantly enhanced rate of transfer was noted.
