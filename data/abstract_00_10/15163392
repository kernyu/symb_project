AIM: To explore the effects of Syringa extract, IFN and ganyanling on the the survival rate of HepG2.2.15 cells and the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg by HepG2.2.15 cells. METHODS: (3)H-TdR incorporation and ELISA were used to detect respectively the survival rate of HepG2.2.15 cells and levels of HBsAg and HBeAg in culture supernatant of HepG2.2.15 cells after stimulation with 3 drugs. RESULTS: (1)All of the three drugs decreased the survival rate of HepG2.2.15 cells to the various extent with the increase of doses. The effect of the Syringa extract was between those of IFN and ganyanling. (2)All of the three drugs might suppress the secration of HBsAg and HbeAg by HepG2.2.15 cells in dose-dependent manner, while the the effect of the syringa extract was between those of IFN and ganyanling. CONCLUSION: The Syringa extract is an effective and low toxic anti-hepatitis B drug.
