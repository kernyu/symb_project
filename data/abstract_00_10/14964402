Acinetobacter baumannii is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics often requiring combination therapy. Annual changes of resistance to selected antimicrobials of 150 A. baumannii strains, isolated as nosocomial pathogens between 1994 and 2000 were investigated. The synergistic effects of antimicrobials were studied using a microdilution checkerboard technique in eight selected isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and to at least one aminoglycoside. Rates of resistance of cefepime, ceftazidime, ampicillin/sulbactam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin (before 1996 and between 1996-2000) were 29.7% - 72.6, 37.8% - 81.4%, 35.1% - 72.6%, 8.1% - 56.6%, 5.4% - 46.0% respectively (p < 0.001 for each one). Synergy was observed in at least one of the combinations of antibiotics from seven of eight isolates (87%), no antagonism was detected with any combination. Ceftazidime-amikacin (50%) and ampicillin/sulbactam-tobramycin (50%) were the most effective combinations. Due to the effectiveness of sulbactams to Acinetobacter, ampicillin/sulbactam-tobramycin combination is recommended as the first line of choice.
