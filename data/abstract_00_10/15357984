Syntheses and excellent anti-MRSA activities of the mansonone F analogs are reported. In addition, the minimal structural requirements for its anti-MRSA activities as well as its structure-activity relationship including the C3 substituents effects on anti-MRSA activity are also described. In particular, this study revealed that both ortho-quinone and tricyclic systems of mansonone F are essential for anti-MRSA activities.
