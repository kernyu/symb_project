Oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. Organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), Enterococcus faecium (n = 819), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 959), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group C, G, and F streptococci (n = 84), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). Among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. The vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. Penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among S. pneumoniae isolates. Among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. Oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. The maximum oritavancin MIC against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the MIC(90) against S. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. Against E. faecalis and E. faecium, oritavancin MIC(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. Oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including VanA strains (n = 486), with MIC(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against VanA E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. Oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); MIC(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. These data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. The data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.
