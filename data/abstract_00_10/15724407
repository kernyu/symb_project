OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of tetrandrine on reversion of mice S180's obtained multi-drug resistance tumor cell induced by chemotherapy by PFC. And then discuss the molecular mechanism of it for the use of TCM in clinic to restrain the drug-resistant of chemotherapy, thereby improve the curative effect. METHOD: By the methods of less dosage of chemotherapy PFC, give the mouse cisplatin 3 mg x kg(-1) i.p., once a week; CTX and 5-FU 3 mg x kg(-1) i.g. four weeks, set up the mice models of multi-drug resistance of S180 tumor cell, and then observe the P170, Fas, CD54 and apoposis by flow cytometry. RESULT: Tetrandrine can obviously lower the express of P170 increase the express of Fas and the apoposis of drug resistant tumor cell. And at the same time it can obviously reduce the express of intercellular adhesion molecule (CD54). CONCLUSION: Terandrine, with its adjustment of correlated biotic active matter, can intervene the occurrence of the multi-drug resistance of tumor cells induced by chemotherapy.
