The tripartite efflux systems MexAB-OprM and MexCD-OprJ of Pseudomonas aeruginosa each display characteristic substrate specificity against a variety of antimicrobial agents. The chimeric efflux system MexC-MexB-OprJ/DeltaMexD constructed by exchange of MexD with MexB endowed the recombinant host the same resistance profile as MexAB-OprM rather than MexCD-OprJ. The change of substrate specificity was shown to be due to extrusion from the chimeric efflux system by cellular accumulation experiments using tetracycline, erythromycin, and ethidium bromide. Thus, we conclude that MexB and MexD are primary components of the efflux system responsible for sorting extrusion substrates.
