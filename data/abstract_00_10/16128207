Acute HIV-infection mostly presents with unspecifc symptoms. Thus the acute retroviral syndrome is often not readily recognized. Here we present an interim analysis of a prospective study from 62 patients with documented acute HIV infection acquired between January 2002-August 2004 in the greater Zurich area. 61.5% of patients were infected by homosexual contacts, mostly with HIV-1 subtype B, 34% acquired infection by heterosexual contacts, often with non-B-virus subtypes. Transmission occurred in all sexually active age groups (18-72 years). Clinical symptoms presented as follows: fever (77%), pharyngitis (56%), fatigue (52%), gastrointestinal symptoms (45%), rash (39%). On first physician contact, an ARS was only suspected in 27% of the cases. Patients primarily called on their family doctors (37.5%), went to see larger walk in clinics or emergency rooms (37.5%), and 16% were hospitalised. In 16% of patients other sexually transmitted diseases were diagnosed contemporaneously. Drug resistant virus (single class resistance) was transmitted in only one patient.
