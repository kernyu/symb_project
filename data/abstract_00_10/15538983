Pyelonephritis is a common clinical entity, although accurate data regarding the true prevalence of this infection are lacking. Acute pyelonephritis is associated with significant morbidity and even mortality. There are very few randomized controlled clinical trials that have addressed the optimal management strategies and antimicrobial therapy for this infection. Increasing resistance among uropathogens, especially Escherichia coli, has impacted recommendations for empiric antimicrobial therapy, and fluoroquinolones have emerged as the empiric therapy of choice for individuals managed as outpatients; more options are available for empiric parenteral therapy for those who require hospitalization. Further study of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens and of alternative agents for the management of pyelonephritis is urgently needed.
