Complicated skin and skin structure infections encompass a diverse range of diseases frequently caused by Gram-positive pathogens, and most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Treatment of these infections represents a growing clinical challenge as increases in multi-drug-resistant organisms and cross-resistance to antimicrobial therapy have made empiric therapeutic choices more difficult, particularly for patients with known risk factors or who are immunocompromised. Complicating this issue has been the relative lack of new agents with antimicrobial potency against prevalent resistant species such as meticillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Tigecycline, a novel glycylcycline, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with potent microbiological activity against the wide variety of organisms implicated in the aetiology of complicated skin and skin structure infections. Recent phase III clinical data confirm previous observations on the safety and efficacy of tigecycline for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections. Tigecycline was shown to be non-inferior to combination vancomycin-aztreonam regimens and exhibited high clinical success rates. MIC(90) values for tigecycline were uniformly low for both susceptible and resistant pathogens. Adverse events were similar in incidence for both patient populations, with nausea and vomiting reported more frequently with tigecycline treated patients while rash and elevated liver transaminases were most commonly observed in the vancomycin-aztreonam treatment group. Tigecycline helps to address the urgent need for new antimicrobial agents to combat the emergence of multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Current clinical, microbiological and safety data support the use of tigecycline as a valuable therapeutic option in the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
