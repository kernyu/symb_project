Microbiological method of direct accelerated assessment of resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to rifampicin and isoniazide was developed which is able to detect multidrug resistant M. tuberculosis 10-21 days after obtaining of sputum--4-5 times faster compared with the method of absolute concentrations. Efficacy of the method was 0.93 and 0.96 during assessment of susceptibility to rifampicin and isoniazide respectively.
