We found a relatively high frequency of unique amantadine-resistant H3N2 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses (Val27Ile on M2 protein) isolated from live poultry markets in South Korea and confirmed that a Val27Ile single substitution in the M2 protein is enough to acquire the amantadine resistance phenotype by using reverse-genetically created human-avian reassortant viruses.
