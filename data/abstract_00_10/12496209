Staphylococcus aureus achieves resistance to defensins and similar cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) by modifying anionic membrane lipids via MprF with L-lysine, which leads to repulsion of these host defense molecules. S. aureus DeltamprF, which lacks the modification, was very efficiently killed by neutrophil defensins and CAMP-producing leukocytes, even when oxygen-dependent killing was disrupted, but was as susceptible as wild-type bacteria to inactivation by myeloperoxidase or human monocytes lacking defensins. These results demonstrate the impact and specificity of MprF-mediated CAMP resistance and underscore the role of defensin-like peptides in innate host defense.
