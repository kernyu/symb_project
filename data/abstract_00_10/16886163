Previously, we found that 4 weeks of treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir did not decrease insulin sensitivity but did increase adiponectin levels. In the present study, a single dose of lopinavir-ritonavir decreases insulin sensitivity but does not alter adiponectin levels. Insulin resistance from protease inhibitors may decrease with prolonged use; an increase in adiponectin levels may mediate this effect.
