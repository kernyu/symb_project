The activity of selected antimicrobial agents against Staphylococcus aureus was determined with the agar disk diffusion test to determine the diameter of the zone of inhibition and the E-test for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). The 92 S. aureus strains used in this study were isolated from bovine (n = 76) and ovine (n = 16) intramammary infections. Four antibiotics, which are frequently used in mastitis therapy were chosen: penicillin-G, ampicillin, kanamycin, and cephalexine. The fifth compound (oxacillin) was used to detect methicillin-resistant S. aureus, but no such strains could be found. According to the evaluation criteria, 65.2 (penicillin) to 93.5% (kanamycin, cephalexine) S. aureus strains were susceptible to the antibiotics tested. Ovine S. aureus strains reveal a lower resistance rate than bovine isolates. Comparison of the results of the two methods of susceptibility testing shows, with exception of penicillin and ampicillin, satisfactory agreement. Analyzing the results of the MIC endpoints and the zone diameter values, very major errors, according to the error rate bounded method of Metzler and DeHaan, occurred at an error rate of 3.3% for penicillin and 3.8% for ampicillin.
