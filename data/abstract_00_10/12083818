Interferon (IFN) in combination with ribavirin is the main treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The sensitivity or resistance of the virus to IFN has been linked to certain types of the interferon sensitivity determining region (ISDR) and PKR-eIF2alpha phosphorylation homology domain (PePHD) sequences in the NS5A and E2 regions of the viral genome, respectively. In search of the other potential mechanisms of HCV resistance to IFN, we tested the effect of IFN-alpha on translational activity of the HCV IRES in various cell types. Using bicistronic dual luciferase reporter RNAs in direct RNA transfection studies, we found that the cap-dependent translation was dramatically inhibited by IFN (5- to 16-fold), whereas HCV IRES translation was inhibited only marginally in two hepatoma cell lines, Huh7 and HepG2 cells. No difference in IFN sensitivity was observed among IRESs of genotypes 1a, 1b, and 2a. Translation under the control of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRES was inhibited by IFN to the same extent as cap-dependent translation. In cells of nonhepatic origin (HeLa and Raji), however, HCV IRES-, EMCV IRES-, and cap-dependent translation were dramatically inhibited to similar levels. The PKR expression level was enhanced by IFN in all cells, but eIF2alpha phosphorylation level was not changed, probably due to the absence of double-stranded RNA species. There was also no evidence of RNase L activation. Therefore, inhibition of translation by IFN under these conditions was probably mediated by novel IFN-induced inhibitory pathways, independent of eIF2alpha phosphorylation, while HCV IRES was not subject to this inhibition in hepatoma cell lines. Thus, HCV IRES-driven translation was resistant to IFN-induced, eIF2alpha-independent inhibition in human hepatoma cells that are frequently used in studies on HCV replication. This may present a new potential mechanism of viral resistance to IFN treatment during the early steps of virus infection.
