Dramatic advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of influenza in Japan in recent years. Most patients with influenza-like illness are now tested with rapid diagnostic tests, and if the results are positive, they are treated with neuraminidase inhibitors, mostly oseltamivir.

Stockpiling of those antivirals is essential for pandemic preparedness plan.
