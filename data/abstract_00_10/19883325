Hepatitis B virus is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide and is associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, progressive hepatic fibrosis and end-stage liver disease. Suppression of HBV replication is recognized as the primary on-treatment goal of antiviral therapy, as reduction of serum HBV DNA to low or undetectable levels is highly likely to have a positive impact on long-term clinical outcomes in HBV-associated chronic liver disease. Entecavir is an oral nucleoside analogue that effectively inhibits HBV polymerase, resulting in rapid viral suppression. Long-term data on patients receiving entecavir for chronic hepatitis B have demonstrated high potency, a low incidence of antiviral drug resistance and good tolerability, making entecavir an ideal first-line agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.
