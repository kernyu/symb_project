Seventy-six (75.2%) of 101 Escherichia coli isolates, collected over a 2-month period in 2002 at the Children's Hospital of Tunis (Tunisia), were resistant to at least one beta-lactam. They produced beta-lactamases which were further characterized by spectrophotometry, isoelectric focusing (IEF) and PCR. Seventy-five isolates had a pI 5.4 beta-lactamase and one isolate expressed a pI 5.6 beta-lactamase. These beta-lactamases were active against penicillins and cephalothin. Nineteen of 76 isolates were resistant to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination. The bla(TEM) gene was detected in 71 isolates, all expressed a pI 5.4 beta-lactamase that was assumed to be TEM-1 or inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT). Thirty-eight of 76 isolates showed one weak band on IEF with pIs ranging from 8.2 to >9, suggesting low level expression of the chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase. Five of 76 isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), with a basic pI of 7.9 or 8.7, active on penicillins, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, but not on cefoxitin. bla(SHV) genes were detected in three isolates producing pI 7.9 ESBLs but not in two isolates expressing pI 8.7 ESBLs. These latter showed strong cefotaxime-hydrolyzing activities. Hence, they might be CTX-M-type ESBLs.
