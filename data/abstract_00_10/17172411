Thymidylate synthase (TS) overexpression is a key determinant of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance in human cancer cells. TS is also acutely up-regulated with 5-FU treatment, and, thus, novel strategies targeting TS down-regulation seem to be promising in terms of modulating 5-FU resistance. Here, we report that histone deacetylase inhibitors can reverse 5-FU resistance by down-regulating TS. By using cDNA microarrays and validation experiments, we found that trichostatin A reduced the expression of both TS mRNA and TS protein. Cotreatment with trichostatin A and cycloheximide restored TS mRNA expression, suggesting that TS mRNA is repressed through new protein synthesis. On the other hand, TS protein expression was significantly reduced by lower doses of trichostatin A (50 nmol/L). Mechanistically, TS protein was found to interact with heat shock protein (Hsp) complex, and trichostatin A treatment induced chaperonic Hsp90 acetylation and subsequently enhanced Hsp70 binding to TS, which led to the proteasomal degradation of TS protein. Of note, combined treatment with low-dose trichostatin A and 5-FU enhanced 5-FU-mediated cytotoxicity in 5-FU-resistant cancer cells in accordance with TS protein down-regulation. We conclude that a combinatorial approach using histone deacetylase inhibitors may be useful at overcoming 5-FU resistance.
