BACKGROUND: Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to Streptococcus pneumoniae is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality. We communicate two cases of CAP with complications. In both cases levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae was isolated in pleural effusion. Patient 1: A 51-year-old man who had not received previous treatment with quinolones was admitted to the hospital for CAP and initially treated with levofloxacin (500 mg/24h iv). Four days later pleural effusion developed and fluid culture isolated levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC > 32 .g/ml). The outcome was favorable following chest tube placement and treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics. Patient 2: A 73-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was admitted due to CAP and was initially treated with levofloxacin (500 mg/24 h iv). He was transferred to our hospital after 10 days of treatment with this antibiotic, following the development of pleural effusion with isolation of levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC = 12 .g/ml). The patient was treated with chest tube placement and beta-lactam antibiotics with a favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CAP treated empirically must be closely followed, both clinically and radiologically, to facilitate early detection of complications due to bacterial resistance to the prescribed antibiotic. Patients with CAP who have received quinolones in the weeks before the development of pneumonia should not been treated empirically with these antibiotics because of the risk of resistance development.
