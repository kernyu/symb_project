OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics of nosocomial infection of extended spectrum beta-lactamase(ESBL)- producing bacteria. METHODS: The data of 50 cases of ESBL(+) E. coli and K. pneumonia from January to November 1999 in Peking Union Medical Hospital were analysed; 45 cases of ESBL (-) infection were randomly selected as controls. t-test and chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Long time hospitalization and use of the third generation cephalosporins were risk factors for ESBL(+) pathogen infection(P < 0.02); the prevalence of ESBL(+) bacteria infection in abdominal and pelvic cavity was higher than that of ESBL(-) bacteria(P < 0.02); the outcome of properly treated group(sensitive antibiotics were used within 72 hours) was much better than improperly treated group. All ESBL(+) bacteria were sensitive to imipenam, the resistance rate of ESBL(+) bacteria to cefmetazole, amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam was low; the in vitro activity of ceftazidim to ESBL(+) bacteria was high but the in vivo activity is still under study. CONCLUSION: The mortality of ESBL(+) bacteria infection was high; the outcome would be improved if sensitive antibiotics were chosen as soon as the diagnosis was made.
