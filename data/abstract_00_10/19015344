Indian Leishmania donovani isolates (n = 19) from regional zones representing various levels of antimony resistance displayed significantly (P < 0.01) correlated results with respect to in vitro susceptibility to the antileishmanial drugs sodium antimony gluconate, amphotericin B, and Miltefosine, raising the possibility of cross-resistance mechanisms operating in the field isolates. The results of gene expression analysis of LdMT and LdRos3 were suggestive of alternate mechanisms of Miltefosine susceptibility in the isolates.
