OBJECTIVE: Timely initiation of antibiotic therapy is crucial for severe infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is often delayed for nosocomial infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The relationship between knowledge of colonization caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria (ABR-GNB) and rate of appropriate initial antibiotic therapy for subsequent bacteremia was evaluated. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Fifty-four-bed intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. In this unit, colonization surveillance is performed through routine site-specific surveillance cultures (urine, mouth, trachea, and anus). Additional cultures are performed when presumed clinically relevant. PATIENTS: ICU patients with nosocomial bacteremia caused by ABR-GNB. RESULTS: Infectious and microbiological characteristics and rates of appropriate antibiotic therapy were compared between patients with and without colonization prior to bacteremia. Prior colonization was defined as the presence (detected > or = 2 days before the onset of bacteremia) of the same ABR-GNB in colonization and subsequent blood cultures. During the study period, 157 episodes of bacteremia caused by ABR-GNB were suitable for evaluation. One hundred seventeen episodes of bacteremia (74.5%) were preceded by colonization. Appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy (started within 24 hours) was administered for 74.4% of these episodes versus 55.0% of the episodes that occurred without prior colonization. Appropriate therapy was administered within 48 hours for all episodes preceded by colonization versus 90.0% of episodes without prior colonization. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of colonization status prior to infection is associated with higher rates of appropriate therapy for patients with bacteremia caused by ABR-GNB.
