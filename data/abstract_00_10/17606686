A novel oxazolidinone, AM 7359, was evaluated in two mouse models of Staphylococcus aureus infection. AM 7359 and linezolid were equally efficacious in a methicillin-susceptible S. aureus organ burden model and a methicillin-resistant S. aureus localized infection model. However, AM 7359 was eightfold more efficacious than linezolid against a linezolid- and methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain in this localized (thigh) infection model.
