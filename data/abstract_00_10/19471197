Methyl gallate is a major component of Galla Rhois, as carvacrol is of oregano essential oils. Both have shown good antibacterial activity against intestinal bacteria. This study investigated the antibacterial activities of nalidixic acid in combination with methyl gallate and carvacrol against nalidixic acid resistant bacteria. The combined effect of nalidixic acid with methyl gallate and carvacrol was evaluated using the checkerboard method to obtain a fractional inhibitory concentration index. The results showed that the combinations of nalidixic acid + methyl gallate/carvacrol improved nalidixic acid resistant pathogenic bacteria inhibition with synergy or partial synergy activity. Thus, a strong bactericidal effect of the drug combinations was observed. In vitro data thus suggested that nalidixic acid combined with methyl gallate and carvacrol may be microbiologically beneficial, rather than antagonists.
