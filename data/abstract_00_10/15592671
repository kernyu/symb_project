Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) with the t(11;17) translocation usually respond poorly to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy. We describe a patient with promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger/retinoic acid receptor alpha (PLZF/RARalpha) APML who was treated with combination chemotherapy after poor response to arsenic trioxide. He achieved hematological remission in 4 weeks followed by achievement of molecular remission in 8 weeks. Four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy followed by four cycles of maintenance therapy were given over a period of 9 months. At a follow-up of 32 months after achieving hematological remission, he continues to remain in hematological and molecular remission with normal blood parameters and negative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results. Combination chemotherapy can achieve sustained remission in patients with PLZF/RARalpha APML.
