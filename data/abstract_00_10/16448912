Gonorrhea is a worldwide sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Gonorrhea is the second most often reported STD in the United States behind chlamydia. An estimated 600,000 people each year in the United States are infected. Only about half this number of cases are reported. From 1975 through 1997, the national gonorrhea rate declined 74.3%. After a small increase in 1998, the gonorrhea rate has decreased each year since 1999. In 2003 the South had the highest gonorrhea rate among the four regions of the country. Antimicrobial resistance remains an important consideration in the treatment of gonorrhea. In 2003 the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project found about 16% of collected isolates were resistant to penicillin and/or tetracycline. Since 1998 the number of ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates has been increasing with 270 (4.1%) being reported in 2003. Oral gonorrhea is rare, nonspecific, and varied and may range from slight erythema to severe ulceration with a pseudomembranous coating. The patient with gonorrhea poses little threat of disease transmission to the dentist. However, patients who have or have had gonorrhea should be approached with a measure of caution because they are in a high-risk group for additional STDs. The CDC has published recommendations for standard precautions to be followed in controlling infection in dentistry that have become the standard for preventing cross-infection. Strict adherence to these recommendations will, for all practical purposes, eliminate the danger of disease transmission between dentist and patient. Dentists should be aware of local statutory requirements regarding reporting STDs to state health officials. Syphilis, gonorrhea, and AIDS are reportable diseases in every state. Local health departments or state STD programs are sources of information regarding this matter.
