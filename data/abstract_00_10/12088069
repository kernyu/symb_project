During October 1998 a study was performed in the Caledon area to determine the presence of anthelmintic resistance in the southern Western Cape, which falls within the winter rainfall region of South Africa. The study took the form of an undifferentiated faecal egg count reduction test (FECRt) survey. The predominant worm genera of the region are Teladorsagia and Trichostrongylus, but Haemonchus causes occasional outbreaks in sheep. No resistance data for any area in the Western Cape Province are available at present. Resistance (< 90% FECR) was recorded on 73% of the farms included in the study, with 46% of these involving resistance to 1 drench, 36% to 2 drenches and 18% to 3 drenches. No moxidectin resistance was detected when it was administered at the therapeutic dosage of 0.2 mg/kg. The results of this study show clearly that resistance of nematodes to other anthelmintics occurs in the Caledon area.
