OBJECTIVE: To investigate risk factors of 26 cases with lower respiratory tract infection caused by Flavobacteria and its antimicrobial susceptibility in vitro. METHODS: Retrospective study of the clinical materials of 26 cases of lower respiratory tract infection caused by Flavobacteria. Antimicrobial susceptibility (MIC) was determined with the method of agar dilution. RESULTS: All of 26 cases suffered from underlying diseases, among them malignant tumors were most common (31%) illness. 50% of the cases were mixed infections. Risk factors of infections were application of multiple antibiotics (81%), host immune suppression (77%), invasive manasements (31%), and prolonged hospitalization. No specific clinical manifestations and chest X-ray appearance revealed. Isolates were highly resistant to most of antimicrobial agents. Ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and piperacillin are the most sensitive agents. CONCLUSIONS: Lower respiratory tract infection caused by Flavobacteria developed most commonly in patients who suffered from various underlying diseases, immunodeficiency, and longtime antibiotic overuse. Clinical isolates were highly resistant to most kinds of antimicrobial agents.
