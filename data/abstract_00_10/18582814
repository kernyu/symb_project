We present 6 cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia in lung transplant recipients. All cases were treated with imipenem and/or non-traditional antibiotics, such as tigecycline and colistimethate, and had different microbiologic and clinical outcomes. Prior treatment with broad-spectrum anti-microbial therapy was the single most likely risk factor for the development of infection due to MDR Acinetobacter baumannii. Ideal preventive and therapeutic strategies for this pathogen in lung transplant recipients require further study.
