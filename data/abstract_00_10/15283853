Th2 cytokines, commonly detected in burn patients, have been shown as inhibitors for the generation of Th1 cells that are essential for the host's resistance against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. In this study, the possibility of immunological treatment through the regulation of Th1/Th2 responses was examined in two kinds of human severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) chimera models reflecting human immune functions. SCID mice injected with a mixture of PBMC from a healthy donor and Th2 cells experimentally generated from the same healthy PBMC (Th2 SCID chimeras) were more susceptible to HSV-1 infection when compared with SCID mice injected with healthy donor PBMC (healthy SCID chimeras). When Th2 SCID chimeras were individually treated with human IL-12 (hIL-12) or human soluble IL-4 receptor (hsIL-4R), hIFN-gamma was not produced in their sera after antihuman CD3 mAb stimulation. However, hIFN-gamma production in sera of Th2 SCID chimeras treated with the combination therapy of hIL-12 and hsIL-4R was recovered at levels observed in healthy SCID chimeras. When Th2 SCID chimeras infected with HSV-1 were treated with saline, hIL-12, hsIL-4R or a combination of hIL-12 and hsIL-4R, 13%, 13%, 25% or 100% of them survived, respectively. Also, Th1 responses (hIFN-gamma production) were demonstrated in Th2 SCID chimeras that became resistant against HSV-1 infection after the combination treatment. These results suggest that individuals whose Th2 cells predominated may be immunologically controlled by the combination treatment between a Th1 response inducer and a Th2 response inhibitor.
