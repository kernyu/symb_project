Penetration of linezolid into bone and joint tissues was studied by high-performance liquid chromatography in 13 patients suffering from implant-associated infections with methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Mean concentrations of linezolid in infected tissues were greater than 10 mg/liter in a sampling time range of 35 to 124 min after administration of the preoperative dose, except in bone specimens, where they reached 3.9 +/- 2.0 mg/liter.
