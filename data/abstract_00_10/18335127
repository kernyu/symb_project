AIM: This case report aims at describing an infection of the tongue as a manifestation of a Trichosporon asahii infection, its association with bronchial asthma and steroid administration, and to present a review of the literature pertaining to its antifungal susceptibility profile. BACKGROUND: Trichosporon asahii has been reported to be associated with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from superficial infection to severe disseminated diseases, particularly in immunocompromised patients. CASE REPORT: A 36-year-old male asthmatic patient with recurrent glossitis presented with a chief complaint of burning sensation and two red areas on the dorsum of the tongue of three months duration. The glossitis was associated with Trichosporon asahii, which had a reduced susceptibility to some azole antifungal agents. SUMMARY: Trichosporon asahii is an emerging fungal pathogen which may cause a wide range of clinical manifestations. More reports on its various clinical presentations in the oral environment need to be made available in the literature. To date there is a paucity of data on its prevalence, pathogenesis, and antifungal resistance mechanism.
