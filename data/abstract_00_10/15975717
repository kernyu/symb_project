A study was performed to determine the frequency of the mutant MDR1 allele associated with ivermectin sensitivity in a sample of Collies and other herding breeds living in Australia. Buccal swab samples were collected from 33 Collies, 17 Australian Shepherds, 7 Border Collies and 7 Shelties for determination of MDR1 genotype. DNA was extracted and the polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify a 148 base pair (wildtype MDR1 genotype or 144 base pair (mutant MDR1 genotype) amplicon containing the MDR1 mutation. Sequence analysis was performed to determine the genotype of each dog. Adequate quantities of DNA for unequivocal genotyping were obtained from 61 of 64 samples. The previously described MDR1 mutation was identified in Collies, Australian Shepherds and Shelties living in Australia, but not in Border Collies (although sample numbers were low). Twelve percent (4/33) of the Collies studied were homozygous for the normal allele (normal), 64% (21/33) were heterozygous (carrier) and 24% (8/33) were homozygous for the mutant allele (affected). Results of this study indicate that a high percentage of herding breeds presenting to veterinarians in Australia harbor the MDR1 mutation, thus impacting some therapeutic decisions.
