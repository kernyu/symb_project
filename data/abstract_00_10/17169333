Multidrug resistance related protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1) is an ABC transporter protein related to the extrusion of reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and GSH-conjugates, as well as leukotriene C(4) and cyclopentane prostaglandins. Inhibition of ABCC1 activity impairs lymphocyte activation. The present work studied ABCC1 expression and activity on a murine macrophage cell line, RAW 267.4 and the effects of ABCC1 classical inhibitors, as well as GSH metabolism modulators, on LPS induced activation. Approximately, 75% of resting cells were positive for ABCC1 and the classical ABCC1 reversors (indomethacin, 0.1-2mM; probenecid, 0.1-10mM and MK571, 0.01-1mM) were able to enhance intracellular CFDA accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting ABCC1 inhibition. After LPS (100ng/ml) activation 50% of the population was positive for ABCC1, and this protein was still active. In LPS-activated cells, ABCC1 activity was also impaired by BSO (1mM), an inhibitor of GSH synthesis. Conversely, GSH (5mM) reversed the BSO effect. ABCC1 inhibition by indomethacin, probenecid or MK571 decreased LPS induced nitrite production in a concentration-dependent manner, the same result was observed with BSO and again GSH reversed its effect. The ABCC1 reversors were also able to inhibit iNOS expression. In conclusion, LPS modulated the expression and activity of ABCC1 transporters in RAW macrophages and inhibitors of these transporters were capable of inhibiting nitrite production suggesting a role for ABCC1 transporters in the inflammatory process.
