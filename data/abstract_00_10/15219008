This study was undertaken to assess whether oropharyngeal vancomycin may control oropharyngeal carriage and lower airway infection due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) acquired in the intensive care unit (ICU). Secondary endpoints were the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus and vancomycin consumption. A total of 84 patients, admitted to a medical/surgical ICU and mechanically ventilated for >72 h, were randomly assigned to control (n=42) or test (n=42) group. Both groups received the protocol of selective decontamination of the digestive tract, including polymyxin E, tobramycin and amphotericin B. Patients in the test group received 0.5 g of a 4% vancomycin gel at 6-h intervals in the oropharynx. Lower airway infections due to MRSA acquired on the ICU were reduced in the test group, as was oropharyngeal carriage. Neither vancomycin-resistant enterococci nor vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus were isolated from either surveillance or diagnostic samples during the study period. The vancomycin costs were lower in the test group. This study demonstrates that oropharyngeal vancomycin, which controls intensive care unit-acquired lower airway infections and secondary carriage due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is cost-effective and safe in terms of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus.
