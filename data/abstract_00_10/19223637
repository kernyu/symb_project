Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 containing the reverse transcriptase mutation M184V or K65R or mutations M41L, M184V, and T215Y did not accumulate additional resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase when increasing amounts of apricitabine drug pressure were applied. The original mutations were maintained by the presence of apricitabine but were lost when cultured without drug pressure.
