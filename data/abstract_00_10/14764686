In the early phase of an immune response, T cells are activated and acquire effector functions. Whereas these short term activated T cells are resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis, activated T cells in prolonged culture are readily sensitive, leading to activation-induced cell death and termination of the immune response. The translation inhibitor, cycloheximide, partially overcomes the apoptosis resistance of short term activated primary human T cells. Using this model we show in this study that sensitization of T cells to apoptosis occurs upstream of mitochondria. Neither death-inducing signaling complex formation nor expression of Bcl-2 proteins is altered in sensitized T cells. Although the caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP(long) was only slightly down-regulated in sensitized T cells, c-FLIP(short) became almost undetectable. This correlated with caspase-8 activation and apoptosis. These data suggest that c-FLIP(short), rather than c-FLIP(long), confers resistance of T cells to CD95-mediated apoptosis in the context of immune responses.
