Elevated plasma free fatty acids (FFA) cause insulin resistance and are thought to play a key role in mediating insulin resistance in patients with the metabolic syndrome (MTS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Two experimental models used to study the mechanisms responsible for insulin resistance in patients are high-fat diet-fed rodents and administration of triglycerides and heparin to raise plasma FFA. As evidence that insulin resistance in high-fat diet-fed rats is due to high FFA, it has been reported that the insulin resistance is rapidly reversed by an overnight fast, a high-glucose meal, and an exercise bout. If true, these findings would invalidate the high-fat diet-fed rodent as a model for MTS or type 2 DM, because insulin resistance is not rapidly reversed by these treatments in patients. The purpose of this study was to determine whether diet-induced insulin resistance is, in fact, rapidly reversible. Incubation of muscles in vitro rapidly reversed insulin resistance induced by administration of triglycerides and heparin, but not by a high-fat diet. An overnight fast and a high-glucose meal were followed by a large increase in insulin-stimulated muscle glucose transport. However, these are adaptive responses, rather than reversals of insulin resistance, because they also occurred in muscles of insulin-sensitive, chow-fed control rats. Our results show that insulin resistance induced by high FFA, i.e., Randle glucose-fatty acid cycle, is transient. In contrast, the insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet does not reverse rapidly.
