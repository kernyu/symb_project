Increased resistance to fluconazole has been reported in oral, oesophageal and urinary Candida isolates, but this has not been observed commonly in genital tract isolates. The rate of isolation of Candida spp. and their susceptibility to amphotericin B, flucytosine and azoles were determined in a number of clinical practices in the city of Ghent, Belgium. Patients with symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) were treated with fluconazole, and the mycological and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Isolates were identified as Candida albicans (78.6%), Candida guilliermondii (17.3%), Candida glabrata (2.6%) and Candida dubliniensis (1.3%). The rates of mycological and clinical cures were 79.5% and 100%, respectively. Women with recurrent VVC were infected more frequently by non-albicans Candida spp., but no association was found between the use of antifungal agents and the presence of non-albicans spp. In-vitro resistance to fluconazole was not detected, even among subsequent Candida isolates from nine patients for whom mycological cure was not achieved.
