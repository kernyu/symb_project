Resistance to vancomycin has emerged among Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), and enterococci, and this emergence has particular prevalence in dialysis units. It has therefore become imperative that physicians use vancomycin judiciously. General recommendations regarding the appropriate use of vancomycin have been developed. Although in theory implementation of these guidelines should not be difficult, the medical community may be unable or unwilling to make the necessary adjustments in practice. The onslaught of cost constraints and bureaucratic encumbrance has occurred simultaneously with the increase in vancomycin resistance among pathogens commonly isolated among the dialysis population. When a patient responds to empiric antibiotic therapy and susceptibility data indicate that an antibiotic other than vancomycin would be appropriate, the clinician far too often does not make the change to this alternative. Previously there was no biological imperative to change the antibiotic. That complacency has infected an entire generation of physicians, and especially nephrologists. Furthermore, there is an active movement against change, driven by concerns such as malpractice accusations and frank errors in the interpretation of medical facts.
