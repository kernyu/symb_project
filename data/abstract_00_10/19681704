Severe coccidioidomycosis is rare, and specific genetic susceptibility to the disease remains unidentified. We describe a patient with disseminated recalcitrant coccidioidomycosis with autosomal dominant interferon-gamma receptor 1 deficiency caused by a heterozygous IFNGR1 818del4 mutation. Therefore, the interleukin-12/interferon-gamma axis appears to be critical for control of coccidioidomycosis.
