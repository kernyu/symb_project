This study included 200 randomly selected multibacillary leprosy cases who had completed 1 year of fixed World Health Organization recommended multidrug therapy (WHO-MDT) without prior dapsone (DDS) monotherapy. The time interval after release from treatment varied from a few months to 8 years. All cases were clinically reviewed in 2006 by comparison with their old clinical records. Reactions, particularly reversal reactions, occurred frequently among patients who had completed MDT within the last 3 years. It was difficult to distinguish relapse cases and late reversal reactions in skin smear-negative multibacillary cases. Based on bacteriological and histological analyses, one patient was confirmed to have relapsed 1 year after release from treatment. The overall relapse rate was 0.5%. No drug resistance mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction or dot blot hybridization. The present study indicates that it is important to follow up patients for several years after completion of MDT in order to detect possible lepra reactions and relapses.
