Although TP53 mutations are rare in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Mdm2 overexpression has been reported as an alternative cause of p53 dysfunction. We investigated the potential therapeutic use of nongenotoxic p53 activation by a small-molecule antagonist of Mdm2, Nutlin-3a, in CLL. Nutlin-3a induced significant apoptosis in 30 (91%) of 33 samples from previously untreated patients with CLL; all resistant samples had TP53 mutations. Low levels of Atm (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) or high levels of Mdm2 (murine double minute 2) did not prevent Nutlin-3a from inducing apoptosis. Nutlin-3a used transcription-dependent and transcription-independent pathways to induce p53-mediated apoptosis. Predominant activation of the transcription-independent pathway induced more pronounced apoptosis than that of the transcription-dependent pathway, suggesting that activation of the transcription-independent pathway is sufficient to initiate p53-mediated apoptosis in CLL. Combination treatment of Nutlin-3a and fludarabine synergistically increased p53 levels, and induced conformational change of Bax and apoptosis in wild-type p53 cells but not in cells with mutant p53. The synergistic apoptotic effect was maintained in samples with low Atm that were fludarabine resistant. Results suggest that the nongenotoxic activation of p53 by targeting the Mdm2-p53 interaction provides a novel therapeutic strategy for CLL.
