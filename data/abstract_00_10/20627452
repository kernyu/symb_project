BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials show that administering preoperative antibiotics prior to cesarean delivery (CD) significantly reduces the incidence of post-CD infectious morbidity. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become prevalent in obstetrics and gynecology. The objective of this trial is to examine infectious morbidity in a clinical setting before versus after implementation of a preoperative antibiotic policy and, further, to describe the organisms cultured from CD wound infections. METHODS: We used a retrospective chart review of women delivering by CD before and after implementation of preoperative antibiotic policy. RESULTS: Prior to instituting the preoperative antibiotic policy, the incidence of post-CD infectious morbidity was 20.7% and dropped to 8.5% after the policy was established (P < .001). Study cohorts were similar (P > .05) in several risk factors for infection. MRSA was the most common organism isolated from post-CD wound infections (18/34, 53%). Endomyometritis accounted for the majority of post-CD infections (143/191, 74.9%), and most infections occurred within 7 days of CD (170/191, 89.0%). CONCLUSION: The incidence of post-CD infectious complications decreased after a policy of administering preoperative antibiotics was instituted. MRSA was the most common organism isolated from post-CD wound infections. Further studies into the benefit of MRSA coverage in CD preoperative antibiotic regimens are needed.
