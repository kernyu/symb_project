Antibiotics save countless lives each year; however, increasing rates of drug-resistant bacteria have limited antibiotic selection. Currently, there are few available options for treating resistant Gram-positive organisms. Oritavancin, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic with bactericidal activity, has been developed and recently completed the first round of Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections. Investigations into oritavancin's efficacy will be explored in catheter-related bacteraemia and nosocomial pneumonia. Oritavancin demonstrates similar activity to vancomycin but possesses extended activity against vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus and Enterococcus. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oritavancin appear to be favourable and once-daily dosing is likely. The incidence of multi-drug resistant bacteria is increasing and explorations into additional treatment options are essential. Further development of oritavancin is necessary to determine clinical efficacy.
