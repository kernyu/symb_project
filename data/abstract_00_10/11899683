OBJECTIVE: An emergency-use program forof Synercid (quinupristin/dalfopristin, Q/D) has been set up following the occurrence of Gram-positive infections with no therapeutic alternatives to the available antibiotic arsenal. METHODS: The experience in France is based on a collective of 88 infections analysed in 74 patients. The most frequent clinical indications were: central catheter-related bacteremia, bone and joint infection, endocarditis and, intraabdominal infection. The most frequently causative pathogens were: S. aureus (n = 26, including 24/26 meticillin-resistant), coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 28, including 24/28 meticillin-resistant), enterococci (n = 15), and others (n = 5). Q/D was administered most frequently by central venous infusion, 3 times a day (68/74 patients); the mean and median dose per infusion was 7.4 mg/kg and the mean duration of treatment was 15.6 days. A combined antibiotic therapy was used in 70/74 patients (a glycopeptide in 41/54 staphylococcal infections). RESULTS: A Clinical success at the end of treatment was obtained in 40/74 patients (54%; CI 42.1%-65.7%) [the analysis included 25 patients (34%) with an indeterminate clinical response, categorized as failures] et and 39/73 patients (53%) at the follow-up [including 22 deaths (30%), categorized as failure at the follow-up]. The end-of-treatment success rate in patients with staphylococcal and enterococcal infections was respectively 30/54 (56%) and 8/15 (53%). The safety analysis indicated that 24/74 patients presented at least one treatment-related intercurrent event (possible or probable relationship), the most frequent ones being digestive disordersturbances, signs of venous intolerance, or diffuse or muscular pain. CONCLUSION: Q/D has demonstrated a therapeutic potential in a variety of Gram-positive infections (staphylococcal and enterococcal) in patients with no therapeutic antibiotic alternative, and the type of the intercurrent events reported was consistent with those expected ones in this population of seriously ill patients.
