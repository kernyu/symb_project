A novel, methicillin-resistant [corrected] Staphylococcus aureus clone (Uruguay clone) with a non-multidrug-resistant phenotype caused a large outbreak, including 7 deaths, in Montevideo, Uruguay. The clone was distinct from the highly virulent community clone represented by strain MW2, although both clones carried Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene and cna gene.
