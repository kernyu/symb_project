Suppression of resistance in a dense Pseudomonas aeruginosa population has previously been shown with optimized quinolone exposures. However, the relevance to beta-lactams is unknown. We investigated the bactericidal activity of meropenem and its propensity to suppress P. aeruginosa resistance in an in vitro hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM). Two isogenic strains of P. aeruginosa (wild type and an AmpC stably derepressed mutant [MIC = 1 mg/liter]) were used. An HFIM inoculated with approximately 1 x 10(8) CFU/ml of bacteria was subjected to various meropenem exposures. Maintenance doses were given every 8 h to simulate the maximum concentration achieved after a 1-g dose in all regimens, but escalating unbound minimum concentrations (C(min)s) were simulated with different clearances. Serial samples were obtained over 5 days to quantify the meropenem concentrations, the total bacterial population, and subpopulations with reduced susceptibilities to meropenem (>3x the MIC). For both strains, a significant bacterial burden reduction was seen with all regimens at 24 h. Regrowth was apparent after 3 days, with the C(min)/MIC ratio being < or = 1.7 (time above the MIC, 100%). Selective amplification of subpopulations with reduced susceptibilities to meropenem was suppressed with a C(min)/MIC of > or = 6.2 or by adding tobramycin to meropenem (C(min)/MIC = 1.7). Investigations that were longer than 24 h and that used high inocula may be necessary to fully evaluate the relationship between drug exposures and the likelihood of resistance suppression. These results suggest that the C(min)/MIC of meropenem can be optimized to suppress the emergence of non-plasmid-mediated P. aeruginosa resistance. Our in vitro data support the use of an extended duration of meropenem infusion for the treatment of severe nosocomial infections in combination with an aminoglycoside.
