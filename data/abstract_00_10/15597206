The molecular mechanisms of HIV drug resistance were studied using molecular dynamics simulations of HIV-1 protease complexes with the clinical inhibitor indinavir. One nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations were run for solvated complexes of indinavir with wild type protease, a control variant and 12 drug resistant mutants. The quality of the simulations was assessed by comparison with crystallographic and inhibition data. Molecular mechanisms that contribute to drug resistance include structural stability and affinity for inhibitor. The mutants showed a range of structural variation from 70 to 140% of the wild type protease. The protease affinity for indinavir was estimated by calculating the averaged molecular mechanics interaction energy. A correlation coefficient of 0.96 was obtained with observed inhibition constants for wild type and four mutants. Based on this good agreement, the trends in binding were predicted for the other mutants and discussed in relation to the clinical data for indinavir resistance. [figure: see text].
