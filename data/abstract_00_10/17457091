BACKGROUND: Sentinel testing programs for HIV drug resistance in resource-limited settings can inform policy on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and drug sequencing. OBJECTIVE: : To examine the value of resistance surveillance in influencing recommendations toward effective and cost-effective sequencing of ART regimens. METHODS: A state-transition model of HIV infection was adapted to simulate clinical care in Cote d'Ivoire and evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of (1) no ART; (2) ART beginning with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen followed by a boosted protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen; and (3) ART beginning with a boosted PI-based regimen followed by an NNRTI-based regimen. RESULTS: At a 5% prevalence of NNRTI resistance, a strategy that started with a PI-based regimen had a smaller health benefit and higher cost-effectiveness ratio than a strategy that started with an NNRTI-based regimen (cost-effectiveness ratio $910/year of life saved). Results consistently favored initiation with an NNRTI-based regimen, regardless of the population prevalence of NNRTI resistance (up to 76%) and the efficacy of an NNRTI-based regimen in the setting of resistance. The most influential parameters on the cost-effectiveness of sequencing strategies were boosted PI-based regimen costs and the efficacy of this regimen when used as second-line therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Drug costs and treatment efficacies, but not NNRTI resistance levels, were most influential in determining optimal HIV drug sequencing in Cote d'Ivoire. Results of surveillance for NNRTI resistance should not be used as a major guide to treatment policy in resource-limited settings.
