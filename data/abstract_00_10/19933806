Triclosan, a very widely used biocide, specifically inhibits fatty acid synthesis by inhibition of enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase. Escherichia coli FabI is the prototypical triclosan-sensitive enoyl-ACP reductase, and E. coli is extremely sensitive to the biocide. However, other bacteria are resistant to triclosan, because they encode triclosan-resistant enoyl-ACP reductase isozymes. In contrast, the triclosan resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 has been attributed to active efflux of the compound (R. Chuanchuen, R. R. Karkhoff-Schweizer, and H. P. Schweizer, Am. J. Infect. Control 31:124-127, 2003). We report that P. aeruginosa contains two enoyl-ACP reductase isozymes, the previously characterized FabI homologue plus a homologue of FabV, a triclosan-resistant enoyl-ACP reductase recently demonstrated in Vibrio cholerae. By deletion of the genes encoding P. aeruginosa FabI and FabV, we demonstrated that FabV confers triclosan resistance on P. aeruginosa. Upon deletion of the fabV gene, the mutant strain became extremely sensitive to triclosan (>2,000-fold more sensitive than the wild-type strain), whereas the mutant strain lacking FabI remained completely resistant to the biocide.
