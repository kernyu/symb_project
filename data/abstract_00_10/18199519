BACKGROUND/AIMS: We sought to identify mutations associated with treatment failure to adefovir (ADV) and to determine virologic response to tenofovir (TDF) alone and in combination with emtricitabine (FTC) in these patients. METHODS: Serum samples prior to and after the change in treatment to TDF/TDF+FTC from 13 patients were analyzed by direct sequencing and clonal analysis. RESULTS: ADV-resistant mutations, rtA181V and rtN236T, were detected on direct sequencing in 3 of 8 patients who had virologic breakthrough. Among patients with suboptimal virologic response, rtA181T, rtI233V, and rtN236T were present on clonal analysis in 3 patients. Ten patients received TDF, 8 achieved virologic response. One had ADV-resistance at baseline and persistence of ADV-resistant mutations during TDF treatment, addition of FTC resulted in a further decrease in HBV DNA. Another patient had no ADV-resistance at baseline, and selection of ADV-resistant mutations during TDF treatment. All 3 patients who received TDF+FTC had undetectable HBV DNA within 3-12 months including 2 who had ADV-resistance at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: TDF monotherapy is effective for patients with virologic breakthrough or suboptimal response to ADV, but combination therapy with a nucleoside analogue should be considered in patients with ADV-resistance. No novel mutations were detected.
