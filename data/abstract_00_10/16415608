OBJECTIVES: The intensive care unit (ICU) is a setting where a large number of drugs are administered to patients and the costs of hospitalization and drug treatment are high. Information on drug utilization in intensive care units (ICUs) are lacking in western Nepal. The present study was carried out to obtain information on the basic demographic pattern of the respondents, drug utilization during the study period, the antibiotic sensitivity patterns of isolated microorganisms and measure drug consumption in defined daily dose (DDD)/ 100 bed-days. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the ICU of the Manipal Teaching hospital, Pokhara, Nepal during the time period from 01/02/2002 to 31/05/2002 was carried out. The ICU mortality rate, length of stay greater than 7 days and median length of stay were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 259 individuals were admitted. The ICU mortality rate was 15.4%; median length of stay was 4 days. E.coli, H.influenzae, K.pneumoniae, S.aureus and P.aeruginosa were the common organisms isolated and were found to be resistant to some of the commonly used antibiotics. Mean +/- SD number of drugs and cost of drugs were 5.1 +/- 2.7 and 1958.5 +/- 1267.8 Nepalese rupees (25.1 +/- 16.2 US dollars). Total drug consumption was 356.4 DDD/100 bed-days. Consumption of intravenous fluids was 25.8 litres/100 bed-days. CONCLUSIONS: An antibiotic use policy should be framed. Formation of a multidisciplinary team to oversee drug use and periodically review microbial sensitivity patterns will be helpful. Longitudinal surveillance of ICU drug use should be carried out.
