OBJECTIVE: To determine the resistance rates of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections (HAI) or community acquired infections (CAI) in the 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in China. METHODS: 1596 strains of gram-negative bacilli from the 2401 pathogenic strains isolated from 13 hospitals 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 were collected for susceptibility test using international standard two-fold agar dilution method. According to the criteria of guidelines of NCCLS (2001), MIC(50) and MIC(90) were detected for antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and R%, I%, and S%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of bacteria to the compounds tested. RESULTS: 15 species of gram-negative pathogens were isolated and most of them could be isolated from both CAI and HAI patients. The resistance rates of isolates, especially Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia spp. and Acinetobacter spp. from HAI were higher than those of CAI. The carbopenems were the most active compounds tested against Enterobacteriaceae. Cefoperozone/sulbactam and cefprime demonstrated excellent activity against most of Gram-negative bacilli. Most of the Gram-negative bacilli were still rather susceptible to cefatazidime, a third generation cephalosporin, with a susceptibility rate of 70% to 100%. Fluoroquinolones showed strong and broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacilli, but more than 50% of Escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and the susceptible rates to fluoroquinolones of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae had decreased. CONCLUSION: (1) The results obtained in the two surveillance-years, 2000 - 2001 and 1998 - 1999, were similar in the bacterial resistance pattern and the trend of rising of resistant rates for some Gram-negative pathogens. (2) The resistance rates of isolates from HAI patients were higher than those of CAI.
