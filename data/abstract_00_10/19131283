BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Serum gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase level is often increased in patients with chronic hepatitis C, and we aimed to identify factors associated with this phenomenon in patients completely abstinent from alcohol (teetotaller). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 71 teetotaller patients have been identified by personal history, questioning of relatives, CAGE questionnaire administration and unscheduled alcoholemia measurements. RESULTS: 39 patients (55%) had elevated (>50IU/L) gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase level. Body mass index, insulin and C-peptide level, insulin resistance, piecemeal necrosis score > or =3, fibrosis score > or =2 and steatosis score > or =1 were significantly higher in these patients than in those (n=32) with normal gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. At multiple linear regression analysis gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase level was associated with C-peptide level, insulin resistance and histopathologic grading. At multiple logistic regression analysis, C-peptide level (OR=2.13) and piecemeal necrosis score > or =3 (OR=4.59) were the only factors independently associated with elevated gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. Sustained virological response during pegylated interferon plus ribavirine treatment was achieved by 97% and 49% patients with normal and elevated gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, respectively (p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: Serum gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase level is often elevated in chronic hepatitis C and is associated with metabolic and inflammatory factors; this phenomenon may contribute to explain and to predict resistance to treatment in this subgroup of patients.
