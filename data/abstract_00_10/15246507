Fifty-one clinical isolates and 5 clarithromycin-resistant mutants of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) were tested for their susceptibility to clarithromycin by microplate Alamar blue assay (MABA). The susceptibility results were compared with the results obtained by the BACTEC 460 method. All clinical isolates were susceptible, while all mutants were resistant to clarithromycin by BACTEC. Eighty-six percent of the clinical isolates were susceptible by MABA, and one of the resistant mutants was misclassified as susceptible by this method. The overall agreement between MABA and BACTEC was 86%, indicating the usefulness of MABA in drug susceptibility testing of MAC.
