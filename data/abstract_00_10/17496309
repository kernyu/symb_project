BACKGROUND: High-dose therapy (HDT) with stem-cell support is the reference treatment for relapsed lymphoma, but is not appropriate for all patients. Conventional salvage chemotherapies have been used with limited efficacy and significant toxicity. Rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin are active as single agents in relapsed or refractory lymphoma, and have demonstrated synergistic effects in vitro and in vivo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma received up to eight cycles of R-GemOx (rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 1, gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) and oxaliplatin 100 mg/m(2) on day 2). The majority (72%) had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. RESULTS: After four cycles of R-GemOx, the overall response rate was 83% [50% complete response (CR)/unconfirmed CR (CRu)]. High CR/CRu rates were observed in all histological subtypes. In patients who had previously received rituximab, the CR/CRu rate after eight cycles was 65%. The 2-year event-free and overall survival rates (median follow-up of 28 months) were 43% and 66%, respectively. Among responders, the probability of being disease free for 2 years was 62%. Treatment was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: R-GemOx shows promising activity with acceptable toxicity in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma who are not eligible for HDT.
