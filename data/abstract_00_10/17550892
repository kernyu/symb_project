There is growing universal concern regarding counterfeit medications. In particular, counterfeit antimicrobial drugs are a threat to public health with many devastating consequences for patients; increased mortality and morbidity and emergence of drug resistance. In addition, physicians treating these patients lose their confidence in the medications used and report high levels of bacterial resistance. The problem with fake and suboptimal medications got worse with the advent of the World Wide Web; a significant proportion of medications that are sold through Internet pharmacies is counterfeit.

In this article, we review the available evidence in peer-reviewed articles and World Wide Web information resources regarding the issue of counterfeit antimicrobials.
