Antibiotic resistance of heterotrophic bacteria isolated from a sandy beach in Sopot, at the Southern Baltic Sea coast was determined. The levels of resistance of bacteria to various antibiotics differed considerably. Bacteria inhabiting the middle part of the beach and the dune were most resistant; the least resistant were bacteria isolated from the sea-beach contact zone. Generally, there were no significant differences in antibiotic resistance between pigmented and non-pigmented bacteria. Bacteria isolated from the surface layer of the sand were more resistant to the tested antibiotics than bacteria from the subsurface layers. The majority of bacterial strains were resistant to 3-8 antibiotics. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics was dependent on their chemical structure.
