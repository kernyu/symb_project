The fluoroquinolone class of antimicrobials has enjoyed enormous clinical and marketing success over the past 20 years. These drugs have proven to be extremely useful in a broad range of clinical indications including both common community-acquired as well as nosocomial bacterial infections. Levofloxacin (Levaquin, Tavanic), like ciprofloxacin (Cipro), has established an enviable record of safe and efficacious use, and in many ways has become the agent against which all of the newer fluoroquinolones are judged. New clinical indications in complicated skin and skin structure infections, nosocomial pneumonia and chronic bacterial prostatitis continue to expand the important role of this already versatile drug. In addition, the use of 'short-course, high-dose' therapies are being studied in indications, such as community-acquired pneumonia, in an effort to optimize the efficacy and convenience of the drug while minimizing the future development of resistance. As the use of levofloxacin continues to expand, future challenges will include the threat of increasing antimicrobial resistance and the availability of newer alternative agents, both newer fluoroquinolones as well as agents of other antibiotic classes.
