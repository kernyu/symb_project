The role of transport activity of Acholeplasma laidlawii plasmatic membrane in the development of resistance to ciprofloxacin was investigated. It was shown that ethidium bromide used as fluoroquinolone analogue in plasmatic membrane efflux pump was accumulated in ciprofloxacin-resistant cells in much less amount. It was estimated that ethidium bromide efflux depended on temperature, glucose and transmembrane electro-chemical proton potential. Inhibitors of efflux systems--reserpine and verapamil enhanced the ethidium bromide accumulation much more intensively in ciprofloxacin resistant cells. The results of investigation allowed to consider the existence of active efflux system for toxic agents in acholeplasma; in the case of ciprofloxacin-resistant strain these systems are inducible.
