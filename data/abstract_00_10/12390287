The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a short course of oral vancomycin and intranasal mupirocin ointment in the eradication of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization. During an outbreak of MRSA, the colonized subjects received oral vancomycin and topical mupirocin. They were screened for MRSA 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after decolonization. A questionnaire was developed to evaluate the side-effects of oral vancomycin. Thirty-five subjects were treated. Clearance was achieved in all cases, in 24 (69%) subjects after one course of therapy. Twenty-eight (80%) subjects experienced some side-effects, including six (17%) who did not tolerate oral vancomycin. Although oral vancomycin, in combination with topical mupirocin, is effective in the elimination of MRSA colonization, there is a need for further studies to confirm our results and to evaluate the safety of oral vancomycin.
