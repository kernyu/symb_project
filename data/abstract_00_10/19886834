The frequency of transmitted HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) was evaluated in the context of rapid scale-up of antiretroviral treatment in Thailand, Vietnam, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, and Senegal by using an adaptation of the WHO generic protocol of the HIV Drug Resistance Threshold Survey (HIVDR-TS) for sample collection and classification. Resistance-associated mutations were interpreted using the 2009 WHO list for epidemiological surveys. We included 266 subjects from the five study sites. Of the 266 RT and PR sequences analyzed, two from Vietnam harbored virus with major drug resistance mutations (G190A in RT for one individual and M46I in PR for the second individual). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CRF01_AE predominates (>90%) in Thailand and Vietnam. CRF02 (>65%) cocirculates with other HIV-1 variants in Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire. The prevalence of HIVDRM is scored as low (< or = 5%) in all the five sites for the three drug classes analyzed. A continuous population survey for HIVDRM will provide a rational basis for maintaining or changing the current first line regimen in these countries.
