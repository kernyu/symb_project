We determined the prevalence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, especially E. coli O157, and other enteropathogens among 200 children with bloody diarrhoea and 100 age-matched controls at two Baghdad hospitals. Bacterial and parasitic agents were found in 39.5% and 28.5% of cases, respectively; no pathogen was detected in 32%. E. coli O157 was identified in 11.5% and more than one pathogen was found in 15.5% of cases. The most common pathogens were enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (5%); E. coli other than E. coli O157 or EPEC (15%); Entamoeba histolytica (25%) and Giardia lamblia (3.5%). All isolates of E. coli O157:H7 were sensitive to cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and nalidixic acid and resistant to erythromycin, polymyxin B and vancomycin. Resistance to 6 or more antimicrobial agents was common (50% of isolates).
