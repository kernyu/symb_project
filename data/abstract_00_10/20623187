A total of 310 bacterial strains isolated from the porcine gastrointestinal tract were tested for their activity against transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus and other enteric pathogens. Based on activity, the strains Probio-38 and Probio-37 were selected as potential probiotics and identified as Lactobacillus plantarum Probio-38 and Lactobacillus salivarius Probio-37 respectively by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Supernatants of these strains inhibited TGE coronavirus in vitro in ST cells, without any cytopathic effect even after 72 h of incubation. Both the strains exhibited high survival in synthetic gastric juice. The strains were resistant to 5% porcine bile and exhibited antimicrobial activity against all the 13 enteric bacterial pathogens tested. These strains also exhibited resistance to most of the antibiotics analyzed. The inhibition of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus and enteric bacterial pathogens as well as the bile tolerance, high survival in gastric juice, and the antibiotic resistance indicate that the two isolated bacterial strains are ideal probiotic candidates for animal application after proper in vivo experiments.
