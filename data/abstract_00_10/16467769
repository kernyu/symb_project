This study was undertaken to determine the patterns of antimicrobial prescription by 64 Rural Medical Practitioners (RMPs) from Bangladesh. The antimicrobial dispensing procedures followed by the local retail drug sellers along with the purchasing capacities of the patients was also assessed. All antimicrobial agents were prescribed mainly on the patient's complaints, and all available antibiotics were prescribed in inappropriate doses and duration. In most cases, the RMPs initiated treatment with a parenteral form of antibiotic, and a different oral antibiotic usually followed. Parenteral streptomycin was used most frequently in short inadequate courses. Almost half of the antibiotics were sold without any prescriptions, and even ordinary people without any knowledge of medicine asked the drug seller for specific antibiotics. This unregulated prescribing and dispensing practice has the potential risk for the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance on a global scale.
