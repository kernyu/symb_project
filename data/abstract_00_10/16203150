In order to develop structure-activity relationships and to provide access to antibacterial agents for dual action studies, a variety of aryl group-substituted 2-aryl-5-nitro-1H-indoles were synthesized and the activity of the compounds assessed as inhibitors of the NorA multidrug resistance pump in the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The NorA protein from the major facilitator superfamily of efflux pumps confers resistance to a variety of structurally dissimilar antimicrobials such as norfloxacin, ethidium bromide, berberine and acriflavin. The compound [4-benzyloxy-2-(5-nitro-1H-2-yl)-phenyl]-methanol was the most potent pump inhibitor.
