The presence of fluoroquinolone resistance-associated alterations in topoisomerase II and IV were investigated for 103 nfxC-like type Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. The most nfxC-like type isolates (98.1%) possessed the substitution of Ile for Thr-83 in GyrA. A single alteration in GyrA (Thr-83-->Ile) was the most frequently detected and the next common alteration was two alterations with Thr-83-->Ile in GyrA and Ser-87-->Leu in ParC. A novel alteration at position Glin-106 of GyrA, which was suggested to be responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance, was identified. Our study revealed that the alterations in GyrB (Glu-468-->Asp) and in ParE (Asp-419-->Asn or Glu-459-->Asp) play a complementary role in the acquisition of resistance to fluoroquinolone. There was a correlation between the ciprofloxacin MIC and the number of resistance-associated alterations in GyrA, GyrB, ParC and ParE of P. aeruginosa isolates.
