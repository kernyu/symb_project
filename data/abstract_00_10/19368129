Enterococcus faecalis is recognized as a multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen. The phenotypic basis for this is largely uncharacterized. The intrinsic efflux system of the antibiotic-susceptible E. faecalis ATCC29212 strain was studied using a semi-automated method that assesses accumulation and efflux of the universal efflux pump substrate ethidium bromide (EB). The results show that the intrinsic efflux system of this Enterococcus strain is controlled by energy derived from the catabolism of glucose and the proton concentration of the medium. At pH 5, agents that inhibit efflux pumps in Gram-positive organisms and the proton gradient un-coupler CCCP do not increase accumulation nor inhibit efflux of EB. In contrast, at pH 8, where the proton concentration is 1,000-fold lower, these agents increase accumulation and efflux of EB. These results are relevant to infections produced by E. faecalis and subsequent antibiotic therapy with antibiotics to which the organism is known to be intrinsically resistant.
