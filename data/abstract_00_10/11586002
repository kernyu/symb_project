The four major factors predisposing individuals to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and a high alcohol intake. The elderly are also at increased risk of severe infection. The introduction of fluoroquinolones with increased activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and other CAP pathogens has been an important development, with recent guidelines recommending the use of respiratory fluoroquinolones as a first-line choice in outpatients with modifying factors, nursing home residents, and hospitalised patients in medical wards. Of the fluoroquinolones currently available that have antipneumococcal activity, levofloxacin is well tolerated and effective. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of CAP and widespread use has shown it to be very safe.
