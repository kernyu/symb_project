Vascular aging is characterized by increased oxidative stress and proinflammatory phenotypic alterations. Metabolic stress, such as hyperglycemia in diabetes, is known to increase the production of ROS and promote inflammatory gene expression, accelerating vascular aging. The oxidative stress hypothesis of aging predicts that vascular cells of long-lived species exhibit lower steady-state production of ROS and/or superior resistance to the prooxidant effects of metabolic stress. We tested this hypothesis using two taxonomically related rodents, the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and the house mouse (Mus musculus), which show a more than twofold difference in maximum lifespan potential (8.2 and 3.5 yr, respectively). We compared interspecies differences in steady-state and high glucose (HG; 30 mmol/l)-induced production of O(2)(*-) and H(2)O(2), endothelial function, mitochondrial ROS generation, and inflammatory gene expression in cultured aortic segments. In P. leucopus aortas, steady-state endothelial O(2)(*-) and H(2)O(2) production and ROS generation by mitochondria were less than in M. musculus vessels. Furthermore, vessels of P. leucopus were more resistant to the prooxidant effects of HG. Primary fibroblasts from P. leucopus also exhibited less steady-state and HG-induced ROS production than M. musculus cells. In M. musculus arteries, HG elicited significant upregulation of inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1). In contrast, the proinflammatory effects of HG were blunted in P. leucopus vessels. Thus, increased life span potential in P. leucopus is associated with decreased cellular ROS generation and increased resistance to prooxidant and proinflammatory effects of metabolic stress, which accord with predictions of the oxidative stress hypothesis of aging.
