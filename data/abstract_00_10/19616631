This study reports the effect of aqueous, ethanol and methanol triherbal solvent extract from Azadirachta indica, Ocimum sanctum and Curcuma longa on innate immune mechanisms such as phagocytosis activity, respiratory burst activity, alternative complement activity and lysozyme activity and disease resistance in goldfish (Carassius auratus) against Aeromonas hydrophila. Fish were intraperitoneally injected with different doses of 0, 5, 50 and 100 mg kg(-1) body weight of each triherbal solvent extracts. The functional immunity in terms of percentage mortality and Relative Percent Survival (RPS) and innate immune response was assessed on week 1, 2 and 4 by challenging with live A. hydrophila (1 x 10(7) cells ml(-1)). All the chosen innate immune parameters were enhanced in the ethanol and methanol triherbal solvent extract treatment after week 2. However, the aqueous triherbal extract was enhanced only after week 4. The ethanol and methanol triherbal solvent extracts administration preceding the challenge with live A. hydrophila decreased the percentage mortality in the experimental groups with the consequence increase in RPS values. The study indicates that all the doses of ethanol or methanol triberbal solvent extracts could be positively influence the immune response and protect the heath status of goldfish against A. hydrophila infection.
