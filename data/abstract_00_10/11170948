Linezolid, the first oxazolidinone, is active against gram-positive bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains. This multinational, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of linezolid with vancomycin in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia. A total of 203 patients received intravenous linezolid, 600 mg twice daily, plus aztreonam, and 193 patients received vancomycin, 1 g intravenously twice daily, plus aztreonam for 7-21 days. Clinical and microbiological outcomes were evaluated at test of cure 12-28 days after treatment. Clinical cure rates (71 [66.4%] of 107 for linezolid vs. 62 [68.1%] of 91 for vancomycin) and microbiological success rates (36 [67.9%] of 53 vs. 28 [71.8%] of 39, respectively) for evaluable patients were equivalent between treatment groups. Eradication rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and safety evaluations were similar between treatment groups. Resistance to either treatment was not detected. Linezolid is a well-tolerated, effective treatment for adults with gram-positive nosocomial pneumonia.
