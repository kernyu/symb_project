Pseudomonas aeruginosa offers substantial therapeutic challenges due to its high intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics and its propensity to develop mutational and/or adaptive resistance. The PA14 comprehensive mutant library was screened for mutants exhibiting either two- to eightfold increased susceptibilities (revealing genes involved in intrinsic resistance) or decreased susceptibilities (mutational resistance) to the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Thirty-five and 79 mutants with increased and decreased susceptibilities, respectively, were identified, as confirmed by broth dilution.
