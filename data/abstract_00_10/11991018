The susceptibility of urinary pathogens to common antibiotics was investigated and the results analysed retrospectively using the WHONET computer program. Of 1776 urine samples (44 catheterized) processed, 510 (28.7%) urinary pathogens were isolated. Of these 510 positive cultures, 455 (89.2%) were gram-negative bacilli, 45 (8.8%) Candida species and 10 (1.9%) gram-positive cocci. Of the 44 catheterized samples, 32 (72.7%) yielded significant bacteriuria and these were mainly gram-negative bacteria (24/32). The commonest pathogen isolated was Escherichia coli (47.3%) followed by Klebsiella species (10.3%), non-fermenters other than Pseudomonas species (9%), Candida species (8.8%), Providentia species (7%), Pseudomonas species (5.6%), Citrobacter species (3.7%), Enterobacter species (3.3%) and Proteus species (2.5%). The isolation of gram-negative bacteria among inpatients and outpatients was 71.6% and 28.3%, respectively. The critical care unit, nephrourology, obstetric and gynaecology, medical and surgical wards were found to be high-risk areas constituting 58.7% of the major isolates. The highest and lowest mean resistance among gram-negative bacteria to common antibiotics was 93.5% to ampicillin and to 61% gentamicin. The mean resistance to norfloxacin, amoxy-clavulanic acid, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cefazolin was 65%, 67%, 75.5%, 76% and 77.5%, respectively. The most resistant pathogen to common antibiotics was found to be Proteus species (resistance 80% and above). Overall susceptibility testing demonstrated decreased usefulness of common antibiotics and demonstrates a need for a re-evaluation of common antibiotics used in the therapy for urinary tract infection.
