Combination therapy for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis has increasingly been advocated as a way to increase treatment efficacy and tolerance, to reduce treatment duration and cost, and to limit the emergence of drug resistance. In the present work, we have adopted a rational approach, which can modulate the immune response to overcome the negative control systems and to boost the positive killing responses. This study was designed to investigate the immunomodulatory effect of picroliv (standardized fraction from the alcoholic extract of root and rhizome of Picrorhiza kurroa) on a combination of paromomycin and miltefosine using Leishmania donovani/hamster model. Picroliv has significantly enhanced antileishmanial efficacy and lymphocyte proliferation when given in combination with paromomycin and miltefosine. Increased toxic oxygen metabolite generation and phagocytosis were also witnessed. Present study thus establishes the possible use of picroliv as adjunct to antileishmanial chemotherapy.
