A total of 73 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (26 - MRSA, 47 - MSSA) were tested for their susceptibility to macrolide antibiotics and new derivatives (azalide - azythromycin and ketolide -telithromycin). We observed a high - level resistance of MRSA isolates to all tested antibiotics. Over 96% of isolates were resistant to macrolides and azalides and 92,3% to ketolides. Majority of MSSA isolates (93.6%) demonstrated a high-level susceptibility to telithromycin. Mechanisms of resistance to macrolide antibiotics (34 - MLSB and 1 - MSB) were found among 47,9% Staphylococcus aureus isolates. All of MSSA (100%) and 40% MRSA isolates with induction phenotype of resistance (MLSB(I)) were sensitive to telithromycin. Isolates with constitutive phenotype of resistance (MLSB(K)) were resistant to all of the tested antibiotics.
