The DNA microarrays or microchips are sets of DNA probes bound to a solid support in a prefixed and regular disposition. The target nucleic acid that can be detected is either DNA or RNA, which is previously labeled with a fluorochrome or a radioactive compound. The main advantage with respect to other molecular biological tools, such as polymerase chain reaction, is that thousands of genes can be detected in a single procedure. The application of the DNA arrays in the field of clinical microbiology is so far scarce. Among the specific applications we can point out: 1. Investigation of bacterial pathogenesis; 2. Analysis of bacterial evolution and molecular epidemiology; 3. Study of the mechanisms of action and resistance to antimicrobial agents and 4. Microbiological diagnostic of the infectious diseases. This methodology is still in an embryonic phase with respect to its application in clinical microbiology. However, it presents a series of advantages that make it very attractive and in the future it may become a valuable tool for the diagnosis of infectious diseases.
