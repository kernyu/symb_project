OBJECTIVE: The combination of amine fluoride and stannous fluoride (AmF/SnF2) was, by chance, found to be antifungal in a clinical trial. This study investigated its effect on pathogenic Candida species with the hypothesis that the antifungal action on different species is variable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Growth inhibition effect of Meridol mouth rinse which contains 250 ppm AmF/SnF2 was evaluated on 43 reference and clinical strains of Candida albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis. Meridol base solution without AmF/SnF2 was used as a negative control. RESULTS: Undiluted Meridolmouth rinse killed most study strains within a few minutes. In ascending order, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. dubliniensis showed higher resistance against AmF/SnF2 than C. guilliermondii. CONCLUSION: AmF/SnF2 could be used as a potent adjunct to antifungal therapy for oral yeasts. Although different Candida species demonstrated variable sensitivity the most prevalent oral yeast C. albicans appeared sensitive to the AmF/SnF2 combination.
