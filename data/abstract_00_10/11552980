The pyrimidine analogue cytosine arabinoside (AraC) is one of the most effective drugs used in the treatment of acute leukaemia. Overexpression of the multidrug resistance (MDR-1) gene and its product, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is associated with cellular resistance to drugs, such as anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids. This resistance can be reversed by cyclosporine analogues or verapamil (ver). We investigated the in vitro cross-resistance to AraC in a doxorubicin-resistant HL60 cell line, with an elevated expression of the MDR-1 gene. The resistant clone showed an eightfold increased resistance to AraC and a two- to fourfold resistance to the other analogues, as measured by cytotoxicity test. There was no significant increase in the activity of 5'-nucleotidase or in the amount of deoxyribonucleotide pools between cell lines. We could, however, detect a reduction in deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) activity (30%, P = 0.021, using deoxycytidine as substrate) and the level of AraC triphosphates was significantly reduced in the resistant cells (70%, P = 0.009). When the cells were exposed to cyclosporin A (CsA) or the cyclosporine analogue PSC 833 (PSC) in combination with AraC, there was more extensive apoptosis, as measured by formation of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and caspase-3-like activity, than with exposure to AraC alone. We also found an increased retention of AraC in the resistant cells when incubated with AraC in combination with CsA. Ver in combination with AraC, failed to increase apoptosis for the resistant cell line. Our data suggests that the resistance to AraC for the P-gp-expressing cells is a result of a reduction of dCK activity and an increase in efflux, the latter possibly depending on P-gp. A combination of CsA or PSC with AraC may improve the effect of AraC in vivo.
