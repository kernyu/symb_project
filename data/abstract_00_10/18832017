A chloroform fraction prepared from the sarcotesta of Ginkgo biloba showed potent inhibitory activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). The active compounds were elucidated to be 2-hydroxy-6-(8-pentadecenyl) salicylic acid (1) and 2-hydroxy-6-(10-heptadecenyl) salicylic acid (2) based on their spectral analysis. Compounds 1 and 2 showed significant antibacterial activities against VRE.
