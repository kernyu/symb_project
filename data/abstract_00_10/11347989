Reconstituted orange juice inoculated with Salmonella Anatum, Salmonella Infantis, Salmonella Newport, or Salmonella Stanley was treated with gamma radiation at 2 degrees C. To determine the relationship between juice antioxidant power and Dgamma (dose required to achieve 90% mortality), juice solids were removed prior to inoculation by centrifugation and/or filtration to create juice preparations of varying turbidity. In unadulterated orange juice, Salmonella Anatum (Dgamma = 0.71 kGy) was significantly more resistant than the other species tested. Salmonella Newport (Dgamma = 0.48 kGy) and Salmonella Infantis (Dgamma = 0.35 kGy) were significantly different, while Salmonella Stanley (Dgamma = 0.38 kGy) was intermediate between the two. Neither the resistance of each isolate nor the pattern of relative resistance among isolates was altered in reduced turbidity juice preparations. Although total antioxidant power was associated with the level of juice solids resuspended in phosphate buffer, antioxidant power was not significantly associated with turbidity in the juice preparations or with Dgamma of any species. The variable resistance to irradiation of the Salmonella isolates suggests this as a more significant factor than turbidity or antioxidant power in designing antimicrobial juice irradiation protocols.
