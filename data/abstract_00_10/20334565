The effect of enfuvirtide (ENF) in 11 HIV-1 heavily antiretroviral-experienced children and adolescents enrolled in the HIV-1 Paediatric Spanish cohort was further investigated. Patients who received ENF with novel drugs (etravirine, darunavir, and/or tipranavir) reached and maintained undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and showed immunological recovery within the first 3 months of therapy that was maintained during the follow-up. Viremia was not fully suppressed in patients who did not combine ENF with novel drugs but interestingly, immunological benefit was observed in half of these patients. Therefore, ENF showed a greater and more stable efficacy when administrated with novel drugs.
