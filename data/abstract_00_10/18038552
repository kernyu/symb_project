In order to determine the influence of combined use of ciprofloxacin and oxytocin on susceptibility of microflora to antibiotics as well as level of microbial anti-lysozyme (ALA) and anti-complement activity (ACA) 148 anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms were isolated from 80 patients with purulent infections of soft tissues. Susceptibility of staphylococci, streptococci, and enterobacteria to the most commonly used antibiotics was assessed by agar-diffusion method with standard disks. ALA and ACA of the isolated strains were defined by routine methods. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin and oxytocin for isolated pathogens were determined according to standards of NCCLS. Influence of oxytocin on MIC of ciprofloxacin was determined as well as inhibitory effect of the latter on factors of bacterial persistence. Decrease of MIC of ciprofloxacin as well as increase of its inhibitory effect on pathogens' ALA and ACA when it used in combination with oxytocin were noted. Usefulness of combined use of ciprofloxacin and oxytocin for treatment of different infections has been proposed.
