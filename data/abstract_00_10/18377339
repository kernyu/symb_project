BACKGROUND: Acne results from the interplay of several pathophysiologic factors, in particular seborrhoea, follicular hyperkeratosis, propionibacteria and inflammation. Recently, it has become clear that inflammatory events are important not only in the course, but also in the initiation of the disease. OBJECTIVE: The study undertook an evaluation of the effectiveness of currently available pharmacotherapeutic treatment options for acne. METHODS: After a Medline-based literature search, this article critically reviewed substances used topically (among others, retinoids, antimicrobials, salicylic acid and azelaic acid) and systemically (antibiotics, isotretinoin, hormones and zinc) as well as their combinations with respect to pharmacology, clinical efficacy and side effects. RESULTS: Modern acne pharmacotherapy provides substances that antagonize one or more of the major pathophysiologic factors of acne. When the clinical picture but also patients' motivation and wishes are appropriately considered, current pharmacotherapy of acne is rational and effective.
