A new indanone derivative (1) and two new diterpenoids (2 and 3), together with three known flavonoids, have been isolated from an ethanol extract of the leaves of Croton steenkampianus. The structure of 2 was solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, whereas those of 1 and 3 were established mainly by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic methods. The isolated compounds were tested for their antiplasmodial activity and cytotoxicity. Antiplasmodial assays against chloroquine-susceptible strains (D10 and D6) and the chloroquine-resistant strains (Dd2 and W2) of Plasmodium falciparum showed that compound 2 gave moderate activities at 9.1-15.8 muM, while none of the compounds were cytotoxic against Vero cells.
