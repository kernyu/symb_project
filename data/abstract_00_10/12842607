The effects of including bovine lactoferrin (Lf) in the diet of the Asian catfish (Clarias batrachus) on specific and non-specific immunity as well as disease resistance were investigated. The catfish were fed four different diets for 2 weeks: a commercial diet as control and the same diet supplemented with 50, 100 and 200mg bovine Lf/kg feed. After 1 and 2 weeks, serum bacterial agglutination titre against Aeromonas hydrophila as a measure of specific immunity; natural serum haemolysin titre, lysozyme activity and oxidative radical production by neutrophils as a measure of non-specific immunity as well as disease resistance against A. hydrophila challenge to vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals were evaluated. The results showed that Lf supplements, particularly at 100mg level, significantly (P<0.05) enhanced serum lysozyme level, oxidative radical production and level of protection against A. hydrophila challenge in non-vaccinated animals irrespective of length of exposure. The specific immunity was not influenced by Lf feeding as evidenced from the bacterial agglutination titre and level of protection in vaccinated animals. As Lf feeding at 100mg/kg for 1 week is able to enhance the non-specific immunity and disease resistance of catfish efficiently, these results support the possible use of Lf as an immunostimulant for farmed catfish.
