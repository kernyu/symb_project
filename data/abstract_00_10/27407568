Acinetobacter spp are ubiquitous aerobic Gram negative coccobacillus, that are now increasingly responsible for a large number of nosocomial infections. In our study, over a period of six months (Jan-Jun 2000) at a tertiary care hospital, 152 (12.9%) isolates of Acinetobacter spp were obtained from a total of 1175 isolates grown from all clinical specimens. Most of the isolates 126 (82.9%) were from hospitalised patients in the spinal cord injury centre, intensive care units and those on prior antibiotic therapy. Community acquired infections were also seen in 26 (17.1%) out patient department (OPD) cases. Isolates were from urine, respiratory exudates, blood and pus/burn wound swabs predominantly. They were resistant to commonly used antibiotics while being sensitive to amikacin, augmentin, piperacillin, netilmicin and cefotaxime. 69.2% isolates exhibited resistance to two or more antibiotics. Clinical co-relation must be under taken to exclude commensal contaminants, before considering it to be a pathogen and prescribing antibiotics to the patient.
