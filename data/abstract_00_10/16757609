We evaluated a new protocol for the BacT/ALERT MB susceptibility test (bioMerieux Inc., Durham, NC) using 80 Mycobacterium tuberculosis WHO challenge panel strains. The drug susceptibility profiles of these strains are well characterized, and consensus drug resistance results have been established after tests were performed at around 20 international reference laboratories using recommended reference drug susceptibility techniques. Strains were tested according to the bioMerieux protocol using the following critical concentrations: rifampin (RIF), 0.9 mg/liter; isoniazid (INH), 0.4 and 0.09 mg/liter; and ethambutol (EMB), 1.8 mg/liter. The BacT/ALERT system detected 36/37 RIF-resistant strains. For INH (low concentration), 59/59 resistant strains were detected, and for EMB, 34/34 resistant strains were detected. Thus, the sensitivities were 97%, 100%, and 100% for RIF, INH, and EMB, respectively. The corresponding specificities were 100%, 95%, and 98%, respectively, for the same drugs. As soon as the BacT/ALERT MP seed bottle flagged positive, the median time to obtain a susceptibility results was 7.8 days. The results show good concordance with the consensus results of the international reference laboratories and demonstrate that BacT/ALERT 3D should be considered as an alternative method for rapid and automated drug susceptibility testing of M. tuberculosis.
