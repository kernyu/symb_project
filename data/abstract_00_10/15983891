OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of salvage regimens containing ritonavir-boosted amprenavir (APV/r) or fosamprenavir (FPV/r) in heavily pretreated protease inhibitor (PI)-experienced HIV-1 patients. METHOD: Evaluation of APV/r- or FPV/r-containing antiretroviral regimens in PI-experienced HIV-1 patients with 2 or more antiretroviral failures. Follow-up continued to 96 weeks with prospective collection of data. RESULTS: 54 episodes (48 on APV/r and 6 on FPV/r) were considered in 45 patients who had received a median of 5 prior antiretroviral regimens (range, 2-13) including a median of 3 PIs (range, 2-4). Median time of treatment at analysis was 72 weeks (range, 12-210). At baseline, plasma viral load (pVL) and CD4 cell count was 67,000 copies/mL and 167 cell/mm(3), respectively. At week 96, the median pVL was < 50 copies/mL and CD4 cell count was 519 cells/mm(3). Proportion of patients with pVL below detection was 62% at week 48 and 61% at week 96. Fifteen patients stopped treatment because of virologic failure; one presented a full resistance profile to APV/r, based on the ANRS 2003 resistance algorithm. Median trough APV plasma concentration 4 weeks after treatment initiation was 1406 ng/mL (range, 452-4321); dose adaptation was required in only 7 patients. CONCLUSION: This study provides long-term follow-up of APV/r and FPV/r in the setting of salvage therapy, showing a high and sustained rate of virologic and immunologic response.
