Forty-nine protease inhibitor (PI)-experienced but amprenavir (APV)-naive patients experiencing virological failure were treated with ritonavir (RTV) (100 mg twice a day [b.i.d.]) plus APV (600 mg b.i.d.). Patients responded to therapy with a median viral load decrease of -1.32 log(10) by week 12. The addition of low-dose RTV enhanced the minimal APV concentration in plasma (APV C(min)) up to 10-fold compared with that obtained with APV (1,200 mg b.i.d.) without RTV. Baseline PI resistance mutations (L10F/I/V, K20M/R, E35D, R41K, I54V, L63P, V82A/F/T/S, I84V) identified by univariate analysis and included in a genotypic score and APV C(min) at week 8 were predictive of the virological response at week 12. The response to APV plus RTV was significantly reduced in patients with six or more of the resistance mutations among the ones defined above. The genotypic inhibitory quotient, calculated as the ratio of the APV C(min) to the number of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease mutations, was a better predictor than the virological or pharmacological variables used alone. This genotypic inhibitory quotient could be used in therapeutic drug monitoring to define the concentrations in plasma needed to control replication of viruses with different levels of PI resistance, as measured by the number of PI resistance mutations.
