Many studies have shown a considerable reduction in enamel bond strength of resin composite restorations when the bonding procedure is carried out immediately after bleaching. These studies claim that a certain waiting period is needed prior to restoration to reach the original bond strength values prior to bleaching. This study determined the effect of anti-oxidant applications on the bond strength values of resin composites to bleached dentin. Ninety human teeth extracted for orthodontic purposes were used in this study. The labial surface of each tooth was ground and flattened until dentin appeared. The polished surfaces were subjected to nine different treatments: 1) bleaching with gel (35% Rembrandt Virtuoso); 2) bleaching with gel + 10% sodium ascorbate (SA); 3) bleaching with gel + 10% butylhydroxyanisole (BHA); 4) bleaching with sol (35% hydrogen peroxide); 5) bleaching with sol + 10% sodium ascorbate; 6) bleaching with sol + 10% BHA; 7) bleaching with gel + immersed in artificial saliva for seven days; 8) bleaching with sol + immersed in artificial saliva for seven days; 9) no treatment. After bonding application, the resin composite in standard dimensions was applied to all specimens. The teeth were stored in distilled water at 37 degrees C for 24 hours and a universal testing machine determined their resistance to shear bond strength. The data was evaluated using ANOVA and Duncan tests. Bond strength in the bleached dentin group significantly decreased compared to the control group. On the other hand, the antioxidant treatment had a reversal effect on the bond strength to dentin. After the bleaching treatment, the 10% sodium ascorbate application was effective in reversing bond strength. In the samples where antioxidant was applied after the bleaching process, bonding strength in dentin tissue was at the same level as those teeth kept in artificial saliva for seven days.
