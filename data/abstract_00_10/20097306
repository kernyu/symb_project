In Bangladesh, despite the official introduction of artemisinin combination therapy in 2004, chloroquine+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been used for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. To assess the distribution of pfcrt, pfmdr1, dhfr, and dhps genotypes in Plasmodium falciparum, we conducted hospital- and community-based surveys in Bandarban, Bangladesh (near the border with Myanmar) in 2007 and 2008. Using nested PCR followed by digestion, 139 P. falciparum isolates were genotyped. We found fixation of a mutation at position 76 in pfcrt and low prevalence of a mutation at position 86 in pfmdr1. In dhfr, the highest pyrimethamine resistant genotype quadruple mutant was found in 19% of isolates, which is significantly higher prevalence than reported in a previous study in Khagrachari (1%) in 2002. Microsatellite haplotypes flanking dhfr of the quadruple mutants in Bangladesh were identical or very similar to those found in Thailand and Cambodia, indicating a common origin for the mutant in these countries. These observations suggest that the higher prevalence of the dhfr quadruple mutant in Bandarban is because of parasite migration from Myanmar. However, continuous use of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine would have also played a role through selection for the dhfr quadruple mutant. These results indicate an urgent need to collect molecular epidemiological information regarding dhfr and dhps genes, and a review of current sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine usage with the aim of avoiding the widespread distribution of high levels of resistant parasites in Bangladesh.
