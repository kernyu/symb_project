New antiviral drugs, therapeutic vaccines and immunotherapies are interesting therapeutic option for treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and clevudine are very effective in suppressing viral load with lack of resistance at short term. However antiviral drug rarely eliminate the virus. Immunotherapies by inducing HBV - specific T-cell responses may contribute to virus control. Adoptive T-cell therapy is an interesting approach to eliminate persistently infected cells. Therapeutic vaccines with either protein-based or DNA vaccines induce an HBV - specific T-cell responses leading to a more often transient decrease of viral load. Combination of antiviral drug and therapeutic vaccines may be an interesting therapeutic option. However additional larger scale and more systematic studies of the understanding of HBV specific T-cell response have to be performed in order to select which patient can benefit of such therapies.
