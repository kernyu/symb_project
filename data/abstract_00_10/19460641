Parasitism in New World camelids (NWC), which is associated with both ecto- and endoparasites, is a major health concern throughout the world. Clinical disease has been noted as causing severe economic losses; subclinical issues have yet to be addressed. Despite the advances made in the knowledge and understanding of parasites of NWC, old parasites continue to plague producers, and new issues have arisen. This article updates information on the major ecto- and endoparasites of NWC, including diagnostic techniques and issues relative to anthelmintic resistance in nematodes.
