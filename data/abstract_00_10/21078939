The prevalence of heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (hVISA) is 1.3% in published studies. Clinical associations include high-inoculum infections and glycopeptide failure, with hVISA infections associated with a 2.37-times-greater failure rate (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53 to 3.67) compared to vancomycin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (VSSA) infections. Despite this, 30-day mortality rates were similar to those for VSSA infections (odds ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.74). The optimal therapy for hVISA requires further study.
