The specific features of disseminated pulmonary tuberculosis were studied in patients isolating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) with a high (n = 135) and low (n = 50) viability. The degree of the pathogen's viability was shown to determine the clinical characteristics of a specific process and the efficiency of its treatment. It is speculated that there is a direct relationship between the viability ofmycobacteria and their virulence. There are differences in the nature of primary drug resistance in MBT with their varying variability.
