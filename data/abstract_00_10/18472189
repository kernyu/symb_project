A series of novel 2-substituted benzimidazoles and imidazoles have been synthesized from long-chain alkenoic acids. The reactions occurred under relatively mild conditions and afforded the desired product in good yields. The structures of these compounds have been elucidated by elemental and spectral (IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, mass) analyses. Furthermore, compounds were screened for in vitro antibacterial activity against the representative panel of two gram-positive and two gram-negative bacteria. All the synthesized compounds were also tested for their inhibitory action against five strains of fungus. The various compounds show potent inhibitory action against test organisms.
