Due to the ever-increasing number of immunocompromised patients, both localised and life-threatening systemic fungal infections are on the increase. Conventional treatment is of limited help, not in the least due to a less optimum benefit-to-risk ratio. Moreover, emerging pathogens with reduced antimicrobial susceptibility and the development of resistance in Candida albicans form a new challenge. Fortunately, conventional antimycotics have been improved and entirely new ones are on the horizon as well as alternative approaches such as immunoreconstitution.
