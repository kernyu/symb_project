Some growth parameters and bacteriocin production by the strain Pediococcus acidilactici 13, were screened in this study. The inhibitor substance produced by this strain showed strong antimicrobial activity at 204,800 AU/mL (Activity Units/mL) against the gram positive food borne pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, when the incubation temperature was 37 degrees C and the initial pH of the medium, TGE (Trypton Glucose Yeast Extract), was 6.0. The bacteriocin-producing strain had considerable resistance NaCl, since the strain maintained to growth up to 10% NaCl concentrations at TGE broth and was able to grow in a wide temperature range (25-50 degrees C). The strain was identified as P. acidilactici with API 50 CHL, as well as with 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
