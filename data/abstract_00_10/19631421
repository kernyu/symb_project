INTRODUCTION: The effect of porin loss and inoculum size on the comparative activity of ertapenem against either extended-spectrum beta lactamase-producing (ESBL) or plasmid-mediated AmpC beta lactamase-producing (pACBL) Klebsiella pneumoniae strains was evaluated. METHODS: Microdilution using 2 different bacterial inocula. RESULTS: Imipenem, amikacin, ertapenem, and cefepime were the most active agents under standard conditions. Ertapenem was more highly affected by porin loss than imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: Ertapenem showed high activity against K. pneumoniae strains expressing ESBL, pACBL or both. Strains deficient in porins showed decreased susceptibility to beta lactams. The inoculum effect had a greater impact on imipenem than on ertapenem.
