A total of 30,634 global Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected from the MYSTIC (Meropenem Yearly Surveillance Test Information Collection) Programme were tested using a reference methodology against meropenem and seven other broad-spectrum agents commonly used in the hospital setting (1997-2003). The most active compound was meropenem (99.6% susceptible), followed by imipenem (98.4%), cefepime (94.0%), gentamicin (86.8%), piperacillin/tazobactam (85.8%), ceftazidime (85.0%), ciprofloxacin (84.6%), and tobramycin (84.5%). Continued surveillance of antimicrobial compounds' in vitro activity is necessary to recommend regimens that are likely to be effective in clinical practice.
