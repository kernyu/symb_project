This study concerns the cloning, characterization, and expression of the lysin (LysK) from staphylococcal phage K in Lactococcus lactis. Lactococcal lysates containing recombinant LysK were found to inhibit a range of different species of staphylococci isolated from bovine and human infection sources, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. LysK thus has potential as an antimicrobial for applications in the prevention and/or treatment of infections caused by staphylococci.
