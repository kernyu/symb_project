Ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates (n = 1,858) from outpatient midstream urine specimens at 40 North American clinical laboratories in 2004 to 2005 were frequently resistant to ampicillin (79.8% of isolates) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (66.5%); concurrent resistance to cefdinir (9.0%) or nitrofurantoin (4.0%) was less common. Only 10.8% of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin alone. Fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates of E. coli from urine were frequently multidrug resistant.
