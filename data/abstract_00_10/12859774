AIMS: To determine the incidence of transfer of a naturally occurring rifampicin-resistant strain of Escherichia coli (RREC) among cattle in a research feedlot. METHODS AND RESULTS: During three separate experiments, steers in three different pens were orally inoculated with RREC originally isolated from bovine faeces. Faecal swabs were performed on all steers in the feedlot at approximately 5 week intervals thereafter. Faecal grab samples were collected from steers in the inoculated and the immediately adjacent pens for up to 4 months. In all three experiments, the inoculated steers and penmates shed RREC within 48 h, and then shed intermittently throughout the sampling periods. Transfer of RREC to steers in an adjacent pen was confirmed only during the first experiment, but never to those in non-adjacent pens. All recovered RREC isolates were compared with the inoculated strain using multiple methods indicating that all RREC isolates were descendants of the original inoculated strain. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of the RREC strain on the pen floor and within the animal handling system, but not in the feed troughs or water bowls, suggests faecal-oral to be the primary mode of transmission among animals. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results suggest that in the absence of selective pressure, antibiotic-resistant bacteria may persist in cattle for a short duration but widespread transfer among cattle in a feedlot environment may be an exception rather than the norm. Modifications to feedlot management are discussed.
