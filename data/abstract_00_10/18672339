OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to screen Staphylococcus aureus negative for production of coagulase or clumping factor and for presence of selected adhesin genes. METHODS: Sixty coagulase-negative and 20 clumping factor-negative S. aureus strains were studied. Detection of methicillin resistance was performed using the agar screen technique with 6 mg/L of oxacillin and was confirmed by amplification mecA gene. The presence of bone binding protein (bbp), collagen binding protein (cna), fibronectin A binding protein (fnbA), fibronectin B binding protein (fnbB) and clumping factor A (clfA) genes was detected by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Almost all (98%) of the strains were positive for clfA gene. There were fnbA and fnibB in 85%, cna in 54% and bbp in 5% of strains found. No correlation between presence of the particular genes and clinical samples was observed. The prevalence of fnbA, fnbB and cna was statistically higher in coagulase-negative than in clumping factor-negative strains (89, 89, 66 and 70, 70, 15%, respectively). Similarly, all of these genes were more often observed in MRSA than in MSSA atypical strains. The cna was detected only in coagulase-negative MRSA.
