Susceptibility to levofloxacin of 56 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, isolated from 22 patients with first estimated and 84 patients with chronic tuberculosis was investigated. Ratio of multi-drug resistance achieved 54.5 per cent in first group and 94.1 per cent in the second group. 23 (41.1 per cent) isolated strains belonged to individual genotypes, 33 (58.9 per cent)--to Beijing group. All mycobacteria isolates were sensitive to critical concentration of levofloxacin--10 mcg/mL. The results of the investigation proves the ability to recommend levofloxacin application at the patients with first estimated tuberculosis and at the patients with most hazardous tuberculosis pathogen of Beijing group.
