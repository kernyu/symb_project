Two Tn551 insertional mutants with reduced methicillin resistance were isolated from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus KSA8. These two mutants showed increased susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics and bacitracin, but not to fosfomycin and vancomycin. Tn551 in these mutants was inserted into the same gene, termed fmtC. The fmtC gene has an open reading frame of 840 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular mass of 96.9 kDa. The N-terminal half of the deduced FmtC protein is very hydrophobic, implying that this protein is a membrane-associated protein.
