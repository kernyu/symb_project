Analysis of hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from a tertiary public hospital in Singapore revealed that multisusceptible strains had gradually started to replace the endemic multiresistant strain (ST239-MRSA-III) since 2002. Molecular typing showed that this was a predominantly clonal outbreak of a UK-EMRSA-15 strain (ST22-MRSA-IV).
