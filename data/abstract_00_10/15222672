The treatment of gram-negative infection of the central nervous system (CNS) presents a clinical challenge due to antibiotic resistance and difficulties with penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Two patients with gram-negative CNS infections were treated successfully with high-dose, prolonged infusions of meropenem. The CSF meropenem concentrations exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration of the pathogen for virtually the entire dosing interval in both cases. Our experience demonstrates that dosage modification to maximize pharmacodynamic targets and bactericidal activity may be practically applied to optimize antibiotic treatment for difficult-to-treat CNS infections.
