Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis has become the surgical treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis or ulcerative colitis with dysplasia and for the majority of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. However, pouchitis and other pouch-associated complications frequently occur following surgery. Pouchitis is the most common long-term complication of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in patients with ulcerative colitis, with a cumulative prevalence of up to 50%. The pathogenesis of pouchitis is probably associated with alterations in commensal bacterial flora, and most patients with pouchitis respond favorably to antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for active pouchitis, with ciprofloxacin or metronidazole traditionally being first-line agents. Some patients may develop dependency on antibiotics, thus requiring long-term maintenance therapy. In a subset of patients, the disease course may be refractory to antibiotic therapy, which is one of the common causes of pouch failure, requiring permanent ileostomy or pouch excision. On the other hand, long-term antibiotic use is expensive and can be associated with adverse effects and bacterial resistance. There may also be the risk of secondary infections, such as Clostridium difficile and fungal infections. The risks and benefits should be carefully balanced in patients who require long-term antibiotic therapy, and safe, efficacious, non-antibiotic-based agents are needed.
