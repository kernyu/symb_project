Several commercial products commonly used for disinfection against feline calicivirus (FCV) have been validated using the vaccine strain F9. However, little information is available regarding the resistance of field strains of FCV to chemical inactivation. In this study, disinfection experiments were performed either on two laboratory-adapted strains or on seven field isolates using three alcohol mixtures and one containing a chlorine compound. For each biocide tested, considerable variability was found among the strains in their susceptibility to inactivation, demonstrating that the effectiveness of disinfection depends not only on the type of chemical compound and exposure time, but also on the FCV strain.
