We report a case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis treated by vancomycin and cotrimoxazole switched to oral linezolid alone with a complete resolution of the vegetation. Two months after discontinuation of treatment, the patient presented a relapse confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis involving the same linezolid-susceptible strain and rapidly died.
