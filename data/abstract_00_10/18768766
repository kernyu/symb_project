Studies of cultured cells have indicated that the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) mediates the development of insulin resistance. Because a role for mTORC1 in the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance has not been established, we studied mTORC1 activity in skeletal muscles of ob/ob (OB) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. In vivo insulin action was assessed in muscles of mice 15 min following an intraperitoneal injection of insulin or an equivalent volume of saline. In the basal state, the phosphorylation of S6K on Thr(389), mTOR on Ser(2448), and PRAS40 on Thr(246) were increased significantly in muscles from OB mice compared with WT mice. The increase in basal mTORC1 signaling was associated with an increase in basal PKB phosphorylation on Thr(308) and Ser(473). In the insulin-stimulated state, no differences existed in the phosphorylation of S6K on Thr(389), but PKB phosphorylation on Thr(308) and Ser(473) was significantly reduced in muscles of OB compared with WT mice. Despite elevated mTORC1 activity in OB mice, rapamycin treatment did not improve either glucose tolerance or insulin tolerance. These results indicate that the insulin resistance of OB mice is mediated, in part, by factors other than mTORC1.
