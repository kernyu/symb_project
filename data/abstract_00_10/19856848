The aim of the study was to determine the aminoglycosides resistance of Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from urocultures. Identification of the germs was performed by the API system (BioMerieux) and susceptibility tests was performed by disk-diffusion test (CLSI standards) and with API strips. For detecting the resistance to aminoglycosides we used gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin and amikacin. From 2500 urine samples we isolated 673 microbial strains, from which 531 were Enterobacteriaceae, especially E. coli, 57.62% and Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumoniae, 27.68% strains. We observed natural maintained sensibility to aminoglycosides at 55.17% from all the strains we have studied The high prevalence of aminoglycosides resistance of Enterobacteriaceae strains is explained by prolonged antibiotic therapy of patients with invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. A rational policy in prescribing antibiotics in this department is therefore mandatory.
