Rosacea affects many individuals and is commonly treated with long-term antibiotics, which are associated with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Recently, subantimicrobial dose doxycycline 20 mg twice a day (SDD) has been used to treat rosacea because of its anti-inflammatory properties. Results of clinical studies support the benefits of SDD, its efficacy in rosacea and acne vulgaris, and even its potential use to prevent atherosclerosis.
