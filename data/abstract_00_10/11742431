PURPOSE: To relate baseline plasma HIV genotypic and virtual phenotypic antiretroviral drug susceptibility to subsequent virological response in patients receiving saquinavir (SQV)-enhancing therapy. Individuals were randomized to receive stavudine (d4T), SQV, and one of ritonavir, nelfinavir, or delavirdine to enhance SQV blood levels. METHOD: The protease and reverse transcriptase baseline sequences of 31 treatment-experienced patients were analyzed by genotype and virtual phenotype and were related to viral load at weeks 12 and 24. Genotypic resistance to SQV was defined by the presence of G48V and/or L90M mutations in the protease gene. Potential cross-resistance to d4T in zidovudine (ZDV)-experienced individuals was defined by the presence of thymidine-associated mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene. RESULTS: ZDV-associated mutations did not affect the virological response at 24 weeks. Individuals who were sensitive to SQV at baseline as determined by either genotyping or virtual phenotyping showed a greater decrease in viral load at week 24 than those resistant to SQV, irrespective of treatment arm. By genotyping, SQV-sensitive individuals had a median log decrease of 1.12 compared to 0.32 for those individuals who were SQV resistant. By virtual phenotyping, SQV-sensitive individuals had a median log decrease of 1.0 compared to a rise of 0.08 in resistant individuals. CONCLUSION: Thymidine analogue-associated mutations at baseline did not influence the response to subsequent therapy involving d4T. Individuals who were sensitive or resistant to SQV by genotyping or virtual phenotyping responded to SQV-enhancing regimens, but the virological response was greater in those who were sensitive.
