Nosocomial infections after spinal surgery are relatively uncommon but potentially serious. The goal of diagnostic evaluation is to determine the extent of infection and identify the microorganism involved. Neuroimaging provides accurate information on correct topography, localization and propagation of the infection. Microbiological data are able to give aetiological causes. In this patient with severe, chronic polymicrobial spine infection with epidural abscess and CSF fistula due to multidrug-resistant organisms, the cure was achieved with long-term antimicrobial specific therapy with quinupristin-dalfopristin (50 days) and linezolid (100 days) with mild side effects. This positive result was due to combined medical and surgical treatment.
