The antimicrobial activity of amoxicillin against TEM-1-expressing strains could be fully recovered when bacteria were preincubated with sublethal doses of an antibacterial peptide derivative. Assays with the simultaneous administration of antibiotics or synergy assays with kanamycin or ciprofloxacin, where resistance development does not involve properly folded proteins, failed to yield similar results.
