The true prevalence rates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRT) are unknown for most regions of Russia. This study was conducted in the Samara Region that differs from other regions in the rapid spread of HIV infection. The purpose of this study was to determine the primary and acquired resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) to first-line antituberculous drugs in patients from civil and penitentiary sectors and to reveal risk factors of drug resistance of MBT. Six hundred patients (309 civilians and 291 prisoners who had been bacteriologically diagnosed as having tuberculosis. The authors have established the following:--in new cases, primary drug resistance is as follows: to isoniazid [38.9% (95% CI, 31.3-36.9%)], to rifampicin [25.9% (95% CI, 19.4-33.4%)] and to MDRT [23.0% (95% CI, 16.7-30.3%)];--in prisoners, the primary resistance of MBT was statistically more significant than in civilians;--male sex, in adequate prior or current treatment for tuberculosis for more than 4 weeks, the presence of fibrocavernous tuberculosis and previous prison stay are essential risk factors of the development of resistance of MBT to both any first-line drug and MDRT;--HIV infection is unassociated with resistance.
