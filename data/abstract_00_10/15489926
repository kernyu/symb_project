OBJECTIVE: To clone Aspergillus fumigatus squalene epoxidase gene and to further investigate its role in terbinafine resistance. METHODS: The A.fumigatus genomic DNA library was transformed into pyrG-A. fumigatus strain protoplasts with polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation protocol. TRB-resistant pyrG+ transformants were then isolated by being plated on MM-U with TRB (0.625 mg/L) plates. After confirmation of terbinafine-resistance by using both disk diffusion and NCCLS M38-A microdilution antifungal susceptibility testing, the gene conferring terbinafine-resistance was identified. Finally, the gene was cloned and retransformed into pyrG-A. fumigatus strain. RESULTS: From a total of 5x10(4) transformants, one TRB-resistant pyrG+ transformant was isolated, which showed the terbinafine-specific resistance without cross-resistance to any other antifungals. A. fumigatus squalene epoxidase gene was further identified to confer this terbinafine-resistance. As a result, the complete A. fumigatus squalene epoxidase gene was firstly cloned. Finally, the transformants with extra copies of A. fumigatus squalene epoxidase gene, again, showed the specific resistance to terbinafine. CONCLUSION: Extra copies of A. fumigatus squalene epoxidase gene, which was cloned for the first time in this study, could result in A. fumigatus resistance to terbinafine. This is a novel mechanism of terbinafine-resistance that needs further investigation for its clinical significance.
