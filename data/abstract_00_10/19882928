PURPOSE: To compare the affect upon bacterial flora found in the conjunctival sacs and the microbial sensitivity of a gatifloxacin (GFLX) ophthalmic solution prospectively with two instillation method groups. METHODS: In one group (group A) GFLX solution was instilled postoperatively eight times/day for 2 days and subsequently four times/day for 12 days. In the other group (group B) the solution was instilled four times/day for 28 days. We investigated bacterial flora in the conjunctival sacs of patients who were to undergo cataract surgery, and tested for microbial sensitivity. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the detection rate of bacterial flora in the conjunctival sacs. One bacterial isolate resistant to LVFX was identified in group A, and one resistant to GFLX and LVFX in group B. CONCLUSION: There is a possibility that the application of topical antibiotics may have little influence on positive culture. However, the occurrence of a resistance to GFLX indicates that the aimless use of antibiotics should be avoided during ophthalmic perioperative periods.
