This is part of the series of practice guidelines commissioned by the Brazilian Society for Infectious Diseases through its Practice Guidelines Committee. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide assistance to clinicians in the antimicrobial treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in immunocompetent adults. Panel members and consultants are experts in adult infectious diseases. The guidelines are evidence based where possible. The recommendations included in this document were elaborated based on the most frequently isolated pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities. The etiology was based mainly on international studies, since there are very few regional data. On the other hand, the antimicrobial susceptibilities of main bacterial causes of CAP were based on the results of several antimicrobial resistance surveillance studies recently performed in Brazil. Other reference guidelines for the treatment of CAP, such as those elaborated by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and by the Canadian Infectious Diseases Society, were also discussed by the group during the elaboration of this document.
