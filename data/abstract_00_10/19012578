The NADH-dependent Enoyl-ACP reductase (InhA) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been shown to be the primary target of the frontline drug isoniazid (INH). However, INH must be first activated by katG gene, mutations in which have mediated resistance to INH. Recently, direct inhibitors of InhA have been reported. Using a structure-based approach, we have identified a tripeptide inhibitor with the sequence WYW, which is 100 times more potent than the existing inhibitors. It is therefore, a potential lead compound for the development of new anti-TB drugs.
