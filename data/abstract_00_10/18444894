Tuberculosis remains the most common cause of death due to a single infective organism. Despite the availability of a vaccine and chemotherapeutic options, the global disease burden remains relatively unaffected. The ability of the mycobacterial etiological agents to adopt a semidormant, phenotypically drug-resistant state requires that chemotherapy is both complex and lengthy. The emergence of drug resistance has raised the possibility of virtually untreatable tuberculosis. Furthermore, the currently used bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine has had mixed success in protecting susceptible populations. Given this backdrop, the need for novel anti-infectives and more effective vaccines is clearly evident. Recent progress, described herein, has seen the development and entry into clinical trials of several new drugs and vaccine candidates.
