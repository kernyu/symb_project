Long term therapy can lead to metabolic complications. Resource poor countries are dealing with difficult issues such as mother to child prevention of HIV transmission. Other treatment options are now available, with the recent introduction of fusion inhibitors, second generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors to clinical practice.
