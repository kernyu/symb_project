We report a case of a life-threatening, recurrent, and azole-resistant pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in a patient receiving long-term fluconazole therapy for a history of coccidioidal meningitis. Since this diagnosis, the patient has received weekly amphotericin B for more than four years and remains in remission with a stable serum Coccidioides complement fixation antibody titer.
