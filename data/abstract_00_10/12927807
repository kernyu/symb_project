The amount of the subunit proteins of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was quantified by the immunoblotting method. A single cell of the wild-type strain contained about 2500, 1000, and 1200 copies of MexA, MexB, and OprM, respectively, and their stoichiometry therefore was 2:1:1. The mexR mutant produced an eightfold higher level of these proteins than did wild-type cells. Assuming that MexB and OprM exist as a trimer in a pump assembly, the total number of MexAB-OprM per wild-type cell was calculated to be about 400 assemblies. The substrate efflux rate of MexAB-OprM was calculated from the fluorescent intensity of ethidium in intact cells that a single cell extruded ethidium at a maximum of about 3 x 10(-19) mol s(-1) and, therefore, the turnover rate of a single pump unit was predicted to be about 500 s(-1).
