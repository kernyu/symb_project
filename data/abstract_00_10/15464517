Systemic infection with Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic disease that affects mainly immunocompromised hosts and is associated with a high mortality rate. We report a case of A. fumigatus endocarditis after an episode of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Diagnosis was established after sudden rupture of posterior papillary muscle of the normal native mitral valve. Soon after mitral valve replacement, Aspergillus endocarditis recurred, associated with multiple peripheral emboli, which necessitated a second operation.
