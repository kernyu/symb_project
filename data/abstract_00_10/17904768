During 6 years, 2000 to 2006, we looked for evolution of antimicrobial resistance to beta-lactams of clinical isolates from patients with Gram negative infections. In vitro susceptibilities to piperacillin+tazobactam, ceftazidime, and aztreonam were followed along the period. Enterobacteriaceae of group 1 to 3 represent 24,884 strains and Pseudomonas spp. 11601. The global sensitivity of aztreonam was 85%, 87.1% for ceftazidime and 88.8% for pieracilline-tazobactam. Of course, aztreonam spectrum of activity is dedicated to Gram negative bacteria only but it is known to have a great penetration ratio in tissues and a half-live observed up to 6 times higher than in serum in experimental models. Antimicrobial rotation strategy is recommended in the prudent use of antibiotics. It seems that in our hospital a consistent increase of the use of aztreonam might be possible and proposed without increasing risk for infection control practices according to the microbiological laboratory results.
