The distribution of subclasses mefA and mefE of the mefA gene among 116 M-phenotype streptococci was as follows: pneumococci (38 strains had mefE and 4 mefA), viridans streptococci (49 mefE and 1 mefA), and Streptococcus pyogenes (24 mefA). Spain(9V)-3-14 and England(14)-9 clones of serotype 14 were dominant among pneumococci.
