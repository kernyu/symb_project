CASE REPORT: A 24-year-old woman suffering from post-influenza otitis media infection was initially treated with several series of a steroid (Elocon) and a combination of steroids and antibiotics (Atecortin, Dicortineff) without significant medical benefit. The isolated bacterial strains were identified as Staphylococcus homis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Specific phage therapy applied sequentially over a period of three weeks resulted only in a partial reduction in inflammation and limited improvement in overall health condition. Oral application of lactoferrin (LF; 50-mg daily oral doses for seven days with two-week intervals) led to a complete clearance of both bacterial strains and full recovery of the patient. The recovery was associated with increased myelopoiesis and a sustained elevation of serum endogenous LF. In conclusion, specific bacteriophage therapy combined with the administration of lactoferrin proved to be effective in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant external ear infection.
