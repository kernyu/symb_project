OBJECTIVES: The aim was to evaluate the incidence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection in Greenland, to assess the value of the test "Helicobacter antigen in faeces" as a diagnostic tool and to determine the level of antibiotic resistance. STUDY DESIGN: 100 consecutive patients with dyspepsia who visited for endoscopic gastric examination were included. The patients had to be born in Greenland and to be > or = 18 years old. METHODS: Samples for HP antibody in blood, HP antigen in faeces, urease test on biopsies were collected from the patients. Gastric biopsies were cultured for HP bacteria, and antibiotic resistance was tested. Patients with positive urease test and/or antigen in faeces and/or positive culture were treated simultaneously with Amoxicillin, Metronidazole and Esomeprazole for 1 week. Patients with duodenal or gastric ulcer were endoscopically re-examined 8 weeks later. Patients with proven HP infection but without ulcer submitted a faeces sample 8 weeks after the eradication. RESULTS: 77 patients were considered HP infected, and received treatment. Only 32% of them were eradicated sufficiently. CONCLUSION: HP antigen in faeces test is useful as a diagnostic tool and for control of therapy. A change in strategy of HP treatment in Greenland is a must, presumably preceded by an elucidation of microbial sensitivity.
