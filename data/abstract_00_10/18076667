Among 200 isolates of Shigella from patients with travellers' diarrhoea, 12 isolates (four isolated in 1995-2000 and eight in 2001-2004) exhibited quinolone resistance. Nine of these isolates originated from India. These resistant isolates had at least one amino-acid substitution in GyrA. Quinolone resistance is increasing in Shigella spp. causing travellers' diarrhoea, and particularly among isolates causing diarrhoea in travellers returning from India.
