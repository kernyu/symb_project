Primary or transmitted antiretroviral drug resistance mutations pose a significant obstacle for optimizing antiviral treatment. When present at low-levels, resistance mutations are less likely to be detected by standard genotyping assays. This study utilizes a novel rolling circle amplification (RCA) method using padlock probes to achieve the sensitive, specific and low-level detection of the NNRTI resistance K103N from 59 HIV+ treatment-naive patients from Beijing, China. Using standard genotyping methods, primary drug resistance mutations to either protease or RT inhibitors were found in 25% (15/59) of patients attending hospital clinics in Beijing. Among these 15 patients with antiretroviral (ARV) resistance mutations, standard sequence-based genotyping revealed that most (10/15) had the 103N. Using a highly sensitive RCA assay, 5 more patients among the 59 treatment-naive cohort were found to have the 103N, but at low-levels, leading to an overall rate of 103N at 25.4% (15/59) in this population. The high prevalence of the 103N suggests that baseline resistance testing should be performed before treatment in this population. Importantly, the new RCA technology allows large-scale, sensitive detection of drug resistance mutations, including detection of minority populations with minimal equipment requirement.
