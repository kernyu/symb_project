This study evaluated the immune-potentiating effect of administrating bovine Lactoferrin (LF) to immunocompetent (IC) and immunosuppressed (IS) mice prior to infection with tachyzoites of T. gondii RH strain. Mice were IS with cyclophosphamide. LF was given in seven of them as oral doses on alternate days. Immunological and parasitological assessments showed that LF induced statistical significance comparable resistance against acute toxoplasmosis in IC and IS mice. This was verified by elevated splenic CD4+ T lymphocytes, reduced tachyzoites' viability and infectivity, with diminished parasite burdens. So, mice mortality declined and their survival was prolonged. This indicated that LF have prophylactic efficacy against human toxoplasmosis in risky persons with alleviating immune balance.
