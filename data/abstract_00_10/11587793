Antimicrobial host defense peptides, such as defensins, protegrins, and platelet microbicidal proteins are deployed by mammalian skin, epithelia, phagocytes, and platelets in response to Staphylococcus aureus infection. In addition, staphylococcal products with similar structures and activities, called bacteriocins, inhibit competing microorganisms. Staphylococci have developed resistance mechanisms, which are either highly specific for certain host defense peptides or bacteriocins or which broadly protect against a range of cationic antimicrobial peptides. Experimental infection models can be used to study the molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial peptides, the peptide resistance strategies of S. aureus, and the therapeutic potential of peptides in staphylococcal diseases.
