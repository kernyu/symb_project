Cells of Mycobacterium avium strain A5 adhered to plasticized polyvinyl chloride catheter tubing and grew at low nutrient concentration, consistent with reports of catheter-associated M. avium infection. Starting with initial cell densities of 1-2x10(6) c.f.u. ml-1, biofilms of approximately 350 c.f.u. cm-2 formed within 24 h at room temperature. Growth rates of cells in biofilms were exponential and equal to 2.45 days doubling time. Rates were exponential for 1-2 weeks incubation and reached cell densities of 6.5x10(4) c.f.u. cm-2 by 4 weeks. Cells grown in catheter biofilms were significantly more resistant to clarithromycin and rifamycin than cells grown in suspension.
