We developed an efficacious and non-irritant mouthwash that is alcohol-free and that has a low concentration of chlorhexidine, in order to be used for preventing oral cavity infections in immunocompromised and cancer patients. The novel mouthwash solution was tested for its antimicrobial efficacy against both free floating (planktonic) and the biofilm forms of Candida albicans. The solution was also tested against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), using a modification of a previously published method. The activity of the novel mouthwash was also compared with that of three commercially available mouthwashes. The experimental mouthwash showed efficacy against C. albicans, both in free-floating form and in biofilm. With higher concentration of chlorhexidine, the solution was also efficacious in inhibiting the growth of K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and MRSA. The antiseptic activity of the alcohol-free mouthwash against other bacterial organisms and C. albicans was comparable to other commercially available alcohol-based mouthwash solutions. A novel alcohol-free mouthwash solution, that has low concentration of chlorhexidine, showed antiseptic effect against planktonic and biofilm forms of C. albicans and against K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and MRSA.
