This study evaluated resistance to sanitizing solutions of Escherichia coli O157:H7 cells forming biofilms on stainless steel coupons exposed to inoculated meat decontamination runoff fluids (washings). A previously acid-adapted culture of a rifampicin-resistant derivative of E. coli O157:H7 strain ATCC 43895 was inoculated in unsterilized or sterilized combined hot-water (85 degrees C) and cold-water (10 degrees C) (50/50 [vol/vol]) composite water (W) washings (pH 6.29 to 6.47) and in W washings mixed with 2% acetic acid (pH 4.60 to 4.71) or in 2% lactic acid W washings (pH 4.33 to 4.48) at a ratio of 1/99 (vol/vol). Stainless steel coupons (2 by 5 by 0.08 cm) were submerged in the inoculated washings and stored for up to 14 days at 15 degrees C. Survival of E. coli O157:H7 was determined after exposure (0 to 60 s for cells in suspension and 0 to 300 s for attached cells) to two commercial sanitizers (150 ppm peroxyacetic acid and 200 ppm quaternary ammonium compound) at 2, 7, and 14 days. E. coli O157:H7 attached more rapidly to coupons submerged in washings containing the natural flora than to those without. The attached cells were more resistant to the effects of the sanitizers than were the cells in suspension, and survival was highest in the presence of the natural flora. Attached cells in the presence of dilute acid washings were more sensitive to subsequent sanitizer treatments than were cells generated in the presence of W washings. Under the conditions of this study, cells of E. coli O157:H7 in W washings were more sensitive to acidic (peroxyacetic acid) than to alkaline (quaternary ammonium) sanitizers during storage. These results suggest that meat processing plants that apply no decontamination or that use only water washings of meat should consider using acidic sanitizers to enhance biofilm removal. Plants that apply both water and acidic washings may create a sublethal acid-stressing environment in the runoff fluids, sensitizing biofilm cells to subsequent sanitizing treatments.
