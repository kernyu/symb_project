Hydrogen-bonded multilayers comprised of polyacrylamide (PAAm) and a weak polyelectrolyte, such as poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) or poly(methacrylic acid) (PMA), were investigated for their surface-cell interactions. The assembled films were lightly cross-linked thermally or photochemically in order to render them stable in a physiological environment. Both PAA/PAAm and PMA/PAAm multilayers were found to exhibit a high resistance to the adhesion (cytophobicity) of mammalian fibroblasts, even with only a single bilayer coating. Protein adsorption to the multilayers, as revealed by surface plasmon resonance measurements, was greatly reduced for fibronectin and serum-containing medium. In situ swelling experiments indicate that the H-bonded multilayers are hydrogellike coatings capable of a high level of swelling in buffered solution. Utilizing the H-bonding nature of these multilayers, we were able to micropattern the films to create more complex cell-resistant/-adhesive surfaces. The long-term stability of the cell-resistant multilayers was found to be exceptionally good even under conditions (pH 7.4, buffered solution) where a high degree of swelling takes place. No degradation of the micropatterned films was observed over a period of a month, during which time the multilayer coatings remained highly resistant to cell-adhesion.
