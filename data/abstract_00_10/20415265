Retrospective analysis provided data on the efficacy and safety of antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of urinary tract infections in 21 patients with urolithiasis in an urological unit of a municipal multiprofile hospital. For estimation of the antimicrobial therapy efficacy ATC/DDD method was used (The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System with Defined Daily Doses). The analysis showed that the isolates (> 50%) were highly resistant to the majority of the antibiotics prescribed by the physicians for the empirical therapy within 90% DU (Drug Utilization). Moreover, adverse reactions to the antibiotics were recorded in 9.5% of the patients. It was concluded that in the routine practice of the physicians, the antibiotic therapy was not corrected with the microbiological view and the pharmacotherapy efficacy was not duely estimated. Such a situation requires cooperation of clinical pharmacologists and clinicians, periodical analysis of the drug misuse and therapeutic drug monitoring to solve the problem.
