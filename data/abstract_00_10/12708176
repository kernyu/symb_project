676 E. faecalis strains were listed over a period of 2 years from the Charles Nicolle hospital of Tunis (167 strains), the Habib Bourguiba hospital of Sfax (350 strains) and the National Centre of Bone marrow Transplantation of Tunis (159 strains). Antibiotic sensibility study was realized by the method of the antibiogram, E-test method and the search of penicillinase by cefinase. E. faecalis resulted essentially from services of onco-haematology (24%), external consultations (23%), surgery (18%) and medicine (15%). These strains were isolated especially from urines (54%), coprocultures (15%), bloodcultures (11%) and from pus (9%). Resistance acquired with these strains is raised for erythromycin, tetracyclin and chloramphenicol (81% to 86%), followed by high level resistance to gentamicine (37%). 0.1% of E. faecalis strains have a low level resistance to amoxicillin without production of penicillinase. No resistance to vancomycin was observed.
