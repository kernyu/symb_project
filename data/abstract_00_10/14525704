INTRODUCTION: In this study we characterize a trimethoprim-resistant strain of Shigella flexneri recovered from stool samples of an international traveler after a trip to Kenya, and analyze its epidemiological relationship with a set of strains having similar characteristics from Tanzania. METHODS: Clonal relationships were studied by three techniques - plasmid profile, repetitive-element (REP)-PCR and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The presence of type 1 integrons was studied by PCR and sequencing. The location and transferability of the detected integron was analyzed by conjugation and PCR. RESULTS: The epidemiological studies showed that all six strains studied belonged to the same clone. Furthermore, all of them carried the same gene encoding for trimethoprim resistance (dfrA7), which was located in an integron within a chromosome. CONCLUSION: Continuous epidemiological surveillance is required to control the spread of pathogenic microorganisms and the dissemination of resistance-encoding genes among geographical areas.
