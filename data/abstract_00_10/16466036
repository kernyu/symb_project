OBJECTIVE: To assess the combined effects of drug resistance, HIV infection and treatment regimen on treatment outcomes of smear-positive tuberculosis patients in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. METHODS: A representative sample of patients diagnosed in 1998-2000 in 12 urban districts was offered HIV testing and submitted sputum for Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture and drug susceptibility testing. New patients were treated with 2SHRZ/6HE in nine districts and with 2SHRZ/4RH in three districts. RESULTS: The cure rate was 87% (1240/1430) among new patients compared to only 73% (287/391) among previously treated patients. Failure was associated with multidrug resistance (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] 49.6 and 16.6, respectively) and combined resistance to isoniazid (INH) and streptomycin (SM) (aOR 13.4 and 4.8), but not with HIV infection. New patients had an increased risk of failure on treatment with 2SHRZ/4RH compared to 2SHRZ/6HE if the isolate was resistant to INH and SM (aOR 2.8, P = 0.016). Death during treatment occurred in 15 of 50 HIV-infected patients (30%). Mortality was significantly associated with HIV infection (aOR 29.9), multidrug resistance (aOR 4.7) and other resistance to two or more drugs (aOR 2.1). CONCLUSION: In Vietnam, adaptation of treatment regimens should be considered, and interventions are needed to reduce the high mortality among HIV-infected patients.
