The appearance and dissemination of vancomycin resistance among clinically important Gram-positive bacteria was an important watershed in antimicrobial resistance trends that drastically narrows therapeutic options, particularly among the enterococci. Clinical resistance despite apparent susceptibility has also become an increasingly recognized issue with vancomycin treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and endocarditis, which may be, in part, due to vancomycin-heteroresistant strains. The newly developed glycopeptides telavancin, dalbavancin and oritavancin have superior in vitro activity, enhanced bactericidality and unique pharmacokinetic properties compared with vancomycin and teicoplanin. Current clinical trial data show noninferiority to vancomycin or standard-of-care antistaphylococcal therapy for complicated skin-skin structure infections, and acceptable safety profiles. Although promising, whether or not these new compounds are clinically efficacious for the true therapeutic deficits created by in vitro and clinical vancomycin resistance is yet to be determined.
