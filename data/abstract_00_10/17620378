Azoles are extensively applied in agriculture and medicine, and a relationship between the development of azole resistance in agriculture and the development of azole resistance in clinical practice may exist. The maize pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola, causing cutaneous mycosis and keratitis, has been used to investigate the acquisition of resistance to an agricultural azole and the resulting cross-resistance to various medical antifungal agents. Azole-adapted strains were less sensitive to all azoles tested but showed increased sensitivity to caspofungin, amphotericin B, and nystatin. Viability staining and infection assays with excised human skin confirmed these data.
