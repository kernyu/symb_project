Nosocomial or hospital-acquired infections are associated with prolonged hospitalizations and increased healthcare costs. Infections associated with surgical implants are becoming more difficult and more costly to manage, as they require repeated surgical procedures and a longer period of time to treat patients. Continued advances in the use of medical devices, an increase in the number of immunocompromised patients, and a steady rise in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms has renewed interest in the development of novel therapies that can be used to prevent and treat nosocomial infections. This review provides an overview of bacterial adhesins and focuses on novel immunological therapies developed to treat staphylococcal infections.
