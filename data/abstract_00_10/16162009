Changes in the GSH/GST system have been found to correlate with resistance to anticancer alkylating agents, presumably through accelerated detoxification of these drugs since some GSTs have been shown to catalyze the conjugation of GSH to specific antineoplastic agents. GSH-alkyl derivatives were designed by molecular modeling, synthesized, and tested as inhibitors of human GST-Pi.
