DNA damage associated with the trypanocidal activity of megazol [2-amino-5-(1-methyl-5-nitro-2-imidazolyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole] was shown in experiments in which DNA repair-deficient RAD51(-/-) Trypanosoma brucei mutants were found to be hypersensitive to the drug. Parasites resistant to megazol were selected and showed modest cross-resistance to other trypanocides, although neither drug efflux nor changes to intracellular thiols correlated with resistance.
