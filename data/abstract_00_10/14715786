Antibiotic susceptibility testing of 70 pediatric Helicobacter pylori isolates was performed by using screening agar and disk diffusion methods. Resistance to metronidazole and tinidazole was 72 to 79% and 71 to 81% by modified disk diffusion and 77% and 78% by screening agar, respectively. Susceptibilities to amoxicillin, ampicillin, clarithromycin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin were 58, 69, 75, 68, 68, and 65%, respectively.
