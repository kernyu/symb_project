The aim of this study was to test whether silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) released into estuarine environments result in increased antibiotic resistance amongst the natural bacterial population in estuarine sediments. A 50-day microcosm exposure experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of Ag-NPs (50 nm average diameter) on the antibiotic resistance of bacteria in sediments from an estuary in southwest England. Experimental microcosms were constructed using 3.5 kg sediment cores with 20 l of overlaying seawater treated with (final) Ag-NPs concentrations of 0, 50 or 2000 microg l(-1) (n=3). Sediment samples were screened at the end of the exposure period for the presence of bacteria resistant to eight different antibiotics. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that there was no increase in antibiotic resistance amongst the bacterial population in the sediment due to the dosing of the microcosms with Ag-NPs. This study indicates that, under the tested conditions, Ag-NPs released into the coastal marine environment do not increase antibiotic resistance among naturally occurring bacteria in estuarine sediments. These results contrast previous findings where antimicrobial effects of Ag-NPs on key bacterial species in laboratory experiments have been demonstrated, and reasons for this are discussed. The negligible effects demonstrated on bacterial populations under the selected estuarine conditions, provide important information on no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) for environmental regulation.
