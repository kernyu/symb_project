The bacterial Zn2+ metallo-beta-lactamase from B. fragilis is a zinc-enzyme with two potential metal ion binding sites. It cleaves the lactam ring of antibiotics, thus contributing to the acquired resistance of bacteria against antibiotics. The present study bears on the binuclear form of the enzyme. We compare several possible binding modes of captopril, a mercaptocarboxamide inhibitor of several zinc-metalloenzymes. Two diastereoisomers of captopril were considered, with either a D- or an L-proline residue. We have used the polarizable molecular mechanics procedure SIBFA (Sum of Interactions Between Fragments ab initio computed). Two beta-lactamase models were considered, encompassing 104 and 188 residues, respectively. The energy balances included the inter and intramolecular interaction energies as well as the contribution from solvation computed using a continuum reaction field procedure. The thiolate ion of the inhibitor is binding to both metal ions, expelling the bridging solvent molecule from the uncomplexed enzyme. Different competing binding modes of captopril were considered, either where the inhibitor binds in a monodentate mode to the zinc cations only with its thiolate ion, or in bidentate modes involving additional zinc binding by its carboxylate or ketone carbonyl groups. The additional coordination by the inhibitor's carboxylate or carbonyl group always occurs at the zinc ion, which is bound by a histidine, a cysteine, and an aspartate side chain. For both diastereomers, the energy balances favor monodentate binding of captopril via S-. The preference over bidentate binding is small. The interaction energies were recomputed in model sites restricted to captopril, the Zn2+ cations, and their coordinating end side chains from beta-lactamase (98 atoms). The interaction energies and their ranking among competing arrangements were consistent with those computed by ab initio HF and DFT procedures.
