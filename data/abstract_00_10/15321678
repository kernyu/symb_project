A dry bubble is an undifferentiated structure that forms in place of mushrooms when cultures of Agaricus bisporus are contaminated by Verticillium fungicola. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations were measured in lyophilised samples of bubbles and healthy sporocarps from cultures of genetically related strains of A. bisporus. The strains the more resistant to the pathogen had the higher levels of H2O2 concentration measured in the bubbles, but the differences in the healthy sporocarps were not significant. That is an indication of a higher reaction to the pathogen in the forming sporocarps of A. bisporus strains associated with their partial resistance to V. fungicola.
