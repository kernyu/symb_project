OBJECTIVE: This manuscript attempts to provide insight into current concepts of prevention, diagnosis, and management of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). DATA SOURCES: A Medline search from 1996 to May 2004 was performed. Search terms included: ventilator-associated pneumonia with prevention, diagnosis, management, duration, resistance, and outcome. DATA SELECTION: Emphasis was placed on the recent peer-reviewed literature. Human data were preferentially included. DATA EXTRACTION: Where possible, recent publications (within the last year) were used in preference to older data. The references were chosen to present key citations. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data selection was prioritized to address specific subtopics. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment and prevention of VAP is evolving rapidly based on improved diagnostic skills and a better understanding of optimal antimicrobial therapy. An overview of new and key data guiding clinicians in the management of this important disease is presented.
