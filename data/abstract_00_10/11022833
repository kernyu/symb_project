BACKGROUND: The aim of the present paper was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of a 1-week treatment regimen consisting of pantoprazole and two antibiotics: clarithromycin and amoxycillin, in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. METHODS: The patients selected had unequivocal evidence of H. pylori infection based on urease test, culture and histology on antral and corpus biopsies obtained at endoscopy. Patients received pantoprazole 40 mg twice a day, clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day and amoxycillin 1 g twice a day for 1 week and were assessed for successful eradication at least 4 weeks after completion of therapy by repeat gastroscopy and gastric biopsies. Eradication was defined as absence of bacteria in both antral and corpus biopsies tested by culture, histology and urease test. RESULTS: One hundred and six patients were recruited for the study. The mean age was 48.0 years (range: 23-74 years). Four patients defaulted follow up and five patients were not compliant (taking less than 85%) with medications. Eradication rates on per-protocol analysis were: 88/97 (90.7%; 95% CI: 83.1-95.7); and on intention-to-treat analysis they were: 88/106 (83.0%; 95% CI: 75.9-90.2). Side-effects were in general mild and tolerable: 57 of 106 (53.7%) patients complained of a bitter taste; 15 (14.1%) complained of giddiness; 10 (9.4%) complained of increased abdominal pain; 11 (11.5%) complained of lethargy and 16 (15.1%) complained of loose motions. Pre-treatment metronidazole resistance was encountered in 57/74 strains (77.0%). Clarithromycin resistance was not encountered in any of the strains. CONCLUSIONS: The pantoprazole 1-week triple therapy with amoxycillin and clarithromycin is effective in H. pylori eradication. The treatment was well tolerated by patients. Metronidazole resistance was reported in a high percentage of strains isolated from patients. Clarithromycin resistance was, however, not detected in any of the strains.
