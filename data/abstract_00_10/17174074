Tigecycline is a glycylcycline with promising broad-spectrum activity, including resistant Gram-positive organisms. This study characterizes in vitro activity of tigecycline against quinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (QRSP), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). An in vitro pharmacodynamic model generated specific bacterial kill profiles for tigecycline against clinical isolates of QRSP, MRSA and VRE. Tigecycline produced a 6.6 log total reduction and cleared QRSP from the pharmacodynamic model by 18 h. Tigecycline and vancomycin were unable to achieve 3-log reductions in the MRSA and VRE isolates; log reductions in MRSA and VRE were 1.5 and 1.2 logs for tigecycline and 2.8 and zero for vancomycin, respectively. Area under the concentration time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) values for tigecycline ranged from 79 to 158 microg h/mL and tigecycline concentrations remained above the MIC (T>MIC) throughout the simulated dosing interval. Tigecycline showed in vitro activity against the QRSP, MRSA and VRE isolates studied. Low MIC values, prolonged elimination half-life and the associated post-antibiotic effect (PAE) observed with tigecycline are desirable attributes that make it a potentially attractive option for treating resistant Gram-positive organisms.
