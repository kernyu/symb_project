Natural polymorphisms in the pol gene of HIV-2 may influence the susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs and the choice of treatment. We collected samples in centers for anonymous HIV testing in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in patients supposedly naive for any antiretroviral treatment. Eighty-four samples were first tested as HIV-2 positive in Burkina Faso and then shipped to Brussels, Belgium, for confirmation of the serological status and plasma viral load. Fifty-two samples were confirmed as HIV-2 positive in Belgium. Twelve others were HIV-1 positive and 20 were dually reactive. Twenty-one of HIV-2 confirmed samples had an HIV-2 plasma viral load higher than 1000 copies/ml. These viruses were sequenced in the protease and reverse trancriptase genes and 17 sequences of the pol gene were obtained. Highly polymorphic positions were identified in protease and RT genes. Two samples harbored known resistance mutations: M184V RT mutation in one and Q151M with M184V in the other. Phylogenetic analysis showed that viruses in Burkina Faso did not cluster separately from published sequences from neighboring countries. The two resistant strains were unrelated. Our findings imply either that resistant viruses are circulating in Burkina Faso or that some individuals take unsupervised treatment. Both hypotheses present problems.
