As part of an ongoing project to identify plant natural products as resistance-modifying agents, bioassay-guided fractionation of an extract of Jatropha elliptica (Pohl) Muell Arg. led to the isolation of a penta-substituted pyridine, namely 2,6-dimethyl-4-phenyl-pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester (8). The structure was established by spectroscopic methods. This known compound was assayed for in vitro antibacterial and resistance-modifying activities against strains of Staphylococcus aureus possessing the MsrA and NorA resistance efflux mechanisms. Antibiotic efflux studies indicated that (8) acts as an inhibitor of the NorA efflux pump and restores the level of intracellular drug concentration.
