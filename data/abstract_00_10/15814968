Recent data indicated that the rate of vancomycin resistance in bloodstream-infecting enterococcal isolates in Italy is one of the highest in Europe. The aims of this study were to characterize bloodstream-infecting vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) obtained from various Italian hospitals and to establish whether the isolates were clonally related. During the years 2001 to 2003, a total of 39 VRE isolates were obtained from 19 hospital laboratories in various areas of Italy. Species identification and resistance genotypes of the isolates were obtained by multiplex PCR. Further characterization included antibiotic susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of SmaI-digested genomic DNA, detection of virulence genes (esp and hyl), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of selected isolates. VRE were identified as 31 Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) isolates and 8 E. faecalis isolates. All but one isolate carried the vanA gene; one VREfm isolate carried the vanB gene. Analysis of the PFGE profiles showed that 28 VREfm isolates shared a similar electrophoretic profile, designed type 1, and were clonally related. All type 1 isolates were resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, and rifampin and were positive for the esp gene. MLST identified an allelic profile (ST78) comprising purK allele 1, belonging to the C1 clonal lineage, characteristic of human infection and hospital outbreak isolates. The vanB-carrying VREfm isolate, of PFGE type 2, was shown to be a single-locus variant of ST78. Our data indicate that the recent increase in the number of bloodstream infections caused by VRE in Italy is due to the spread of a hospital-adapted, multidrug-resistant VREfm clone belonging to an internationally disseminated lineage.
