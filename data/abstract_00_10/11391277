Nosocomial infections and antimicrobial resistance are major causes of mortality and morbidity and have become a major public health focus. To date, most national and international nosocomial infection surveillance and prevention activities have been focused on adults, despite the fact that pediatric patients are at high risk for nosocomial infections because of their immature immune systems and prevalent device usage. In 1997 the Hospital Infections Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions partnered to establish a Pediatric Prevention Network. Infection control professionals and their hospital administrators at all children's hospitals were invited to participate. The objectives of the network are to establish baseline infection rates; design, implement, and evaluate prevention interventions; establish benchmark rates and best practices; and serve as a site for multicenter studies to improve outcomes for hospitalized children. This network serves as a model for quality improvement systems in health care.
