Even though the human parasite Leishmania donovani encounters tremendous oxidative burst during macrophage invasion, a set of parasites survives and proliferates intracellularly, leading to transformation from promastigote to amastigote form and disease manifestation. The striking shifts in temperature (from 22 degrees C in the insect gut to 37 degrees C in the mammalian host) and pH (7.2 in the insect gut to 5.5 in the parasitophorous vacuole of macrophages) are the key environmental triggers for differentiation as these cause an arrest in the G1 stage of the cell cycle and initiate transformation. Using an established in vitro culture and differentiation system our study demonstrates that the differentiation-triggering environment induces resistance to oxidative damage and consequently enhances infectivity. Differentiation conditions caused a three- to fourfold elevation in cAMP level as well as cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Similar to stress exposure, positive modulation of intracellular cAMP resulted in blockage of cell cycle progression and induction of resistance against oxidative damage. Resistance against pro-oxidants from either stress or cAMP may be associated with upregulation of the expression of three major antioxidant genes, peroxidoxin 1, trypanothione reductase, and superoxide dismutase A. Positive modulation of the intracellular cAMP response enables cells to resist the cytotoxic effects of pro-oxidants. In contrast, downregulation of intracellular cAMP by overexpression of cAMP phosphodiesterase A resulted in a decrease in resistance against oxidative damage and reduced infectivity toward activated macrophages. This study for the first time reveals the importance of cAMP response in the life cycle and infectivity of the Leishmania parasite.
