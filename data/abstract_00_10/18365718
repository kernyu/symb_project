A systematic analysis of the inheritance of D plasmids of the IncP-9 group (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, zeta-, eta-, theta-subgroups), IncP-7, as well as of those of undefined systematic affiliation in the cells of homologous (Pseudomonas putida) and heterologous (Escherichia coli) hosts was performed for the first time. For this purpose, mini-Tn5 transposons determining resistance to kanamycin (or streptomycin) were introduced into all the D plasmids under study. It has been established that all IncP-9 plasmids can be transmitted to the cells of a heterologous host E. coli (with the exception of plasmid pSVS15 from theta-subgroup). IncP-7 plasmids and those of undefined systematic affiliation do not possess this property and can be transmitted and stably inherited only in P. putida. The distinctive feature of most IncP-9 plasmids (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, and zeta-subgroups) is strict dependence of their inheritance on the temperature factor. At 37 degrees C, the plasmids of delta-, zeta-, and theta-subgroups are unstable in P. putida cells, while in E. coli nearly all plasmids of this systematic group are unstable. The exceptions are the plasmids of eta- and gamma-subgroups. Inheritance of these plasmids does not depend on temperature. At 28 degrees C and 37 degrees C, the eta plasmid is not maintained stably (inheritance stability is 2%), while the gamma plasmid has almost 100% stability under the same conditions.
