BACKGROUND: A 1400-bed tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan was used to conduct an epidemiological study of children hospitalized with community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infection during a 5-year period. METHODS: Nineteen previously healthy children with predominantly skin and soft-tissue CA-MRSA infections were enrolled into the study. Seventeen CA-MRSA isolates were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular typing. RESULTS: A comparison of our results with the reported resistance rates among CA-MRSA isolates from other countries showed uniformly high macrolide resistance (100%). Of the 17 MRSA isolates in our study, all had the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin-constitutive phenotype and the ermB gene. Moreover, on the basis of molecular typing results, 11 (65%) of 17 CA-MRSA isolates were genetically related (as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis), and multilocus sequence typing revealed a sequence type of 59 in all isolates. Staphylococcal toxin genes lukS-PV and lukF-PV were detected in all isolates. However, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type IV was only detected in 3 (17.6%) of 17 isolates; the remaining 14 isolates were untypeable. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of our data suggests the predominance of a single endemic CA-MRSA strain with high macrolide resistance in our community. Clinical improvement with incision and drainage was noted for most patients, despite treatment with an ineffective antibiotic, so the need for a change in treatment guidelines should be addressed.
