The anti-HIV activity of new membranotropic compounds, i.e. of the polycarboxylate matrix and of its derivatives modified by adamantane and norbonene, was studied in respect of HIV-1 strains, whose tropicity to coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 was different, as well as in respect of HIV-1 variants resistant to azidothymidine (AZT) in a continuous culture of human lymphoid cells (MT-4) and in mononuclear cells of peripheral blood from healthy donors. Testing of complex compounds in a culture of infected MT-4 human lymphoid cells showed an effective inhibition of viral reproduction of LAV.04 (CXCR4-tropic variant) and of HIV11(EVK) as well as AZT-resistant variants. The studied pharmacophores-modified compounds displayed, in infection of the primary culture of human mononuclear cells of the HIV-1 R5 and X4 strains, a notable antiviral activity with their HIV efficiency significantly exceeding the one of the original matrix.
