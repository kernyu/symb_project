The present study aims to investigate whether pazufloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, is a substrate for P-glycoprotein in vitro, and whether it is excreted from kidney by P-glycoprotein and/or multidrug resistance-associated protein (Mrp2) in vivo. The in vitro experiments showed that the intracellular accumulation of pazufloxacin in adriamycin-resistant human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (K562/ADR) overexpressing P-glycoprotein was significantly lower than that in human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (K562/S) not expressing P-glycoprotein. When rats received an intravenous injection of pazufloxacin in combination with or without cyclosporine, cyclosporine significantly delayed the disappearance of pazufloxacin from plasma and decreased the systemic clearance and volume of distribution at steady state of pazufloxacin to 50% and 70% of the corresponding control values, respectively. Renal handling experiments revealed that the renal clearance of pazufloxacin was 75% of that corresponding to the systemic clearance, suggesting that the main route of pazufloxacin elimination is the kidney. Cyclosporine significantly increased the steady-state concentration of pazufloxacin in plasma by decreasing the tubular secretion clearance and glomerular filtration rate. These results suggest the possibility that pazufloxacin is excreted into the urine via P-glycoprotein. No significant differences in the renal and tubular secretion clearances of pazufloxacin were observed between normal rats and Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBR), which have a hereditary deficiency in Mrp2, indicating the lack of the involvement of Mrp2 in the renal excretion of pazufloxacin. Sparfloxacin, a P-glycoprotein substrate, also significantly decreased the renal and tubular secretion clearances of pazufloxacin, suggesting that pazufloxacin and sparfloxacin share the same transporters, including P-glycoprotein. The present study at least suggests that pazufloxacin is excreted into the urine via P-glycoprotein and some active drug transporters other than Mrp2.
