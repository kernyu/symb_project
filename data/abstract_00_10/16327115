Nosocomial acquisition of microorganisms resistant to multiple antibiotics represents a threat to patient safety. Here, we review the antimicrobial resistance in Enterococcus, which makes it important nosocomial pathogen. The emergence of enterococci with acquired resistance to vancomycin has been particularly problematic as it often occurs in enterococci that are also highly resistant to ampicillin and aminoglycoside thereby associated with devastating therapeutic consequences. Multiple factors contribute to colonization and infection with vancomycin resistant enterococci ultimately leading to environmental contamination and cross infection. Decreasing the prevalence of these resistant strains by multiple control efforts therefore, is of paramount importance.
