Gentamicin and tobramycin are two aminoglycosides commonly impregnated into polymethylmethacrylate for treatment and prevention of prosthetic joint infection. Susceptibilities of staphylococci to aminoglycosides are not reported routinely in the United States. The gentamicin and tobramycin minimum inhibitory value of 93 staphylococci from patients with PJI were determined. Forty-one and 66% of the isolates were resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin, respectively. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates were more likely to be resistant to gentamicin or tobramycin than were their methicillin susceptible counterparts. The findings suggest that consideration should be given to the further study of agents other than aminoglycosides for incorporation into polymethylmethacrylate for the treatment and prevention of prosthetic joint infection.
