OBJECTIVES: To investigate the possibilities of an association between the degrees of HBV suppression with nucleoside treatments at week 24 and week 52 in hepatitis B patients and to find a useful predictor for treatment efficacy. METHODS: In this phase III, double-blind, multicenter trial, we compared the efficacy of telbivudine treatment with lamivudine treatment in 332 Chinese compensated chronic hepatitis B patients. The patients were randomly assigned to a daily 600 mg telbivudine treatment group or daily 100 mg lamivudine group for 24 weeks. They were then categorized into 4 groups according to their serum HBV DNA levels (copies/ml) at week 24: a PCR-undetectable group (< 300 copies/ml); a QL- < 10(3) copies/ml group; a 10(3)-<10(4) copies/ml group; and a > or = 10(4) copies/ml group. The treatments were continued as they previously had been for another 28 weeks and the patients serum HBV DNA levels were examined again. RESULTS: At week 52, mean reductions of serum HBV DNA were significantly greater in the telbivudine-treated patients than in the lamivudine-treated group (6.2 log10 vs 5.4 log10, t = 3.6, P < 0.01). Viral resistance was twice as common in lamivudine-treated patients compared to those receiving telbivudine. Telbivudine was well-tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to that of lamivudine. The lower the HBV DNA level achieved at week 24, the higher HBV DNA non-detectable by PCR. ALT normalization and HBeAg seroconversion achieved at week 52, and viral resistance at week 48 decreased parallel to the degree of HBV DNA inhibition. CONCLUSION: HBV DNA PCR-undetectable at week 24 in nucleoside-treated hepatitis B patients suggests a better efficacy at week 52 and lower viral resistance at week 48. The degree of suppression of HBV at week 24 may be used as a predictor of 1-year outcome.
