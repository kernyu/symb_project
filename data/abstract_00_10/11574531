The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 is thought to be required for biosynthesis of the cell's translational apparatus, a critical component of cell growth and proliferation. We have studied the signal transduction pathways involved in hepatic S6 phosphorylation during late gestation in the rat. This is a period during which hepatocytes show a high rate of proliferation that is, at least in part, independent of mitogenic signaling pathways that are operative in mature hepatocytes. Our initial studies demonstrated that there was low basal activity of two S6 kinases in liver, S6K1 and S6K2, on embryonic day 19 (2 days preterm). In addition, insulin- and growth factor-mediated S6K1 and S6K2 activation was markedly attenuated compared with that in adult liver. Nonetheless, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated that fetal liver S6 itself was highly phosphorylated. To characterize the fetal hepatocyte pathway for S6 phosphorylation, we went on to study the sensitivity of hepatocyte proliferation to the S6 kinase inhibitor rapamycin. Unexpectedly, administration of rapamycin to embryonic day 19 fetuses in situ did not affect hepatocyte DNA synthesis. This resistance to the growth inhibitory effect of rapamycin occurred even though S6K1 and S6K2 were inhibited. Furthermore, fetal hepatocyte proliferation was sustained even though rapamycin administration resulted in the dephosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. In contrast, rapamycin blocked hepatic DNA synthesis in adult rats following partial hepatectomy coincident with S6 dephosphorylation. We conclude that hepatocyte proliferation in the late gestation fetus is supported by a rapamycin-resistant mechanism that can function independently of ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation.
