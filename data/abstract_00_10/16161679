Inactivation of Yersinia enterocolitica by chlorine (0.6 to 20 ppm) was investigated in distilled water and in tryptic soy broth (TSB, 0.015%) at different temperatures (4, 20, and 40 degrees C). In distilled water, chlorine inactivation of Y. enterocolitica was enhanced by increasing the temperature from 4 to 20 degrees C, and survival curves were described by a model that assumed first-order kinetics followed by tailing in which the microbial concentration remained constant. The presence of TSB increased chlorine resistance of Y. enterocolitica, and survival curves were concave downward. These survival curves were described by a model based on the Weibull distribution. Chlorine decay in distilled water was independent of temperature and of the initial concentration of available chlorine and was modeled by first-order reaction kinetics. Chlorine decay in TSB was independent of the initial chlorine concentration but depended on the treatment temperature and was modeled by the addition of two first-order decay equations. The increased resistance of Y. enterocolitica to chlorine in TSB was not due only to the chlorine demand by the TSB components. These components protected Y. enterocolitica cells from the antimicrobial effect of chlorine.
