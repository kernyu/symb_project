AIM: This review surveys the different classes of drugs. METHOD: We searched electronic databases and selected articles about pharmacotherapy with anti-retroviral drugs. RESULTS: We discuss anti-retroviral drugs: the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and the protease inhibitors (PIs). The combination of a PI and two NRTIs is very effective and lowers the viral load to below the limit of detection. However, it is not yet possible to eliminate the virus completely. Recently, the first member of a brand new class of drugs has become available, the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide. We also discuss the problems associated with combining anti-retroviral drugs, such as compliance, resistance and serious side effects. DISCUSSION: It is important to investigate new combinations with new classes of drugs, like the fusion inhibitors, for better effectiveness and fewer side effects.
