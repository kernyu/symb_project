UV-inactivated GCHV (grass carp hemorrhage virus) is able to induce an antiviral state in cultured CAB cells (crucian carp Carassius auratus blastulae embryonic cells) via the production of interferon (IFN). In the current work, the full-length cDNAs of two Mx genes, termed CaMx1 and CaMx2, have been cloned and sequenced from UV-inactivated GCHV-infected and still IFN-producing CAB cells by suppression subtractive hybridization. Their putative proteins show the characteristically structural features of mammalian IFN-induced Mx proteins, including GTP-binding motif, dynamin family signature and leucine zipper motif. CaMx1 exhibits 85% sequence identity to zebrafish MxA and 72-74% to three Atlantic salmon Mx proteins. CaMx2 is most similar to zebrafish MxE, with 80% identity, and then rainbow trout Mx3, with 52%. Constitutive expression was detected by RT-PCR for CaMx1, but not for CaMx2, in normal CAB cells, but their up-regulations could be induced after treatment with active GCHV, UV-inactivated GCHV and CAB IFN. Distinct kinetics of expression was observed for either CaMx1 or CaMx2 corresponding to the three stimuli, and even between CaMx1 and CaMx2, corresponding to the same stimulus. Upon virus infection, the transcriptional induction was strongly blocked for CaMx2 by cycloheximide (CHX), whereas almost nothing was observed for CaMx1. By contrast, following treatment with CAB IFN, CHX did not inhibit either gene transcription. Collectively, these results suggest that there are very distinct mechanisms for modulating the expression of both CaMx1 and CaMx2 in normal and GCHV-infected CAB cells.
