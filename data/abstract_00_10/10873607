Human hepatocytes cultured serum-free for up to 6 weeks were used to study expression and induction of enzymes and membrane transport proteins involved in drug metabolism. Phase I drug metabolizing enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 were detected by Western blot analyses and, when appropriate, by enzymatic assays for ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase(EROD)-activity and testosterone-6beta-hydroxylase(T6H)-activity. Expression of the membrane transporter multi-drug resistance protein (P-glycoprotein, MDR-1), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP-1), and lung-resistance protein (LRP) was maintained during the culture as detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Model inducers like rifampicin, phenobarbital, or 3-methylcholanthrene and beta-naphtoflavone were able to induce CYP1A or CYP3A4 as well as EROD or T6H activities for up to 30 days. CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2E1 expression was maintained but not inducible for 48 days. Also, rifampicin and phenobarbital were unable to increase MDR-1 and MRP-1 protein levels significantly.
