Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic active against multidrug-resistant gram-positive organisms. Our search of the literature found no published pediatric pharmacokinetic data. We report the use of pharmacokinetic analysis of daptomycin in a 13-year-old boy with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium endocarditis. Pharamcokinetic parameters were found to be significantly different from published adult parameters, such as a faster elimination rate, shorter half-life, and increased clearance. These age-related differences in the pharmacokinetic profile of daptomycin have significant dosing implications. As the use of this drug for off-label indications and in pediatric populations increases, it is important for clinicians to better understand the drug's pharmacokinetic profile in these patient populations.
