This broad-based meeting covered all areas of tropical medicine, from basic science to clinical aspects, and focused on the perspectives from both Western travelers and public health strategies in developing countries. There was considerable interest in the development, assessment and implementation of antimalarial drug treatments, ranging from the most effective way to use existing compounds, to the strategic arguments associated with the desirability, feasibility and implementation of combination chemotherapy. Finally, attention was focused on the use of molecular markers to track and predict the emergence of antimicrobial drug resistance.
