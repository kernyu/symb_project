A reversal of key HIV protease mutations against tipranavir has been observed in a patient undergoing a late salvage antiretroviral therapy. Our patient initially introduced tipranavir/ritonavir in absence of an optimized background and novel drug classes, and nevertheless he experienced a virological-immunological benefit. Our report is a contribution to the present debate around the role of each single HIV protease mutation, and the validation of mutational "scores" (like the so-called tipranavir weighted score), to be applied to last-generation protease inhibitor compounds initially targeted on patients with limited, residual therapeutic options.
