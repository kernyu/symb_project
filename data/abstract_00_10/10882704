We report the in vivo activity of the bis-triazole derivative D0870 against a variety of strains of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, including nitroimidazole/nitrofuran-resistant strains. In both acute and chronic murine models of the disease, treatment with D0870 at < or = 10 mg/kg on alternate days for a total of 20 doses provided 60-100% protection against death, regardless of the drug sensitivity of the infecting strain. In the acute model we obtained 70-100% parasitological cure in seven of the nine strains tested, including one intermediate and two highly drug-resistant strains. D0870 was able to cure 30-45% of animals chronically infected with various strains, including those harbouring the Colombiana strain, among which no cures were obtained with benznidazole. We also found that the anti-T. cruzi activity of D0870 is largely retained even if the hosts are immunosuppressed.
