OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of a commonly used immersion disinfectant upon three different impression materials and any subsequent effects on the abrasion resistance, hardness and surface detail reproduction of gypsum casts. DESIGN: A laboratory study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Under standardised conditions a total of 120 impressions were made of a ruled test block using irreversible hydrocolloid (Alginoplast), an 'alginate alternative' addition-cure silicone (Position Penta) and a conventional addition-cure silicone (President). The impressions were examined for surface detail reproduction prior to and after disinfection with Perform-ID. The type III casts were evaluated for surface detail reproduction, surface hardness and abrasion resistance. RESULTS: (1) None of the disinfected alginate specimens could reproduce the 50 microm line. (2) Casts produced from the disinfected alginate were significantly less hard than from disinfected Position Penta and President (P <0.001). (3) Disinfection significantly affected the abrasion resistance of casts made from Position Penta (P = 0.029). (4) Disinfection did not significantly affect President or its subsequent casts (P >0.05). CONCLUSION: If disinfecting with Perform-ID, the impression should be made with a conventional addition-cured silicone if good surface detail reproduction of the impression material and a hard and abrasion resistant type III gypsum cast are required.
