We evaluated the in vitro activity of fosfomycin against 75 clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Using the NCCLS breakpoint for susceptibility of urinary tract isolates to fosfomycin (MIC > or = 256), 51 out of 52 Enterococcus faecium and all Enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were susceptible or intermediate to fosfomycin.
