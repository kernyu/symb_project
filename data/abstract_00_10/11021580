Avoparcin was used as a feed additive in Norwegian broiler and turkey production from 1986 until 1995. It was banned due to the selection of VanA-type vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in animal husbandry and to reduce the potential for human exposure to VRE. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of VRE carriage in Norwegian poultry farmers and their poultry three years after avoparcin was banned. Corresponding faecal samples from poultry and humans on farms where avoparcin had previously been used (exposed farms, n = 73) and farms where avoparcin had never been used (unexposed farms, n = 74) were analysed for the presence of VRE. For each farm, one sample from the poultry house and one sample from the farmer were obtained. VRE were isolated from 72 of 73 (99%) and eight of 74 (11%) poultry samples from exposed and unexposed farms, respectively. VRE were isolated from 13 of 73 (18%) and one of 74 (1%) farmer samples from exposed and unexposed farms, respectively. All VRE isolates were highly resistant to vancomycin and possessed the vanA gene, as shown by PCR. The high prevalence of VRE is in accordance with previous Norwegian studies, and shows a remarkable stability of the VanA resistance determinant in an apparently non-selective environment.
