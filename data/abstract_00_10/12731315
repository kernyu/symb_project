Severe forms of Plasmodium falciparum malaria are one of the world's leading causes of infection-related death in children. The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a set of severity criteria to improve diagnosis and speed antimalarial treatment. Although the pertinence of these criteria has not been documented in France, child travelers presenting such features require hospitalization in intensive care. The gold standard therapy is intravenous administration of quinine. According WHO recommendations, quinine therapy should begin with a loading dose barring contraindications. However French recommendations do not include the loading dose due to potentially dangerous side-effects in young children and lack of proven life-saving effect. Artemisinin derivatives have been shown to be as effective as quinine and are increasingly used in endemic zones due to good tolerance and convenience of use. However due to concerns about neurotoxicity, artemisinin derivatives are rarely used in France, except in patients with contraindications or resistance to quinine. Management of specific complications is also necessary to reduce the high mortality of severe malaria, even in Western countries, and to prevent neurological damage.
