The aroA-M1 encoding the mutant of 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) was introduced into the Brassica juncea genome by sonication-assisted, pollen-mediated transformation. The plasmid DNA and collected pollen grains were mixed in 0.3 mol/L sucrose solution and treated with mild ultrasonication. The treated pollen was then pollinated onto the oilseed stigmas after the stamens were removed artificially. Putative transgenic plants were obtained by screening germinating seeds on a medium containing glyphosate. Southern blot analysis of glyphosate-resistant plants indicated that the aroA-M1 gene had been integrated into the oilseed genome. Western blot analysis further confirmed that the EPSPS coded by aroA-M1 gene was expressed in transgenic plants. The transgenic plants exhibited increased resistance to glyphosate compared to untransformed plants. Some of those transgenic plants had considerably high resistance to glyphosate. The genetic analysis of T1 progeny further confirmed that the inheritance of the introduced genes followed the Mendelian rules. The results indicated that foreign genes can be transferred by pollen-mediated transformation combined with mild ultrasonication.
