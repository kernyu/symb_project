BACKGROUND: Several proinflammatory cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. A significant role has been given to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) as a guide proinflammatory cytokine. Thalidomide selectively reduces TNF-alpha production by inflammatory cells. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of thalidomide to induce and maintain remission in refractory Crohn disease. METHODS: The decision to administer thalidomide was made on the basis of patient intolerance or resistance to conventional medical treatment or as the last medical resort before surgical intervention. Only 5 of 96 patients with inflammatory bowel disease satisfied these criteria. All five patients had Crohn disease (male: mean age, 17 years). Thalidomide was administered at night at a dose of 1.5-2 mg/kg/day. The Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index, modified Harvey-Bradshaw scores, and steroids reduction were used to assess clinical response. RESULTS: Disease activity decreased consistently in four patients with a reduction of mean Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index from 36,9 to 2,5 and the mean Harvey-Bradshaw from 8.5 to 0.75 after 3 months of treatment. Steroid treatment (mean dose, 35 mg/day before treatment) was tapered and then discontinued, in four patients, within 1-3 months. Four patients are in remission after 19-24 months of treatment. The fifth patient discontinued thalidomide after 1 week because of distal paresthesia. CONCLUSION: Thalidomide seems to be an effective and safe treatment in patients with refractory Crohn disease. This is the first report of long-term use of thalidomide in refractory Crohn disease in pediatric patients.
