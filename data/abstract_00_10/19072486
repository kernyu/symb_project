Clinicians should be familiar with sex-specific considerations when managing antiretroviral (ARV) treatment among women. Pregnancy is a critical influence on when to start treatment and what ARVs should be included in a regimen. Sex, pregnancy and hormonal contraceptive therapies can each influence ARV pharmacokinetic profiles. Women may be prone to have higher serum levels with selected ARV treatments, which may improve potency but also increase the risk for toxicities. Several studies have demonstrated that women do have higher frequencies of selected ARV-associated adverse events when compared with men. Although HIV treatment guidelines for nonpregnant women do not differ from men, clinicians should be aware of the high potential for certain ARV-related toxicities and follow suggestions in order to decrease the risk of side effects.
