Class II MHC mutant bm12 mice have an increased resistance to experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) compared to C57BL/6 mice. In vitro, this relative resistance was mainly associated with a reduced cytokine response to acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and its dominant pathogenic peptide alpha 146-162, whereas the response to the epitope alpha 111-126 remained intact. Calcium mobilization after stimulation of AChR-immune T cells with AChR or alpha 146-162 peptide, but not alpha 111-126 peptide, was decreased in bm12 compared to C57BL/6. Thus, the reduced incidence of clinical EAMG in bm12 is linked to lower IFN-gamma and IL-10 release, and intracellular calcium mobilization by alpha 146-162-specific T cells.
