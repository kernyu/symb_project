Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a growing infectious concern, mainly in the context of its rapid adaptation to novel antibiotic options for its treatment and the growing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with its emergence. the authors sought to investigate whether an older antibiotic, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), may have a role in treating MRSA-related infections, according to the available literature on the subject. The authors reviewed literature data on: resistance of MRSA to SXT worldwide in recent years, efficacy of SXT for MRSA decolonization or prophylaxis from MRSA infections, and clinical therapeutic efficacy of SXT in treating mild or severe community-acquired or hospital-acquired MRSA infections. Resistance varies worldwide, in general being low in the industrialized world and higher in developing countries. SXT is one of the numerous understudied options for MRSA decolonization and is growingly recognized as potentially effective in preventing MRSA infections in certain settings. Limited data on its therapeutic efficacy are encouraging, at least for mild, community-acquired infections. SXT may represent a cost-effective alternative weapon against MRSA. Its utility against this increasingly threatening pathogen need clarification through further clinical trials.
