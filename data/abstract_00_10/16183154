A mail survey of 235 Western Australian sheep farmers who had performed faecal egg count reduction tests for anthelmintic resistance in 1999 or 2000 was conducted, with some telephone follow-up. A response of 56% was achieved. Resistance to ivermectin, a member of the macrocyclic lactone class of anthelmintics, had developed on 44% of the farms surveyed. We used time to occurrence of resistance to ascertain factors that contributed to extending the time ivermectin remained an effective drench on these farms (median time=10.5 years). This time was significantly longer when farmers implemented more worm control practices on their farms (P=0.003). We developed a multivariable survival model that contained the following main effects: reduced winter drenching frequency, 0-2 flock treatments in 5 years (hazard ratio (HR) 0.52); availability of alternative effective anthelmintic classes on the farm (HR 0.30); always using safe pastures (HR 0.23); and veterinarians as the primary source of worm control advice (HR 0.58). The relationship of these findings to the understanding of anthelmintic resistance is discussed.
