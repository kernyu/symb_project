Ethambutol resistance in clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates is associated primarily with missense mutations in the embB gene. However, recent reports have described the presence of embB mutations, especially those at embB codon 306, in isolates susceptible to ethambutol. To clarify the role of embB mutations in ethambutol resistance, we sequenced the ethambutol resistance-determining region in spontaneous ethambutol-resistant mutants. In our study, 66% of spontaneous mutants contained a single point mutation in embB, with 55% of these occurring at embB 306. The MIC of ethambutol for spontaneous mutants was increased two- to eightfold relative to the pansusceptible M. tuberculosis strains from which the mutants were generated. To further characterize the role of embB 306 mutations, we directly introduced mutant alleles, embB(M306V) or embB(M306I), into pansusceptible M. tuberculosis strains and conversely reverted mutant alleles in spontaneous ethambutol-resistant mutants back to those of the wild type via allelic exchange using specialized linkage transduction. We determined that the MIC of ethambutol was reduced fourfold for three of the four spontaneous ethambutol-resistant embB 306 mutants when the mutant allele was replaced with the wild-type embB allele. The MIC for one of the spontaneous mutants genetically reverted to wild-type embB was reduced by only twofold. When the wild-type embB allele was converted to the mutant allele embB(M306V), the ethambutol MIC was increased fourfold, and when the allele was changed to M306I, the ethambutol MIC increased twofold. Our data indicate that embB 306 mutations are sufficient to confer ethambutol resistance, and detection of these mutations should be considered in the development of rapid molecular tests.
