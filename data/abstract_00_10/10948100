The recent development of acellular pertussis vaccines has been a significant improvement in the conventional whole-cell diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus toxoid vaccines, but high production costs will limit its widespread use in developing countries. Since Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination against tuberculosis is used in most developing countries, a recombinant BCG-pertussis vaccine could be a more viable alternative. We have constructed recombinant BCG (rBCG) strains expressing the genetically detoxified S1 subunit of pertussis toxin 9K/129G (S1PT) in fusion with either the beta-lactamase signal sequence or the whole beta-lactamase protein, under control of the upregulated M. fortuitum beta-lactamase promoter, pBlaF*. Expression levels were higher in the fusion with the whole beta-lactamase protein, and both were localized to the mycobacterial cell wall. The expression vectors were relatively stable in vivo, since at two months 85% of the BCG recovered from the spleens of vaccinated mice maintained kanamycin resistance. Spleen cells from rBCG-S1PT-vaccinated mice showed elevated gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and low interleukin-4 (IL-4) production, as well as increased proliferation, upon pertussis toxin (PT) stimulation, characterizing a strong antigen-specific Th1-dominant cellular response. The rBCG-S1PT strains induced a low humoral response against PT after 2 months. Mice immunized with rBCG-S1PT strains displayed high-level protection against an intracerebral challenge with live Bordetella pertussis, which correlated with the induction of a PT-specific cellular immune response, reinforcing the importance of cell-mediated immunity in the protection against B. pertussis infection. Our results suggest that rBCG-expressing pertussis antigens could constitute an effective, low-cost combined vaccine against tuberculosis and pertussis.
