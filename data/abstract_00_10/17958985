OBJECTIVES: To assess the current anti-tuberculosis drug resistance situation in Cotonou, at the largest anti-tuberculosis centre of Benin. METHODS: A total of 470 isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients were analysed: 244 from new cases and 226 from previously treated cases. Drug susceptibility testing of isolates against first-line drugs was performed using the proportion method. RESULTS: Primary multidrug resistance (MDR) depends on the patients' origin: MDR in new cases is relatively high (1.6%) when all patients are considered, but low (0.5%) and comparable to 1994 national survey results when only patients residing in Benin are considered. MDR in previously treated patients (11.1%) remains comparable to the study performed in Benin in 1994. No relation was found between human immunodeficiency virus co-infection and anti-tuberculosis drug resistance. CONCLUSION: This study shows the great importance of correct patient identification in epidemiological surveys, where results may vary according to the population(s) studied.
