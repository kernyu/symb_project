The purpose of this article was not to review all reported adverse reactions of antibiotics used in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections but rather to focus either on those which might have an impact on observance, efficacy, and resistance, or on rare but life-threatening adverse effects such as torsade de pointe. The latter are mostly predictable and prescribers should adhere to precautions and contraindications. For new antibiotics, the number of patients enrolled in phase I to III clinical trials is far to small to detect such rare adverse effects and large post registration tolerance surveys are mandatory. ss-lactams are well tolerated. The risk of anaphylactic reaction is magnified by patient reports and can be reduced by skin testing. Macrolides are well tolerated as well. The risk of cardiac toxicity should be reduced by assessing individual susceptibility and avoiding drug interactions. The tolerance to telithromycin, a new ketolide, is similar to that of macrolides. Serious toxic reactions such as convulsions, tendon rupture, torsade de pointe, and hypoglycemia are associated with the use of fluoroquinolones. Most of these adverse reactions can be often circumvented by avoiding exposure patients at risk. Quinupristin/dalfopristin can induce arthralgia and myalgia and the major adverse effects of linezolid are IMAO like reactions, reversible myelosuppression, and peripheral neuropathy. Most of the adverse antibiotic reactions are reported when precautions of use in susceptible patients are not taken into account. When they are, the safety/risk ratio is good.
