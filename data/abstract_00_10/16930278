Experiments to demonstrate the transfer of genes within a natural environment are technically difficult because of the unknown numbers and strains of bacteria present, as well as difficulties designing adequate control experiments. The results of such studies should be viewed within the limits of the experimental design. Most experiments to date have been based on artificial models, which only give approximations of the real-life situation. The current study uses more natural models and provides information about tetracycline resistance as it occurs in wild-type bacteria within the environment of the normal intestinal tract of an animal. Tetracycline sensitive, nalidixic acid resistant Escherichia coli isolates of human origin were administered to mice and chicken animal models. They were monitored for acquisition of tetracycline resistance from indigenous or administered donor E. coli. Five sets of in vivo experiments demonstrated unequivocal transfer of tetracycline resistance to tetracycline sensitive recipients. The addition of tetracycline in the drinking water of the animals increased the probability of transfer between E. coli strains originating from the same animal species. The co-transfer of unselected antibiotic resistance in animal models was also demonstrated.
