The number of travellers in malaria striken areas increases each year (2). The risk of infection is high in Sub-Saharan Africa, but appropriate chemoprophylaxis can reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of malaria. Half of the samples of malaria cases received by the National reference centre of malaria chemosensibility (CNRCP) for chemosensibility analysis came from two hospitals in the north of Paris: Bichat Claude Bernard in Paris and Delafontaine in Saint-Denis. In 2000, quite all the malaria cases (n = 387) observed at the Bichat and Delafontaine Hospitals came from Africa (99%). Plasmodium falciparum remains the most represented (87.6%) species, with an average parasitic density of 0.3%. Patients with P falciparum came for medical advice on the tenth day after return (median, extremes 0-174 days). More than half of the patients (58%) did not take any medication for chemoprophylaxis and even if they took some, it was irregular or inappropriate. The most used drug chemoprophylaxis is the association of chloroquine and proguanil or Savarine. In 15% of the cases, the travellers took chloroquine as a prophylaxis and 4% other medicine not recommended by the French authorities. An average of 43.7% of these travellers took inappropriate chemoprophylaxis. In total, 27 chemoprophylaxis failures are reported. Some patients (22%) have already taken self treatment which was readjusted during admission at hospital. The first treatment of malaria in 2000 was monotherapy with quinine (P. falciparum) and chloroquine (P. ovale, malariae, vivax). The treatment associations in case of suspicious resistance were quinine + doxycycline and atovaquone + proguanil. Treatment failure was infrequent and resulted above all from a bad observance. More information should be given to travellers as well as doctors about recommendations and treatments.
