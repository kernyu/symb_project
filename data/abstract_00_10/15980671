BACKGROUND/AIMS: Adefovir dipivoxil is effective in patients with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, little is known about its role in Korean patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of adefovir dipivoxil in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis with lamivudine resistance, and we compared this to the patients having compensated liver disease. METHODS: The patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic liver disease were enrolled and they received adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg daily. The clinical course and the biochemical and virological response of the decompensated cirrhosis group were compared with those of the patients with compensated liver disease group. RESULTS: One-hundred and one patients (the decompensated cirrhosis group, n=53; the compensated liver disease group, n=48) were evaluated. During the following up, 13 patients in the decompensated group and 4 patients in the compensated group dropped out of the treatment (P=0.011). After adefovir treatment, the proportion of patients with serum HBV DNA below 0.5 pg/mL in the decompensated group was less than that in the compensated group (50.9% vs. 83.3%, P=0.001), but the rates of normalized ALT, HBeAg loss and HBeAg seroconversion did not differ. The change of the Child-Pugh score in the decompensated group was 9.1 +/- 1.8 to 6.9 +/- 1.6 (P<0.001). The biochemical response in decompensated group was slower than that in the compensated group. Renal toxicity was not observed in either group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that adefovir dipivoxil would be an effective and safe treatment for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis with lamivudine resistance, but its effect might be limited and slower for decompensated cirrhosis.
