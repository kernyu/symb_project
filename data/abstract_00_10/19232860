The in vitro activity of penicillin, ampicillin, cefditoren, cefotaxime, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and levofloxacin against 763 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes was determined. Clinically significant isolates collected from November 2005 to December 2006 in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania (the latter 3 analyzed as Baltic countries) were studied. No resistance to beta-lactams and levofloxacin was found. The rate of erythromycin resistance in S. pyogenes varied among countries, being low (<10%) in Romania and Baltic countries, intermediate (10-20%) in Poland and Czech Republic, and high (>25%) in Hungary and Slovakia. The predominant (75.0%) erythromycin-resistant phenotype among S. pyogenes isolates was MLS(B). The identification of the prevalence of erythromycin resistance mechanism could have impact on the choice of empiric antibiotic therapy for the clinicians in such countries.
