Out of 350 acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) patients 110 (31.4%) were positive on culture. Among then (35.5%) yielded from upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and 64.5% yielded from lower respiratory tract infection (LRI). Predominant bacterial isolates from URI were Staph aureus (12.4%) and Strepto. pyogen (9.8%) whereas predominant agent from LRI were Strepto. pneumoniae (14.7%) and Haemophilus influenzae (8.6%). Capsular typing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and type specific antisera revealed that 64.7% of the isolates were type-b and rest were non-b. The most frequent resistance pattern of H. influenzae was found resistant to penicillin-ampicillin (64.7%) followed by SMX-TMP (14.7%) and tetracycline (5.9%). Among penicillin-ampicillin resistant strains, 81.8% were beta lectamase positive and 18.2% were beta lectamase negative. Among beta lectamase positive strains 66.7% were capsular type-b and 33.3% were non-b, had MICS < or = 8 microgram/ml. and < or = 4 microgram/ml. respectively. 5.9% strains of Strepto. pneumoniae was found resistant to SMX-TMP, 5.9% to penicillin-ampicillin and 2.9% to cephalexin. Common resistance pattern of Staph aureus was penicillin-ampicillin (60%), SMX-TMP (37.2%) and tetracycline-erythromycine-cephalexin (11.4%). Strepto. pyogen was found resistant to tetracycline in 12.2% cases and to SMX-TMP in 8.3% cases.
