In dealing with malaria, the challenge that remains is prompt diagnosis and initiation of specific and supportive treatment. Physicians should be aware of the therapeutic and prognostic implications of life-threatening falciparum vs. non-falciparum malaria and be able to at least recognize the severe manifestations of malaria which may require an increased level of care or referral to a specialist unit. The most important new developments in managing malaria in patients are the increasing problem of drug resistance, the availability of new antimalarial agents (most notably the artemisinins) and general advances in the management of any acutely ill patient in critical care.
