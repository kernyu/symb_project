To define more precisely the inoculation methods to be used in the oxacillin screen test for Staphylococcus aureus, we tested agar screen plates prepared in house with 6 microg of oxacillin/ml and 4% NaCl using the four different inoculation methods that would most likely be used by clinical laboratories. The organisms selected for testing were 19 heteroresistant mecA-producing strains and 41 non-mecA-producing strains for which oxacillin MICs were near the susceptible breakpoint. The inoculation method that was preferred by all four readers and that resulted in the best combination of sensitivity and specificity was a 1-microl loopful of a 0.5 McFarland suspension. A second objective of the study was to then use this method to inoculate plates from five different manufacturers of commercially prepared media. Although all commercial media performed with acceptable sensitivity compared to the reference lot, one of the commercial lots demonstrated a lack of specificity. Those lots of oxacillin screen medium that fail to grow heteroresistant strains can be detected by using S. aureus ATCC 43300 as a positive control in the test and by using transmitted light to carefully examine the plates for any growth. However, lack of specificity with commercial lots may be difficult to detect using any of the current quality control organisms.
