A library of 5''-modified neomycin derivatives were synthesized for an antibacterial structure-activity optimization strategy. Two leads exhibited prominent activity against both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Antibacterial activities were measured when combined with other clinically used antibiotics. Significant synergistic activities were observed, which may lead to the development of novel therapeutic practices in the battle against infectious bacteria.
