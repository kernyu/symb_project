Clostridium perfringens is responsible for a number of clinical conditions ranging from relatively mild food poisoning to the potentially life-threatening gas gangrene. Fortunately, C. perfringens has remained relatively susceptible to first line antibiotics in the treatment of soft tissue infection, however, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance is increasing amongst other anaerobic organisms. A case of anaerobic cellulitis caused by a clindamycin-resistant C. perfringens is described here, emphasising the emerging problem of antimicrobial resistance.
