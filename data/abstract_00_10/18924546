Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CAMRSA) strains continue to emerge as important causes of sepsis, folliculitis, skin abscesses, necrotizing pneumonitis, empyema, and bone and joint infections. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant S aureus often affects young, previously healthy individuals, including athletes and children in day care. Drainage remains the most important intervention for an abscess. The most common CAMRSA strains in the United States, Canada, and Europe remain sensitive to sulfonamides and tetracycline. Rates of clindamycin resistance vary widely geographically, and physicians should be familiar with their local antibiogram data. Multidrug-resistant strains of CAMRSA are emerging, and the routine addition of antibiotics such as tetracycline to animal feed is contributing to the emergence of resistance. Recurrence and spread of infection can be reduced by addressing the carrier state. Strategies for treatment and elimination of staphylococcal carriage are discussed.
