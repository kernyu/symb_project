Bacteroides spp. organisms, though important human commensals, are also opportunistic pathogens when they escape the colonic milieu. Resistance to multiple antibiotics has been increasing in Bacteroides spp. for decades, and is primarily due to horizontal gene transfer of a plethora of mobile elements. The mechanistic aspects of conjugation in Bacteroides spp. are only now being elucidated at a functional level. There appear to be key differences between Bacteroides spp. and non-Bacteroides spp. conjugation systems that may contribute to promiscuous gene transfer within and from this genus. This review summarizes the mechanisms of action and resistance of antibiotics used to treat Bacteroides spp. infections, and highlights current information on conjugation-based DNA exchange.
