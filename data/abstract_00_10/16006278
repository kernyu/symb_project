Despite the advent of new antibiotics, resistance in gram-positive pathogens, including staphylococci and enterococci, continues to increase. This is evident with the recent emergence of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus . Newer treatment agents are available, including quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin. In addition, investigational agents are being explored. Clinical trials have been conducted for various infections, such as skin and skin structure infections, pneumonia, and bloodstream infections. Antibacterial activity, site of infection, and potential for adverse effects must be taken into account when making decisions regarding therapy.
