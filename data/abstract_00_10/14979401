Thrombosis has been considered an uncommon complication in patients with AIDS. In a 42-month period, 28 adult male homosexuals with AIDS experienced 34 thrombotic events. All but three received HAART regimen, two a successful round of double nucleoside analog therapy, and one patient received no treatment. Median age of group was 38.5 years (range, 24 to 56 years). Median time from HIV infection to thrombosis was 40.5 months (range, 3 to 108 months). No patient had previous thrombosis, family history of thrombosis, or prothrombotic conditions. There were 31 deep vein thromboses, two pulmonary thromboembolisms, and one renal vein thrombosis. Six patients had two thrombotic events. The rate of thrombosis during the 42-month study period was 1.52% (cumulative incidence = 0.30%/year), while the rate of thrombosis in 600 patients before the era of protease inhibitor therapy was 0.33% (cumulative incidence approximately 0.055%/year) (p < 0.001). Due to high incidence of thrombotic recurrences and hemorrhagic complications while using oral anticoagulants, acetylsalicylic acid was initiated; no thrombotic episodes were recorded while using this drug. Protein C and protein S deficiency were found in nine and two patients, respectively. Two patients had lupus anticoagulant and two activated protein C resistance (APCR) without FV Leiden mutation (APCR test was negative after initial screening). Fifteen patients had no thrombophilic abnormalities. These data suggest that protease inhibitors could be a risk factor for venous thrombosis not due to thrombophilic abnormalities but likely related to abnormalities in platelets or endothelium.
