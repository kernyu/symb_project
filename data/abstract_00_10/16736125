The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies embody the largest group of acquired and potentially treatable causes of skeletal muscle weakness. The three major groups of this disorder are polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), and inclusion body myositis. Corticosteroids continue to be the mainstay of initial treatment in the majority of cases of PM/DM. The treatment of refractory disease can be challenging despite the utilization of the medications currently available. We report two patients with refractory DM who were treated with infliximab. We describe their presentation, clinical course, treatment, and outcomes.
