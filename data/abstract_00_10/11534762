The activation of NF-kappaB induced by kojic acid, an inhibitor of tyrosinase for biosynthesis of melanin in melanocytes, was investigated in human transfectant HaCaT and SCC-13 cells. These two keratinocyte cell lines transfected with pNF-kappaB-SEAP-NPT plasmid were used to determine the activation of NF-kappaB. Transfectant cells release the secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as a transcription reporter in response to the NF-kappaB activity and contain the neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT) gene for the dominant selective marker of geneticin resistance. NF-kappaB activation was measured in the SEAP reporter gene assay using a fluorescence detection method. Kojic acid showed the inhibition of cellular NF-kappaB activity in both human keratinocyte transfectants. It could also downregulate the ultraviolet ray (UVR)-induced activation of NF-kappaB expression in transfectant HaCaT cells. Moreover, the inhibitory activity of kojic acid in transfectant HaCaT cells was found to be more potent than known antioxidants, e.g., vitamin C and N-acetyl-L-cysteine. These results indicate that kojic acid is a potential inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation in human keratinocytes, and suggest the hypothesis that NF-kappaB activation may be involved in kojic acid induced anti-melanogenic effect.
