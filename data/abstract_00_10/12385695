Gentamicin-susceptible, methicillin-resistant, Stapylococcus aureus strains (GS-MRSA) emerged in 1992 in various Parisian hospitals and have subsequently been isolated from all French hospitals. This new GS-MRSA epidemic clone accounted for 50% of MRSA strains in 1996 and for 85% in 2000 in our hospital. We have observed a parallel increase in the prevalence of tobramycin and amikacin-susceptible GS-MRSA (TKS-MRSA). The number of TKS-MRSA strains per 100 MRSA strains has steadily increased from 3.1 in 1996 to 24.0 in 2000. Genotypic characterization of TKS-MRSA strains showed that these strains are a phenotypic variant of the dominant clone of GS-MRSA. To improve our understanding of the changes in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) susceptibility to non-beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin- and amikacin-susceptible MRSA (TKS-MRSA) from our acute-care hospital were compared with TKS-MRSA isolated from a long-term care hospital located in another region of France. The nature of the care facility did not seem to play a major role in the hospital dissemination of TKS-MRSA. We also found that changes in antibiotic use alone do not account for the emergence of these strains.
