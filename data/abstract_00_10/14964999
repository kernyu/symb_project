The paper presents the results of M. tuberculosis drug resistance analysis. The material was phlegm obtained from 1060 patients treated during 1994-2001 y.y. The tendency of rising of M. tuberculosis drug resistance rate and polyresistance has been established. Unfortunately, a great deal of patients were undercovered with drug resistance M. tuberculosis which can massively grow on cultural medium with peak concentration of streptomycin, kanamycin, rifampicin and PAS(A), as stated above it necessitates to modernize the inspection system directed to determine M. tuberculosis drug resistance.
