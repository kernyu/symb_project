OBJECTIVE: To investigate the drug resistance of flavobacterium and its ability to produce BLA (beta-lactamases) and ESBLs (Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases). METHODS: The production of BLA and ESBLs from 6 clinical isolated flavobacterium strains was determined by nitrocefin disc test and double-disc synergy method, respectively. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the strains were determined by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion test and the agar dilution method and the MIC was assessed. RESULTS: All the six flavobacteria were BLA-producing strains and more than 80% of them were ESBLs-producing, and they were highly resistant to beta-lactamase antibiotics (MIC 32 - 256 mg/L), but susceptible to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporin with beta-lactamase inhibitors (MIC 0.125 - 8 mg/L). CONCLUSION: Most of the flavobacteria in nosocomial infections were beta-lactamase-producing and were highly resistant to beta-lactamase antibiotics. Fluoroquinolones and beta-lactamase antibiotics with lactamase inhibitors should be the first choice for the management of infection caused by flavobacterium.
