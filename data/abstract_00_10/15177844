Geriatric patients frequently are cared for in long term care facilities (LTCFs), which are now a major component of our health care delivery system. Nearly half of the 2.2 million people who turned 65 years old in 1990 will enter an LTCF at least once before they die. Infections are one of the principal causes of morbidity and mortality in LTCFs. Because LTCFs are a less costly alternative to hospitalization, clinicians are treating many serious infections in the nursing home. As a result of antibiotic use, LTCFs will increasingly be recognized as sources of organisms resistant to multiple antibiotics. b-Lactams are a valuable class of potent antimicrobials with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. The safety and efficacy of this class of antibiotics make them easy choices for empiric treatment of infections in the elderly. Unfortunately, excessive use of these antibiotics has created serious threats to our therapeutic armamentarium: the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and of Gram-negative pathogens resistant to third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. Of these third-generation cephalosporins, resistance to ceftazidime is most frequently recognized. The major mechanism responsible for ceftazidime resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is the production of b-lactamases. This article summarizes the diversity of b-lactamases, highlights the important enzymes that confer ceftazidime resistance in LTCFs, and details some methods used to identify and characterize these enzymes. A clear challenge is to apply these techniques to epidemiologic and molecular studies conducted in LTCFs.
