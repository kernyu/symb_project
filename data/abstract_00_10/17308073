The oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway triggers downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/RAS-mediated signaling cascades. In transgenic mice, glioblastoma cannot develop on single but only on simultaneous activation of the EGFR signaling mediators RAS and AKT. However, complete blockade of EGFR activation does not result in apoptosis in human glioblastoma cells, suggesting additional cross-talk between downstream pathways. Based on these observations, we investigated combination therapies using protein kinase inhibitors against EGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and mammalian target of rapamycin, assessing glioblastoma cell survival. Clinically relevant doses of AEE788, Gleevec (imatinib), and RAD001 (everolimus), alone or in combinations, did not induce glioblastoma cell apoptosis. In contrast, simultaneous inactivation of the EGFR downstream targets mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase and PI3K by U0126 and wortmannin triggered rapid tumor cell death. Blocking EGFR with AEE788 in combination with sublethal concentrations of the microtubule stabilizer patupilone also induced apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation in glioblastoma cells, accompanied by reduced AKT and ERK activity. These data underline the critical role of the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase/ERK signaling cascades in the cell-intrinsic survival program of sensitive glioblastoma cell lines. We conclude that drug combinations, which down-regulate both ERK and protein kinase B/AKT activity, may prove effective in overcoming cell resistance in a subgroup of glioblastoma.
