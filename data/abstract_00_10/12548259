Clostridium Difficile diarrhea was noted in a previously healthy health care worker from the study institution after receiving oral clindamycin therapy; the worker also had vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus stool colonization. Health care workers should be aware that antibiotic therapy may place them at increased risk for colonization and infection with nosocomial pathogens such as Clostridium difficile and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
