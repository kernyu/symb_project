Representative strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus showed differences in susceptibility to members of the monobactam group of beta-lactam antibiotics: S. sobrinus was less sensitive than S. mutans. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of aztreonam (AZT) and carumonam, both of which belong to this group, were 2,000 microg/ml for S. sobrinus and 125 microg/ml for S. mutans. Further addition of fosfomycin, bacitracin and sodium chloride to Mitis Salivarius agar (MS) supplemented with AZT resulted in growth inhibition of S. mutans and oral streptococci other than S. sobrinus, and was therefore used as a selective medium for S. sobrinus (MS-SOB medium). The average growth recovery of laboratory and clinically isolated strains of S. sobrinus on MS-SOB medium was 74.1% compared to that on MS medium. Seventy-eight percent of clinical samples in which S. sobrinus was detected yielded pure growth of S. sobrinus on MS-SOB medium.
