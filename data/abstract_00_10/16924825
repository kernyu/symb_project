Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) have been proposed as alternatives to currently used antimalarials and are poised large-scale deployment in Africa. These combinations are particularly attractive for managing malaria in children. Expected benefits of ACT include enhanced efficacy, rapid action, stabilized antimalarial resistance growth and lower malaria transmission. This article discusses what can be reasonably expected of ACT in an African setting with emphasis on patient comfort.
