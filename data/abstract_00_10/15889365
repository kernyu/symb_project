Telithromycin, a recently approved ketolide antibiotic derived from 14-membered macrolides, is active against erythromycin-resistant pneumococci. Telithromycin has enhanced activity in vitro because it binds not only to domain V of ribosomal RNA (like macrolides do) but also to domain II. However, it is not active against streptococci and staphylococci with constitutive macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B resistance. Telithromycin, available in an oral formulation, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in adults for treatment of (1) community-acquired pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multidrug-resistant isolates), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae; (2) acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis due to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or M. catarrhalis; or (3) acute bacterial sinusitis due to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or methicillin- and erythromycin-susceptible Streptococcus aureus. It is not approved for treatment of tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or severe pneumococcal pneumonia. Unique visual adverse effects occurred in 0.27%-2.1% of patients receiving telithromycin therapy. Its enhanced activity against some common respiratory pathogens makes it a valuable addition to the available macrolides.
