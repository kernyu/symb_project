Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) at a suboptimal concentration for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (10 mg once daily) can be used to treat hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in HIV-1-HBV-coinfected patients and does not, even in the case of uncontrolled HIV-1 replication, select for either ADV mutations at codons 65 and 70 or any other particular HIV-1 reverse transcriptase resistance profile.
