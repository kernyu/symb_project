We describe the development of nonsusceptibility to daptomycin and vancomycin during treatment for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia associated with infective endocarditis and probable septic thrombophlebitis in a uremic patient. MRSA bacteremia persisted during glycopeptide and subsequent daptomycin treatment but cleared after 5 days' treatment with linezolid and fusidic acid.
