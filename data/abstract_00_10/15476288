A series of 4-(5, 6-dichloro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-N-substituted benzamides were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant S. epidermis (MRSE), Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. Certain compounds inhibit bacterial growth with low MIC values (microg/mL). Among them, compounds 10 and 11 exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity with MIC values of 3.12 microg/mL against S. aureus, MRSA and MRSE.
