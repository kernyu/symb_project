P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is one of the ABC transporters responsible for the multidrug resistance of cancer cells. The conformational changes of Pgp that occur in the presence of substrates/modulators or ATP depletion are accompanied by the up-shift of UIC2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding. In the case of cyclosporin A, vinblastine or valinomycin, this up-shift was found to be concomitant with the near-complete suppression of labeling with other mAbs specific for Pgp epitopes overlapping with UIC2, while pre-treatment with verapamil or Tween 80 brings about a modest suppression. Here we have extended these observations to 44 Pgp interacting agents, and found that only 8 fall into the cyclosporin-like category, inducing a conformational state characterized by the complete UIC2 dominance. The rest of the drugs either did not affect antibody competition or had a modest effect. Thus, Pgp substrates/modulators can be classified into distinct modalities based on the conformational change they elicit.
