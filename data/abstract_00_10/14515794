AIM: To establish 3D QSAR model of propenamides with anti-malarial activities. METHODS: Chemical synthesis combined with comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA). RESULTS: Generated QSAR models for activities of inhibiting chloroquine resistive malaria (W2) and chloroquine sensitive malaria (D6). CONCLUSION: The activity of anti-W2 depends mostly on steric interaction and the activity of anti-D6 depends on both steric and electrostatic interaction.
