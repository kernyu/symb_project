PURPOSE: To examine the physiological function of the thioltransferase (TTase)/glutathione (GSH) system in the lens using TTase knockout mouse (TTase(-/-)) lens epithelial cells (LECs) as a model. METHODS: Primary LEC cultures were obtained from wild-type (TTase(+/+)) and TTase(-/-) mice. Characterization and validation of the cells were determined by immunoblotting for TTase and alpha-crystallin proteins and by immunohistochemistry for glutathionylated proteins. Cell proliferation was examined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium and BrdU analysis, and cell apoptosis after H(2)O(2) stress was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Reloading of TTase protein into the TTase(-/-) cells was achieved with reagent. RESULTS: Primary LEC cultures obtained from wild-type (TTase(+/+)) and TTase(-/-) mice were characterized and found to contain lens-specific alpha-crystallin protein. Western blot analysis confirmed the absence of TTase protein in the TTase(-/-) cells and its presence in the wild-type cells. TTase(-/-) LECs had significantly lower levels of glutathione (GSH) and protein thiols with extensive elevation of glutathionylated proteins, and they exhibited less resistance to oxidative stress than did TTase(+/+) cells. These cells were less viable and more apoptotic, and they had a reduced ability to remove H(2)O(2) after challenge with low levels of H(2)O(2). Reloading of purified TTase into the TTase(-/-) cells restored the antioxidant function in TTase(-/-) cells to a near normal state. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the importance of TTase in regulating redox homeostasis and suggest a new physiological function in controlling cell proliferation in the lens epithelial cells.
