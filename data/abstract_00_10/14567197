This work aimed to investigate resistance profiles towards beta-lactam antibiotics in correlation with beta-lactamases production in the genus Aeromonas. In a series of 417 wild-type strains, biochemical identification and testing with 11 beta-lactams by the disk-diffusion method revealed 5 predominant phenotypes: A. hydrophila complex/class B, C and D beta-lactamases; A. caviae complex/class C and D beta-lactamases; A. veronii complex/class B and D beta-lactamases; A. schubertii spp./class D beta-lactamase; A. trota spp./class C beta-lactamase. A subgroup of 64 representative strains was submitted to MIC determination with 8 beta-lactam compounds alone and in combination with 3 beta-lactamase inhibitors (clavulanic acid, tazobactam and BRL 42715). Visualisation of beta-lactamases and pI determination were performed in all these 64 isolates by isoelectric focusing from crude extracts. The different Aeromonas species produced 1 to 3 of the following inducible enzymes: an imipenemase with low expression, which is difficult to detect with routine phenotype studies (class B, pI 8, imipenem MIC > 2 micrograms/ml), a cephalosporinase (class C, pI > 7 +/- 0.5, cephalothin MIC > 256 micrograms/ml), and an oxacillinase widely produced in the genus Aeromonas (class D, pI > 8.5, ticarcillin MIC > 256 micrograms/ml). In Aeromonas spp. resistance profile to beta-lactam antibiotics is correlated with naturally occurring phenotypes of beta-lactamases production. As a conclusion, the characterisation of these different enzymes is of therapeutic and taxonomic interest, in species notoriously difficult to identify.
