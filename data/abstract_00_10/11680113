Numerous guidelines for CAP have been developed, and although each is different, many principles are common to all recommendations. A guideline should focus on a wide range of issues surrounding the delivery of care, including advice about when to admit patients to the hospital or ICU; which antibiotic regimens to select for specific patient populations; which pathogens to target in empiric therapy; which diagnostic tests to order; how to assess the importance of specific causative pathogens, such as drug-resistant pneumococci, atypical pathogens, and gram-negative pathogens; how to evaluate the response to therapy and when to switch responding patients to oral therapy; and how to prevent CAP effectively through appropriate use of immunization against pneumococcus and influenza. Currently, many new antibiotic choices have emerged in the macrolide, quinolone, beta-lactam, ketolide, and oxazolidinone classes, and specific issues surrounding selection of these agents must be considered. All of the available data can be synthesized into a disease management guideline, and current therapy in the United States generally is consistent with existing recommendations. This consistency not only has led to more uniformity in patient care, but also has led to measurable benefits in patient outcomes, including reduced mortality for hospitalized patients with CAP. Guidelines not only are a useful tool for managing patients with CAP, but also they serve the purpose of defining current issues in patient care and stimulating the search for new tools and management approaches for this important clinical problem.
