Seven carbapenem-resistant NDM-1-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were recovered from patients hospitalized between 2007 and 2009 in different wards at a referral and tertiary care center in Nairobi. Most of the isolates were obtained from urine. All isolates carried the bla(NDM-1) carbapenemase gene previously reported from India, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom. These isolates were clonally related and expressed many other resistance determinants, including beta-lactamases CTX-M-15, OXA-1, OXA-9, CMY-6, and aminoglycoside resistance methylase RmtC. This work corresponds to the first report of NDM-1 producers in Africa.
