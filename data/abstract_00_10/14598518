Isofon given in a dose of 800 mg daily for 1.5-2 months contributed to clinical and X-ray involution of a process in 16 of the 19 patients with acutely progressive destructive forms of tuberculosis. The drug proved to be effective in patients who isolated drug-resistant Mycobacteria tuberculosis, including those to a combination of isoniazide and rifampicin. When used in patients with significant immunodeficiency, isofon provided an immunomodulating effect. It caused relatively a great deal of adverse reactions as fever in 11 patients, weakness, dizziness in 5, and cardiac arrhythmia in 1. The findings show it necessary to perform further clinical trials of the drug.
