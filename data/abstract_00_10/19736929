We report here that nitazoxanide (NTZ) and its active metabolite kill replicating and nonreplicating M. tuberculosis at low microg/mL levels. NTZ appears to evade resistance, as we were unable to recover resistant colonies, using up to 10(12) colony forming units. Therefore, NTZ is a novel lead compound that kills replicating and nonreplicating M. tuberculosis by a novel mechanism of action, which appears to bypass the development of resistance.
