A total of 76 clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Taiwan were tested for pyrazinamidase activity, pyrazinamide susceptibility, and pncA mutations. Frequency of resistance to PZA rose with increases in resistance to first-line drugs. Of 17 pyrazinamide-resistant strains, 7 (3 of which had not been previously described) possessed mutations in the pncA gene.
