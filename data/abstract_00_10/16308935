Chemotherapeutic activity of 3-(5-nitrofuryl)-7-(5-nitrofurfuryliden)-3, 3a, 4, 5, 6, 7-hexahydro-2H-indazol (compound 26) was studied on albino mice with experimental staphylococcal infection. The animals were contaminated intraperitoneally. The results of culture of the specimens of the organs of the mice killed within various terms and the values of the spleen bacterial index served as the criteria of the effectiveness. Compound 26 was administered in doses of 20, 10 and 5 mg/kg once a day for 3 days. The treatment was started simultaneously with or 24 hours after the contamination. The results showed that compound 26 in a dose 20 mg/kg (0.4 mg/mouse) possessed high chemotherapeutic activity in experimental staphylococcal infection of albino mice and could be recommended for a thorough study as a potential agent for chemotherapy of staphylococcal infection.
