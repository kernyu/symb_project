BACKGROUND: Sepsis and endotoxemia attenuate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), thereby impairing systemic oxygenation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced lung injury. The authors investigated whether treatment with scavengers of ROS prevents impairment of HPV in mice challenged with endotoxin. METHODS: The pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to left mainstem bronchus occlusion (LMBO) was studied in anesthetized mice 22 h after an intraperitoneal challenge with saline solution or 10 mg/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin. In some mice, challenge with saline solution or endotoxin was followed after 1 h with intraperitoneal or intratracheal administration of the ROS scavengers N-acetylcysteine or EUK-8. Myeloperoxidase activity and nitric oxide synthase-2 gene expression were measured in lung tissues. RESULTS: The LMBO increased left pulmonary vascular resistance by 106 +/- 24% in saline-challenged control mice but by only 23 +/- 12% (P < 0.05) in endotoxin-challenged mice. Intraperitoneal administration of N-acetylcysteine or EUK-8 1 h after endotoxin challenge attenuated the endotoxin-induced impairment of HPV (58 +/- 6% and 68 +/- 10%, respectively; both P< 0.05 endotoxin-challenged mice). Intratracheal administration of ROS scavengers 1 h after endotoxin challenge was equally effective but required lower doses than systemic treatment. Administration of the ROS scavengers 22 h after endotoxin challenge did not restore HPV. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of N-acetylcysteine or EUK-8 1 h after endotoxin challenge in mice prevented the impairment of HPV after LMBO. Early therapy with ROS scavengers, either systemically or by inhalation, may provide a means to preserve HPV in sepsis-associated acute lung injury.
