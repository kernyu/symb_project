OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to analyse the risk factors involvement in the cross infectious pathology determined by multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae, in hospitalised patients in the Intensive Care Unit at the County Emergency Clinical Hospital in Timisoara. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We carried out a case-control study with 3 groups of adult inpatients--200 patients with no superadded infectious pathology, 100 patients infected with Enterobacteriaceae strains resistant to 3 classes of antibacterial chemotherapeutic agents and 100 infected with multiresistant strains. Identification of bacterial germs was performed using API ID 20 E manual galleries (BioMerieux) and the inclusion in the resistance phenotypes was done using the Osiris Evolution (BioRad) analyser. RESULTS: Subjects infected with multiresistant strains are mostly male, (p=0.020, OR=1.8 [1.06-3.07], RR=1.49, [1.05-2.11]), with the mean age younger than that of the control group (p=0.011). The mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 3.34 in Group III and 4.06 in Group I (p=0.027). The logistic regression application keeps as well as independent risk factors for multiresistance--the mechanical ventilation, consciousness impairment, prolonged hospitalization and the higher number of days of antibiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the nosocomial factors and basic pathology prevail to the detriment of other intrinsic risk factors.
