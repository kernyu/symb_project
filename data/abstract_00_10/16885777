HIV-1 genotypic resistance test results were obtained on clinical samples from 116 patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 75 copies/mL. Genotype validity was confirmed in 49 of 50 patients with a previous or follow-up genotype. The belief that genotypic resistance testing is unreliable in samples with low-level viremia should be reassessed.
