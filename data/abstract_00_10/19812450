Here, we describe a case of an HIV-infected patient with right lower limb oedema that appeared after initiation of tenofovir and emtricitabine treatment. The patient was fully investigated by serial heart and vessel echo-Doppler examination. Oedema of the lower limb was attributed to a transient drug-induced fivefold increase in peripheral artery flow, which was induced by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance. The possible mechanisms of disease are discussed.
