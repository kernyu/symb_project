The diversity of structures carrying the aac(6')-aph(2") gene was studied in 46 high-level gentamicin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium clinical strains recovered in a Tunisian hospital during the period 2000-2003. The inclusion of the aac(6')-aph(2") gene within the Tn4001 composite element or in its truncated forms (lacking the IS256 at the right, the left or at both sides of the aac(6')-aph(2") gene) was investigated by PCR and sequencing. The aac(6')-aph(2") gene was included in the composite Tn4001 element in 19 of 34 high-level gentamicin-resistant E. faecalis strains (56%) and in 1 of 12 E. faecium strains (12%). A truncated form of Tn4001 lacking IS256 at the left-hand (in 10 E. faecalis and 8 E. faecium), at the right-hand (3 E. faecalis and 2 E. faecium) or at both sides of the aac(6')-aph(2") gene (in 2 E. faecalis and 1 E. faecium) was also detected in 26 of our enterococci. The transference by conjugation of the aac(6')-aph(2") gene, associated with other resistance genes, was demonstrated in seven of the high-level gentamicin-resistant E. faecalis strains.
