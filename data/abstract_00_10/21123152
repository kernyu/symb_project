Telavancin is approved in the United States and Canada for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) in adults caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms. The antimicrobial activity of telavancin and comparators was evaluated against 5,027 (2007-2008) Gram-positive bacteria responsible for SSSI in medical centers in Asia-Pacific, European, Latin American, and North American regions. Telavancin was active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l). telavancin inhibited all Enterococcus faecalis, including four strains displaying a VanB phenotype, at </= 1 mg/L (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.25/0.5 mg/l), except for two isolates with a VanA phenotype (MIC, >2 mg/l). Vancomycin-susceptible and VanB vancomycin-resistant E. faecium were inhibited by telavancin at </= 0.25 mg/L, while this drug exhibited elevated MIC values (>/= 0.5 mg/l) against E. faecium of VanA phenotype (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 2/>2 mg/l). Telavancin was potent against beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and viridans group streptococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible). These in vitro data document the activity of telavancin against contemporary Gram-positive isolates and support its clinical use for the treatment of cSSSI caused by the indicated pathogens.
