In chronic wounds (ulcus cruris) of lymphedematous patients (n = 25) opportunistic infections caused by gram-negative rods and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus can be detected in 35% of cases. The healing of the wound takes a long time, which is the reason why the patients are taught how to manage the wound care. Local antibiotics must be avoided. The elimination of the wound infections is the first step of the complex decongestive physiotherapy. The infection aggravates the lymphostasis and makes the complaints of the patients (inflammation, pain, odor) more unacceptable, the systemic infections (erysipelas, lymphadenopathy, fever) more probable and the costs of the treatment higher. Betadine solution and ointment were used locally. The clinical and bacteriological efficacy of povidone-iodine has been validated. Excellent local tolerability has also been observed. The opinion of the patients was registered on a visual analog scale and statistically analyzed. No development of resistance has been noted. For local treatment, Betadine proved to be an effective preparation tolerable for a long time in the treatment of chronic wounds.
