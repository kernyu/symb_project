Analysis of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (c-MRSA) from Germany producing the Panton-Valentine leukocidin revealed a unique SmaI-macrorestriction pattern, different from epidemic nosocomial strains. This molecular pattern corresponds to those shown in c-MRSA strains from other countries in the European Union. All isolates exhibited resistance to fusidic acid, which is coded by the far-1 gene. From data on geographical dissemination and time of occurrence, this strain appears to have emerged in Germany in the second half of 2002, and so an already wider dissemination is likely. The emergence of MRSA with resistance to fusidic acid is a first sign of the emergence of a PVL-positive MRSA clone.
