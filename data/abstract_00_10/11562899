Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of nosocomial infections and is responsible for many community-acquired infections. Of concern is the increase in resistance to oxacillin (methicillin), with rates as high as 60% in some countries and in some intensive care units. Most of these strains are resistant to other antibacterials. Lately, strains with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides have been reported.
