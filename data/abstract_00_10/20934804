Biliverdin reductase (BVR) converts biliverdin to bilirubin. Additionally, acting as a transcription factor and possessing a capacity of a serine/threonine kinase, it may modulate signaling pathways. In order to gain better understanding of BVR functions, we used genetically modified line of mouse fibroblasts with reversible overexpression of BVR. Current study revealed that enhanced activity of BVR may protect cells in stressful conditions arising from anti-cancer drugs, cisplatin and doxorubicin, the effect most probably related to PKC alpha/beta activity, as its inhibition reversed BVR action. Therefore activity of BVR may be of significance in tumors and may influence the effectiveness of therapies.
