BACKGROUND: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is currently the first choice for empiric therapy of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. In areas where resistance to TMP/SMX is known to be high, ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are recommended as first-line choices for the empiric therapy of UTI. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the efficacy and safety profile of once-daily extended-release ciprofloxacin 500 mg (referred to hereafter as ciprofloxacin QD) with those of conventional ciprofloxacin 250 mg BID, each administered orally for 3 days, in the treatment of uncomplicated UTI in women. METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, Phase III trial, adult women with clinical signs and symptoms of acute uncomplicated UTI, pyuria, and a positive pretherapy urine culture (>/=10(5) colony-forming units/mL) received ciprofloxacin QD or ciprofloxacin BID. Bacteriologic and clinical outcomes were assessed at the test-of-cure visit (4-11 days after completion of therapy) and the late follow-up visit (25-50 days after completion of therapy). RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population consisted of 891 patients (444 ciprofloxacin QD, 447 ciprofloxacin BID); 422 patients were evaluable for efficacy (199 ciprofloxacin QD, 223 ciprofloxacin BID). At the test-of-cure visit, bacteriologic eradication was achieved in 94.5% (188/199) of the ciprofloxacin QD group and 93.7% (209/223) of the ciprofloxacin BID group (95% CI, -3.5 to 5.1). Clinical cure was achieved in 95.5% (189/198) of the ciprofloxacin QD group and 92.7% (204/220) of the ciprofloxacin BID group (95% CI, -1.6 to 7.1). Bacteriologic and clinical outcomes at the late follow-up visit were consistent with the test-of-cure findings. The rate of eradication of Escherichia coli, the most prevalent organism, was >97% in each treatment group. Rates of drug-related adverse events were similar with the once- and twice-daily ciprofloxacin regimens (10% and 9%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Extended-release ciprofloxacin 500 mg given once daily for 3 days was as effective and well tolerated as conventional ciprofloxacin 250 mg given twice daily for 3 days in the treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI in women.
