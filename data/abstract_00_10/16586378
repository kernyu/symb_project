Outbreaks of invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection within families are unusual. We investigated 2 family clusters of invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, including 1 in which a young mother died of fulminant pneumonia. Although surveillance via culture of family contacts of patients with invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is not currently recommended, such clusters should stimulate reevaluation of preventive measures.
