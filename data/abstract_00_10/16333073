To better understand the emergence and transmission of antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus agalactiae, we compared phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of 52 human and 83 bovine S. agalactiae isolates. Serotypes found among isolates from human hosts included V (48.1%), III (19.2%), Ia and Ib (13.5% each), and II (5.8%). Among isolates from bovine hosts, molecular serotypes III and II were predominant (53 and 14.5%, respectively). Four and 21 different ribotypes were found among human and bovine isolates, respectively. A combination of ribotyping and serotyping showed that two bovine isolates were indistinguishable from human isolates. Resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin was more common among human (84.6% and 26.9%, respectively) than bovine (14.5% and 3.6%, respectively) isolates. tetM was found in all tetracycline-resistant human isolates, while tetO was the predominant resistance gene among bovine isolates. tet genes were found among various ribotypes. ermB, ermTR, and mefA were detected among erythromycin-resistant human isolates, while ermB was the only erythromycin resistance determinant among isolates from bovine hosts. For isolates from human hosts, erythromycin resistance genes appeared to be associated with specific ribotypes. We conclude that (i) human and bovine S. agalactiae isolates represent distinct populations; (ii) human host-associated S. agalactiae subtypes may occasionally be transmitted to bovines; (iii) while emergence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance appears to largely occur independently among human and bovine isolates, occasional cross-species transfer of resistant strains or transmission of resistance genes between human- and bovine-associated subtypes may occur; and (iv) dissemination of antibiotic-resistant S. agalactiae appears to include both clonal spread of resistant strains as well as horizontal gene transfer.
