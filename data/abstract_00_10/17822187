The largest TB control programme in terms of patients treated is India's Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP). The treatment success of new smear positive TB cases under RNTCP has exceeded the global benchmark of 85%. Also there are some challenges in TB control programme eg, addressing TB in HIV-infected persons and accurate diagnosis and management of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB). Diagnosis of MDR-TB requires sophisticated laboratories. If MDR-TB is not managed effectively, then there is possibility to emerge drug-resistant TB which is virtually untreatable. The Public-Private mix initiatives of RNTCP attempt to make quality assured treatment for TB for all patients, regardless of healthcare providers they choose. The International Standards of TB Care (ISTC) is an international effort which has articulated the diagnostic, treatment and public health standards which all providers should hold themselves and their peers accountable to. For providers the path to practise the ISTC is to diagnose and treat patients in collaboration with RNTCP. The IMA has taken up the cause of TB control in India very seriously. This organisation of the doctors (IMA) deserves recognition for becoming the first professional association to endorse the ISTC in India. All health providers should work with and support the RNTCP, so that the programme can be made into a genuine mass movement to fight TB.
