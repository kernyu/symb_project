Colistin heteroresistance has been reported among Acinetobacter isolates; however, its association with prior colistin therapy has not been not described. A population analysis profile identified resistant Acinetobacter subpopulations from colistin-susceptible clinical isolates. The proportion of cells exhibiting heteroresistance was significantly higher among isolates recovered from patients treated with colistin.
