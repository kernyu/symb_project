Enterococcus faecalis is the most common of the Enterococcus genus causing infection, particularly urinary tract infections, worldwide. It is also a common cause of nosocomial infections and resistance to various antibiotics is on the increase worldwide. Thirty-five strains of E. Faecalis isolated from various clinical specimens (blood, wound swabs endocervical swabs but mostly urine) were screened for high-level aminoglycoside resistance. Their susceptibility nine antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin, streptomycin, vancomycin, tetracycline cotrimoxazole and chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and erthromycin) was also determined. All isolates were susceptible to Ampicillin and Vancomycin with MIC90 of 4microg/ml but resistant to Nalidixic acid with an MIC90>256microg/ml. Four (11%) of the isolates showed high-level resistance to Gentamicin while 11(32%) exhibited high-level resistance streptomycin after 24 hours incubation. It will appear that Ampicillin in combination with gentamicin but not streptomycin, can still be used empirically for the treatment of Enterococcal infections.
