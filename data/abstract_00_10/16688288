Voriconazole is a second-generation triazole derived from fluconazole but with greater potency and spectrum of activity, showing good in vitro activity against Candida, Cryptococcus and Aspergillus species, and other filamentous and dimorphic fungi. It can be administered orally or intravenously. It was initially approved in 2002 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a treatment option for invasive aspergillosis and Fusarium and S. apiospermum infections showing resistance or intolerance to other antifungals; later on, it also received approval in the United States and Europe as a treatment option for esophageal candidiasis; candida infection in non-neutropenic patients; disseminated candidiasis of skin, abdomen, kidney and bladder; and injuries. Recently, the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute established some provisional break points for voriconazole, classifying isolates with an MIC<or=1 mg/l as susceptible, those with a 2 mg/l MIC as susceptible-dose dependent, and those with an MIC>or=4 mg/l as resistant. In line with these new data, we performed a systematic review of literature on in vitro activity of voriconazole against yeast and algae isolates, and compared it to that of fluconazole and itraconazole. The review included a total of 27,340 yeast isolates, 24,177 of Candida species, 2,726 of Cryptococcus species, 453 of other species, and 104 Prototheca. The yeast isolates resistant to voriconazole is approximately 1%, and 71% of fluconazole-resistant isolates are susceptible to voriconazole.
