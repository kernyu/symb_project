The use of phenylethynylpyrene excimer forming pair in the design of specific fluorescent probes for determination of A2144G (A2143G and/or A2143C) mutations in 23S rRNA gene of Helicobacter pylori is described. Analysis of fluorescence spectra of model duplexes revealed optimal positions of fluorophore residues in the probe sequences for maximum efficiency of SNP detection. Application of excimer forming probes for analysis of DNA samples isolated from natural bacterial strains of H. pylori was demonstrated.
