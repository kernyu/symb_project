Chronic hepatitis B infection is frequently diagnosed within the genitourinary clinic setting with sexual transmission the commonest route of acquisition in the United Kingdom. Only 3--5% of adults who contract acute hepatitis B will progress to chronic infection, and these individuals can be identified by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the bloodstream 6 months after infection. Individuals at highest risk of long-term complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, carry HBeAg and have high levels of circulating hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Therapy should be targeted towards this group of patients. Two forms of therapy are now licensed for use in chronic hepatitis B infection: interferon-alpha and lamivudine. Seroconversion occurs in 30--40% of patients treated with interferon and treatment is often limited by toxicity. Lamivudine is well tolerated with seroconversion rates of 15--20% at one year, rising with increasing duration of therapy. Long-term monotherapy is limited however by the development of resistance mutations and combination nucleoside therapy is likely to become the treatment of choice in the future. Patients with chronic hepatitis B should be counselled regarding transmission, partner vaccination and alcohol intake and co-infection with other hepatitis viruses should be excluded.
