The present study performed in Spain was designed to investigate the occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococci in faecal and bulk tank milk samples from 222 healthy Murciano-Granadina dairy goats reared on 12 farms. Enterococci were isolated in 54.5% and 63.6% of the faecal and bulk tank milk samples, respectively. Enterococci were detected more frequently from goat kids (70%) than from replacement animals (44.4%) and adults (56.4%). Seven species were found in the faecal samples but the most common species detected were Enterococcus faecium (32.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (27.6%) and Enterococcus hiriae (22%). In contrast, only E. faecium and E. faecalis were found in the bulk tank milk samples. According to NCCLS (2002), of the 134 strains studied, 17 (12.7%) were resistant to at least 7 antimicrobials and 14 of these strains were resistant to vancomycin.
