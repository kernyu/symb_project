BACKGROUND: Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys-LT) can constrict small and large vessels and increase vascular permeability. Formation of cys-LT arising from polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) and endothelial cell cooperation (transcellular synthesis) led to the hypothesis that PMNL-endothelial cell adhesion may represent a key step toward the formation of vasoactive cys-LT. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the effect of pretreatment with a monoclonal antibody directed against the CD18 subunit of PMNL beta(2)-integrin on the synthesis of cys-LT in a PMNL-perfused isolated rabbit heart in vitro and in a model of permanent ligature of the left descending coronary artery in the rabbit in vivo. Challenge of PMNL-perfused rabbit hearts with formyl-met-leu-phe (0.3 micromol/L) caused synthesis of cys-LT and increase in coronary perfusion pressure that were prevented by the anti-CD18 antibody. Similar results were obtained with the use of A-23187 (0.5 micromol/L) as a challenge. Persistence of PMNL-associated myeloperoxidase activity in the perfusion buffer was observed in the presence of the anti-CD18 antibody, indicating decreased PMNL infiltration. Coronary artery ligature in vivo increased urinary excretion of leukotriene E(4), supporting the activation of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway during experimental acute myocardial infarction. Pretreatment with the anti-CD18 antibody (1 mg/kg) prevented the increase in leukotriene E(4) excretion. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the importance of adhesion in promoting cys-LT formation, originating from PMNL-endothelial cell cooperation, and contributing to myocardial stiffness and increased coronary resistance.
