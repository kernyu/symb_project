A novel phenotypic anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance assay is described. Three drugs at concentrations equivalent to those determined in in vivo pharmacokinetics, were mixed in a well, serially diluted by 10-folds, and added to incubations of clinical HIV-1 isolates and CCR-5 expressing HeLa/CD4+ cells which was previously reported as the MAGIC-5 cells (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 45 (2001) 495) to determine the 95% inhibitory dilution (ID(95)) of the combination regimens. The ID(95) of efavirenz (EFV)-containing regimens was ten-times lower than that of nevirapine (NVP)-containing regimens against HIV-1 isolated from antiviral therapy naive patients. However, the difference was not apparent by the conventional fold resistance measurement based on the 50% inhibitory concentration. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of drug combinations against clinical HIV-1 isolates can be evaluated by our assay. The ID(95)s of EFV- and nelfinavir (NFV)- containing regimens against HIV-1 from naive patients were less than 0.01 whereas those against resistant viruses were over 0.05, although the clinical cut-off values are to be determined in larger clinical studies. Our assay, designated "All-in-One Assay", that can examine resistance to three drugs simultaneously under consideration of in vivo drug concentrations described above might be useful in practice.
