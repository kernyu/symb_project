Ecthyma gangrenosum (EG) manifests as a skin lesion and is commonly associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia in immunocompromised patients. Other viral, fungal and bacterial agents can also cause EG. The first clinical observation is grouped vesicles with surrounding erythema. Within a few days, they evolve into a gangrenous ulcer with a black/gray eschar surrounded by an erythematous halo. Herein, we present a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who developed EG-like lesions due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection while he was in the intensive care unit.
