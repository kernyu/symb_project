BACKGROUND: We investigated pneumococcal susceptibility to meropenem in isolates from a tertiary children's hospital where pneumococci are commonly resistant to penicillin and cefotaxime. METHODS: From July 1998 to August 1999, meropenem susceptibilities were determined by E-test for all Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from blood or cerebrospinal fluid and for penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococcal isolates from other sites. RESULTS: Isolates that were penicillin-susceptible or penicillin-intermediate were all susceptible to meropenem. Of 29 penicillin-resistant isolates, 27 were nonsusceptible to meropenem (13 intermediate, 14 resistant). Cefotaxime-susceptible isolates were all susceptible to meropenem. Of 11 cefotaxime-intermediate isolates, 10 were nonsusceptible to meropenem (9 intermediate, 1 resistant). Of 20 cefotaxime-resistant isolates, 17 were nonsusceptible to meropenem (4 intermediate, 13 resistant). CONCLUSIONS: Meropenem resistance is common among pneumococci with decreased susceptibility to penicillin or cefotaxime. The role of this agent in the treatment of invasive infections caused by pneumococci that are resistant to penicillin and cefotaxime may be limited.
