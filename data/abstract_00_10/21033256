BACKGROUND/AIMS: Intra-arterial injection therapy is performed to ensure more localized administration; however, this approach has led to more cases of catheter obstruction during the course of treatment for pancreatic cancer than in any other type of cancer. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to verify the resistance of catheters to gemcitabine. METHODOLOGY: The catheters were prepared by injecting gemcitabine into the lumen, which was subsequently closed by clipping both ends. After incubation, the gemcitabine in the lumen of the catheter was removed, the breaking strength was measured by pulling 1 side of the catheter at a speed of 500 mm/min to test the tensile strength. To verify the surface of the lumen, the lumen was observed with an electron microscope. RESULTS: Soaking the lumen revealed no significant differences in breaking strength due to abusive treatment conditions. Electron microscopy revealed residual microscopic amounts of gemcitabine in the lumen but with no marked deterioration or alteration in the quality of the tube surface. CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine had no chemical effect on the intra-arterial injection catheter. It is possible that a thrombotic tendency in pancreatic cancer patients may be responsible for the high frequency of catheter occlusion in patients with this disease.
