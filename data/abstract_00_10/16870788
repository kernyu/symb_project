A sixth gene cassette containing a dfrB-type gene, dfrB6, was found in a dfrB6-aadA1 cassette array in class 1 integrons. This array was isolated from several multiply antibiotic-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis strains that appear to be clonally related. The DfrB6 dihydrofolate reductase conferred resistance to trimethoprim.
