Long-term lamivudine (LMV) treatment of chronic hepatitis B almost inevitably engenders viral resistance. Mutations that result in the replacement of the methionine at position 204 of the deoxynucleoside triphosphate-binding site of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) reverse transcriptase (rt) by isoleucine, valine, or (rarely) serine (rtM204I/V/S) confer high-level resistance to LMV but reduce replication efficiency. The subsequent selection or coselection of secondary mutations that partially restore replication efficiency is common and may influence drug resistance. Genotyping has shown that LMV treatment can select for HBV rtL80V/I mutants, but their prevalence and phenotype have not been documented. Analysis of a large sequence database revealed that rtL80V/I occurred almost exclusively in association with LMV resistance, and 85% of these isolates encoded rtL80I. Coselection of rtL80V/I occurred in 46% of isolates in which LMV resistance was attributable to rtM204I but only 9% of those in which resistance was attributable to rtM204V. Moreover, rtL80V/I did not occur in HBV genotype A isolates but occurred at similar frequencies in genotype B, C, and D isolates. In vitro phenotyping showed that although the rtL80I mutant by itself replicated less efficiently and was hypersensitive to LMV compared to the replication efficiency and sensitivity of its wild-type parent, the presence of rtL80I enhanced the replication efficiency of rt204I/V mutants without significantly affecting LMV resistance. Molecular modeling revealed that rt80 does not interact directly with the enzyme's substrates. Collectively, these results suggest that coselection of rtL80V/I and rtM204I/V occurs because the former compensates for the loss of replication efficiency associated with the acquisition of LMV resistance, particularly in the case of rtM204I.
