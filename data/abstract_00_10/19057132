A total of 230 Salmonella isolates representing 33 serotypes originated from food (pork, beef, chicken meat, duck meat, and shrimp), domestic animals (pig, chicken, and duck), and human (children with diarrhea) in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam were examined for the antimicrobial resistance to 10 antibiotics. Of the 230 Salmonella isolates examined, 49 (21.3%) showed antimicrobial resistance. Thirty-eight isolates (16.5%) were resistant to oxytetracycline, 26 (11.3%) to chloramphenicol, 17 (7.4%) to nalidixic acid, 16 (7.0%) to streptomycin, 5 (2.2%) to kanamycin, and 4 (1.7%) to ampicillin. No isolate showed resistance to gentamicin, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin. Among the resistant isolates, nineteen isolates were resistant to one antimicrobial agent, 10 to two, 15 to three, 3 to four, and 2 to five antimicrobial agents. The resistance rate of Salmonella isolates from the Mekong Delta, Vietnam to these antimicrobial agents seems to be relatively lower than the results of developed countries and even those of the neighboring countries.
