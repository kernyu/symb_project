The corrosion of dental alloys has biological, functional, and aesthetic consequences. Various studies have shown that protein solutions can inhibit the corrosion of alloys. This study is planned to determine the relationship of organic constituents of saliva and the corrosion of dental alloys. The organic constituents are IgA, mucine, urea, and lysozyme which are encountered in the highest amounts in saliva and the dental materials are titanium (Ti), Co-Cr-Mo and Ni-Cr-Mo alloys, and dental amalgam, the most often used metallic components in dentistry. In particular, the interactions between the commonest salivary proteins, IgA, mucine, urea and lysozyme, and Ti, Co-Cr-Mo, Ni-Cr-Mo and dental amalgam were investigated. Each alloy was evaluated by cyclic polarization in each medium. The general anodic and cathodic behavior during forward and reverse cycles, the corrosion and passivation current densities (muA/cm2 ), and the corrosion and the pitting potentials (mV) were determined. The results have shown that Ni-Cr-Mo and dental amalgam alloys are highly susceptible to corrosion in all the investigated media. The Co-Cr-Mo alloy has shown high passive current densities in the solution of mucine and lysozyme in artificial saliva. Titanium instead, has shown a high resistance to corrosion and a stable passive behavior in all media, especially in a solution of mucine and IgA in synthetic saliva. Mucine and IgA, as well as urea and lysozyme, appeared to enhance the formation of a passive film layer on the Ti metal surface, thus inhibiting the corrosion. Based on the study findings, and especially considering the problem of nickel allergy and toxicity of mercury released from dental amalgam, the use of Co-Cr-Mo alloys and Ti to Ni-Cr-Mo alloys is recommended and alternatives to dental amalgam should be sought for patients with impaired salivary flow.
