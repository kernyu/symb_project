Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem in human medicine, and concern has been expressed that use of antimicrobials in animals may be a contributing factor. Although the majority of human pathogens showing antibiotic resistance have no link with animals, the issue of animal use of antimicrobials remains controversial, particularly with respect to antibiotic growth promoters (AGP). The European Union (EU) has withdrawn as AGP some compounds that remain in use in the United Sates. This difference in availability allows comparisons to be made of antimicrobial resistance outcomes with and without use of an AGP. Such comparisons so far show little apparent measurable benefit to human health resulting from the EU removal of AGP, and there is evidence of increased use of therapeutic antibiotics in animals to treat an apparent increased incidence of clinical disease. Microbial risk assessments are important in judging quantitatively or qualitatively whether the risk of using a particular AGP is acceptable in terms of potential hazard to human health. Resistance surveillance is an essential part of such microbial risk assessments, but such surveillance should be carefully planned to avoid confounding factors that could invalidate any conclusions.
