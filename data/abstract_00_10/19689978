OBJECTIVES: In the pursuit of developing a second-generation oxazolidinone, we have identified OCID0050 as a novel oxazolidinone with enhanced activity against bacterial strains resistant to methicillin, vancomycin and linezolid. METHODS: MIC and MBC determinations were performed according to CLSI guidelines. Linezolid-resistant bacterial strains were generated in-house; inoculum effect, pH effect and kill kinetics experiments were performed as per standard protocols. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: OCID0050 demonstrated better inhibitory potency against many of the tested clinically significant strains by generally showing 2-4-fold lower MICs than linezolid. In addition, it has higher inhibitory activity against linezolid-resistant strains.
