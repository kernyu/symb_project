Linezolid, an oxazolidinone that acts by inhibiting protein synthesis, was evaluated in strains of tuberculosis and non-tubercular mycobacteria resistant to one or more drugs isolated in northern Sardinia. The in vitro activity of Linezolid (Pfizer) was assessed on different isolates of Mycobacterium spp. from clinical samples by the Proportional Method. Linezolid demonstrated an excellent activity against the 24 strains of M. tuberculosis and against M. gordonae, M. marinum, M. aurum, M. phlei, and M. avium, with MIC values ranging from 0.5 to 2 microg/ml. Linezolid can be used in combination with the standard antitubercular medications, or as an effective therapeutic alternative in infections caused by M. tuberculosis or by other species of non-tubercular mycobacteria.
