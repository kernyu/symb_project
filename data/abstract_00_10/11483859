Although apoptosis-dependent involution of malignant tumors is associated with a number of non-surgical treatments including chemotherapy, most solid tumors, including gastric cancers, respond poorly to these therapies. In the hope of overcoming the resistance mechanism against non-surgical therapies, we studied the apoptosis-resistance mechanism in cells of gastric cancers as a model system. During the course of our study on apoptotic machinery in human gastric cancer cell lines, we previously found a rapid and efficient induction of apoptosis by sorbitol. In the present study, we demonstrated that the down-regulation of PKC activity in response to sorbitol is a major factor in the induction of apoptotic cell death in gastric cancer cells.
