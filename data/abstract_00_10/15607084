The objective of this study was to determine the susceptibility of Mycoplasma bovis against six antibiotics using the E test methodology. Fifty-eight isolates of M. bovis originating from 55 affected cattle were evaluated. Specimen originated from: lung tissue, synovial fluid, tracheo-bronchial wash, milk, and external or inner ear discharge. Antimicrobial agents tested were azythromycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, enrofloxacin, spectinomycin and tetracycline. The E test strips were placed on the surface of Hayflick plates on which organism suspension was spread. Plates were incubated at 35 degrees C in a candle jar for 72 h. MICs were then read by determining where the growth inhibition zone intersected with the MIC scale on the strip. M. bovis Donetta isolate was used as a control. All MICs were >256 microg/ml for erythromycin. MIC50 and MIC90 obtained for azythromycin were 3 and >256 microg/ml, respectively. MIC50 and MIC90 obtained for tetracycline were 4 and 8 microg/ml, respectively. MIC50 and MIC90 obtained for spectinomycin were 2 and >1021 microg/ml, respectively. MIC50 and MIC90 obtained for clindamycin were 0.19 and >256 microg/ml, respectively. MIC50 and MIC90 obtained for enrofloxacin were 0.19 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. Resistance was not associated with the specimen source except for azythromycin. M. bovis susceptibilities were easily determined by the E test which demonstrated the efficacy of enrofloxacin and the acquired resistance to tetracycline, spectinomycin, azythromycin and clindamycin.
