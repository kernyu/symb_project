Assessment of 1177 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) resistance genotypes at an HIV/AIDS clinic showed a decrease in the incidence of the K65R mutation, from 15.2% of isolates during the period 2002-2004 to 2.7% of isolates during the period 2005-2006 (P < .001), despite elevated and stable rates of tenofovir use. A reduction in the rate of coadministration of didanosine (from 41.6% of patients in 2004 to 0.8% of patients in 2006; P < .001) largely explained this observation.
