A novel oxindole was discovered as an HIV non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor via HTS using a cell-based assay. Systematic structural modifications were carried out to establish its SAR. These modifications led to the identification of oxindoles with low nanomolar potency for inhibiting HIV replication. These novel and potent oxindoles could serve as advanced leads for further optimizations.
