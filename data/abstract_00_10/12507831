Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. are important clinical pathogens that frequently exhibit resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. In Enterobacter spp. strains, resistance is usually due to derepression of the Amp C locus, whereas plasmid-encoded extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are primarily responsible for resistance in Klebsiella spp. Here we report the results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program concerning the rates and trends of resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactams and other antimicrobial agents in Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. isolated between 1997 and 2000 in participating hospitals in the United States. Among Enterobacter spp., resistance (MIC>or=32 mg/l) to aztreonam, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone ranged from 12.3 to 21.2% over the 4 years, whereas resistance in Klebsiella (MIC>or=2 mg/l) ranged from 5.9 to 6.8%. There was no trend toward increased resistance to these beta-lactam agents over the monitored period. Carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) and cefepime had excellent activity against both ceftazidime-susceptible and -resistant Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. (>99% susceptible), although the minimum inhibitory concentration values of cefepime were higher in ceftazidime-resistant isolates compared with ceftazidime-susceptible isolates. Co-resistance to other antimicrobial agents was common in both tested genus groups.
