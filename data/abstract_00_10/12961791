Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common childhood conditions for which antibiotics are prescribed, often unnecessarily. Current medical literature focuses on the treatment of AOM, appropriate antibiotics, and antibiotic resistance. Placing more emphasis on examination and description of the tympanic membrane (TM) reduces the over-diagnosing of AOM and concerns associated with antibiotic use. A thorough examination of the ear must be performed in order to make an accurate diagnosis. This article presents a three-step technique to assist providers to perform pneumatic otoscopy, visualize the TM, describe their findings, and subsequently treat AOM.
