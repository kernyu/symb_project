A Tn551 insertional library of Staphylococcus aureus strain ISP479 was challenged with an antimicrobial peptide (CG 117-136) derived from human neutrophil cathepsin G (CG). After repeated selection and screening of surviving colonies, a mutant was identified that expressed increased resistance to CG 117-136. Southern hybridization analysis revealed that the Tn551 insert in this mutant (SK1) was carried on a 10.6-kb EcoRI chromosomal DNA fragment. Subsequent physical mapping of this Tn551 insert revealed that it was positioned between a putative promoter sequence and the translational start codon of the cspA gene, which encodes a protein (CspA) highly similar to the major cold shock proteins CspA and CspB of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. This Tn551 insertion as well as a separate deletion-insertion mutation in cspA decreased the capacity of S. aureus to respond to the stress of cold shock and increased resistance to CG 117-136. The results indicate for the first time that a physiologic link exists between bacterial susceptibility to an antimicrobial peptide and a stress response system.
