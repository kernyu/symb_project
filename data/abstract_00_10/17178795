The in vitro activities of cloxyquin (5-chloroquinolin-8-ol) against 9 standard strains and 150 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were studied. The MICs ranged from 0.062 to 0.25 microg/ml. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 0.125 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. These indicate that cloxyquin exhibited good antituberculosis activity, even for multidrug-resistant isolates.
