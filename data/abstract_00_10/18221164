Linezolid is the first approved member of a new generation of antibiotics, the synthetic oxazolidinones, to become available, with a broad spectrum of in vitro activity against Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. It has an excellent bioavailability both intravenously and orally and a very good safety profile both in adults and in children. With regards to its antimicrobial action, linezolid has a predominantly bacteriostatic action, rather than a bacteriocidal effect and is active against Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. Linezolid is currently showing great promise for the treatment of multi-resistant Gram-positive infections, both in the community and in a hospital setting. Clinical indications so far include skin and soft tissue infections, community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia due to MRSA, VRE bacteremia and community-acquired pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. We anticipate that this new generation of antimicrobial agents will provide adequate cover in the future for infections that cause significant treatment failures so far, such as VRE- associated endocarditis, bone and joint multi-drug resistant infections and possibly central nervous system infections, both in adult and children populations. Some patents on linezolid are also discussed in this review.
