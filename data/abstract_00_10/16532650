Bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas, isolated from the water of the lakes Shira and Itkul (Republic of Khakassia, Russia) were shown to contain integrons of class 1 with gene cassettes, contained in the variable segment (sized 1 and 1.3 kb), were shown. Out of three detected integrons only one integron (in P. aeruginosa) included the sulfanilamide resistance gene contained in the 3'-conservative segment. The resistance of bacteria to kanamycin and ceftazidime was not seemingly linked with the presence of integrons. On the whole, the study revealed the presence of a significant proportion (27%) of integron-positive strains among aquatic bacteria with pronounced resistance to antibiotics.
