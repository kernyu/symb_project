Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae are responsible for a variety of nosocomial infections, treatment of which is limited due to their increasing resistance to antibiotics. Some bacterial genes encoding antibiotic resistance comprise the major part of gene cassettes, most of which are associated with integrons. In this work, the carriage of class 1, 2 and 3 integrons was investigated in 191 Enterobacteriaceae isolates from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients. Class 1 integrons were found to be the most common, whereas no class 3 integrons were detected. The variable regions of 13 class 1 integrons were characterized and four types were found. Type 1 harbours only ant(3")I, type 2 harbours ant(2")I and ant(3")I, type 3 harbours aac(6')Ib and ant(3")I and type 4 lacks inserted gene cassettes.
