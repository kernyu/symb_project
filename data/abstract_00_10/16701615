The in vitro activity of 11 antimicrobials was tested against 74 recent anaerobic isolates obtained from pretreatment cultures in pediatric patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections using the CLSI M11-A-6 agar dilution method. Carbapenems, beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and metronidazole retained good activity, while all Bacteroides fragilis group species produced beta-lactamase and were penicillin resistant and 43% were either intermediately susceptible or resistant to clindamycin. Cefoxitin had moderate activity against B. fragilis but poor activity against Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and other B. fragilis group isolates.
