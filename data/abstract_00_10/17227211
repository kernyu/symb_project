The present investigation was undertaken to assess the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESbetaLs) among urinary tract infection (UTI) isolates. During 4 months in 2004, a total of 650 Enterobacteriaceae strains from UTIs was collected by five clinical microbiology laboratories located in southern Italy and the beta-lactamase production was investigated. A total of 50 of the 650 isolates were double-disk positive and suspected of producing an ESbetaL; Escherichia coli (36.0%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (32.0%) were the most common species among all ESbetaL producers. Characterization of ESbetaL determinants was carried out by the colony blot hybridization method, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing in order to identify the presence of bla (TEM), bla (SHV), bla (PER), and bla (CTX-M) determinants. The ESbetaL variants found in this study were the following: TEM-15, TEM-24, TEM-52, TEM-134, SHV-12, CTX-M-1, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-15, and PER-1. As expected, the majority of the isolates were found to be susceptible to imipenem (94%), cefepime (54%) and piperacillin-tazobactam (54%). The results of this survey show the prevalence of ESbetaL enzymes among enterobacterial pathogens causing UTIs in southern Italy.
