While the intensive virostatic combinations applied according to the conventional models (such as HAART), based only on the attacks of two HIV-1 targets, retrotranscriptase and protease, and applied in a long and continuous fashion, a) are notably toxic, b) do not correct completely the abnormal immunologic parameters, and c) are followed by particularly severe and poorly sensitive relapses in case of discontinuation, we propose to the 'AIDS treatment headquarters' to include in their failing strategy the two original features which we have included in the treatment of a cohort of a dozen patients, treatment applied at all but one AIDS stage. We attack one more HIV-1 target than the conventional protocols do, by adding inhibitors of integrase; we apply the combinations of virostatics, comprising inhibitors of the three targets, in short sequences (of 3 weeks), between which the analogues are changed inside each series. The first patient of the cohort started his treatment 8.5 years ago, and the entries of the others into it have been at random and not randomized. All patients are alive today and in excellent condition.
