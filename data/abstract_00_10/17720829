A total of 232 isolates of gram-negative bacteria were recovered from mammals, reptiles, and birds housed at Asa Zoological Park, Hiroshima prefecture, Japan. Forty-nine isolates (21.1%) showed multidrug resistance phenotypes and harbored at least one antimicrobial resistance gene. PCR and DNA sequencing identified class 1 and class 2 integrons and many beta-lactamase-encoding genes, in addition to a novel AmpC beta-lactamase gene, bla(CMY-26). Furthermore, the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr were also identified.
