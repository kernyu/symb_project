PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the in vitro susceptibilities of various fluoroquinolones (i.e., gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, tosufloxacin, and moxifloxacin) against conjunctival bacterial flora. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-six bacterial isolates were collected from the conjunctival sacs of 251 eyes of 224 patients (118 females and 106 males) ranging in age from 6 to 91 years old, who were scheduled for intraocular surgery at National Tokyo Medical Center. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by broth dilution testing. RESULTS: Of 266 isolates, 258 (97.0%) strains were gram-positive bacteria and eight (3.0%) strains were gram-negative bacteria. The MIC90 values of gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, tosufloxacin, and moxifloxacin against alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 0.39 microg/mL, 1.56 microg/mL, 0.39 microg/mL, and 0.20 microg/mL, respectively. The MIC90 values of gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, tosufloxacin, and moxifloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus were 1.56 microg/mL, 3.13 microg/mL, 0.78 microg/mL, and 0.78 microg/mL, respectively. The MIC90 values of gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, tosufloxacin, and moxifloxacin against Staphylococcus epidermidis were 1.56 microg/mL, 3.13 microg/mL, 3.13 microg/mL, and 0.78 microg/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although the clinical usefulness and efficacy of newer fluoroquinolones remains to be defined by clinical outcomes, the current study provides data for predicting relative in vivo potency among the fluoroquinolones.
