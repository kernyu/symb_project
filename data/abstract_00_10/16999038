Since existing medications are effective, easy-to-use and well tolerated, research in the treatment of helminthiasis in humans seems to be at a standstill. However this type of parasitic infection is still a major public-health concern and heavy socioeconomic burden in many countries. Despite observance of the first disturbing signs of resistance, release of new antihelminthics on the market (e.g. nitazoxanide and tribendimidine) remains slow. Treatment using drug combinations offers an alternative for therapeutic failure in some cases. Ongoing studies focusing on development of a vaccine, on adaptation of medications used in veterinary medicine or on the action of medicinal plants hold forth hope of finding effective new treatments.
