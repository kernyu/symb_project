The review presents data on the use of a single prophylactic dose of nevirapine at labor given to a mother at the onset of labor in HIV-infected women and neonatal infants within 72 hours after birth in the absence of chemoprophylaxis with antiviral agents during pregnancy. The administration of nevirapine is shown to result in the occurrence of resistance mutations, most of which can be identified only if superfine methods are applied. Whether nevirapine may be used for chemoprophylaxis of the vertical transmission of the virus in Russia is discussed.
