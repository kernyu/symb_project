The 2006 Community Summary Report from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) was published recently with the latest trends and figures on the occurrence of zoonotic infections and agents, antimicrobial resistance and foodborne outbreaks in the then 25 European Union (EU) Member States and five non-EU countries. This article seeks to expand further upon reports of human listeriosis (Listeria monocytogenes infections) and changes in the epidemiology of this disease, in order to inform of important developments as they relate to an opportunity for the establishment of a formalized listeriosis surveillance network in Europe.
