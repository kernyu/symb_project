AIM: To investigate the prevalence of tetM, tetQ, nim and bla(TEM) antimicrobial resistance genes in subgingival and tongue samples of Greek subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four subjects participated in the present study. Participants each contributed with one pooled subgingival sample from the mesiobuccal surface of the four first molars and one sample from the tongue. Samples were analysed using polymerase chain reaction for tetM, tetQ, nim and bla(TEM) genes using the primers and conditions described previously. Subjects were stratified according to periodontal status (health, gingivitis or periodontitis). Intake of any antibiotic for medical or dental reasons during the previous 12 months was also recorded (self-reported). Comparisons within and between groups were performed by applying non-parametric tests (z-test with Bonferroni corrections). RESULTS: A high prevalence of tetM, tetQ and bla(TEM) genes was detected in both tongue and subgingival samples (48.1-82.2%). No differences were observed across genes between periodontally healthy, gingivitis or periodontitis cases, and no statistical correlation was observed between the presence of the bla(TEM) gene and the intake of beta-lactams during the last 12 months (Fisher's exact test, p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the present study suggest a high prevalence of tetM, tetQ and bla(TEM), but not nim resistance genes in subgingival and tongue samples from Greek subjects.
