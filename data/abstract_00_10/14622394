Peritonitis is a frequent complication in patients with chronic renal failure on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) treatment. The aim of this study was to know the prevalence of fungal peritonitis on patients undergoing CAPD, and to determine the antifungal susceptibility pattern of the identified isolates. Samples of the peritoneal dialysis fluid from 165 patients on CAPD treatment with peritonitis manifestations were submitted to mycological study (direct microscopic examination, culture and antifungal susceptibility test). Ten Candida isolates were identified, being C. albicans and C. parapsilosis the most common species. From isolates obtained, three species (C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. guilliermondii) presented itraconazole resistance while C. glabrata was resistant to both itraconazole and ketoconazole. Aspergillus fumigatus was associated to peritonitis in three cases and Acremonium sp. in two.
