A series of novel 2-vinylchroman-4-ones, analogues of the natural products Aposphaerin A and B, were identified as potent antibiotics. Derivatives exhibit a significant activity against multiresistant strains of S. aureus, such as MRSA (methicillin resistant S. aureus). The 2-vinylchroman-4-ones were efficiently prepared by Lewis acid mediated conjugate addition of vinylmagnesium bromide to chromones.
