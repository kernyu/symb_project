The influence of kappa/beta-carrageenan from red marine alga Tichocarpus crinitus on the development of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection in Xanthi-nc tobacco leaves was studied. It was shown that the number of necrotic lesions on the leaves inoculated with the mixture of TMV (2 microg/ml) and carrageenan (1 mg/ml) was reduced by 87%, compared to the leaves inoculated with the virus only. The suppression of virus infection was also observed when leaves were treated with carrageenan 24 h before or 24 h after leaf inoculation with TMV; however, in these cases, suppression was less evident than after inoculation with the virus-polysaccharide mixture. It is supposed that the antiviral activity of carrageenan applied together with TMV may be explained by its action not only on the plant but also on the virus itself. The inhibitory effect of carrageenan pretreatment can be explained by its favorable effect on tissue resistance to infection. The suppression of this resistance by actinomycin D indicates that carrageenan functions via its action on the cell genome.
