Lysostaphin is a zinc metalloenzyme which has a specific lytic action against Staphylococcus aureus. Lysostaphin has activities of three enzymes namely, glycylglycine endopeptidase, endo-beta-N-acetyl glucosamidase and N-acteyl muramyl-L-alanine amidase. Glycylglycine endopeptidase specifically cleaves the glycine-glycine bonds, unique to the interpeptide cross-bridge of the S. aureus cell wall. Due to its unique specificity, lysostaphin could have high potential in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant staphylococcal infections. This review article presents a current understanding of the lysostaphin and its applications in therapeutic agent as a treatment against antibiotic-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections, either alone or in combination with other antibiotics.
