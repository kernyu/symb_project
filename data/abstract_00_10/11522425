A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) associated with a major nicotinic receptor subunit (i.e., alpha4) has been identified in two mouse lines that were selectively bred for differences in sensitivity to ethanol. These mice, referred to as Long-Sleep (LS) and Short-Sleep (SS) mice, also differ in sensitivity to several effects of nicotine. The potential role of the alpha4 RFLP in regulating several responses to nicotine and ethanol was evaluated by using the LSxSS-derived recombinant inbred (RI) strains. Those RI strains that carried the LS-like alpha4 RFLP were more sensitive to the depressant effects of nicotine on Y-maze crossing and rearing activities and ethanol-induced increases in Y-maze crossing activity than were those RI strains that carry the SS-like alpha4 RFLP. The LS-like RI strains were also more sensitive to nicotine-induced hypothermia. The RFLP was not associated with strain differences in ethanol-induced body temperature or sleep time. The potential role of the RFLP in regulating ethanol and nicotine consumption was evaluated in heterogeneous stock (HS) mice. An association was found between the alpha4 RFLP and variation in ethanol consumption, but not in nicotine consumption, as measured in a four-bottle choice test. Recent studies of ethanol and tobacco abuse by human beings suggest that common genes may influence these two forms of substance abuse. The results of the studies reported here suggest that the alpha4 nicotinic receptor gene should be evaluated for its potential role in regulating ethanol and tobacco abuse in human beings.
