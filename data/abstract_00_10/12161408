Fluconazole alone does not demonstrate any contact activity against resistant organisms. Phenolic antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxyanisole, appear to promote fluconazole activity resulting in the killing of 10(4) cfu/mL of 11 resistant Candida albicans strains within 3-15 min and of 10(4) cfu/mL of 10 resistant Escherichia coli strains within 6-15 min. Fluconazole activity was increased by the addition of ethyl alcohol (20%). Antioxidants appear to promote fluconazole activity by increasing cell membrane permeability. This combination has potential advantages in the administration of topical fluconazole.
