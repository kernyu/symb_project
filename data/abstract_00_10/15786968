The results of experiments on Wistar rats showed that acute poisoning with 1.0 LD50 of ethylene glycol decreased the nonspecific resistance of the organism (manifested by increased lethality caused by experimental infection, decreased average lethal dose of E. coli, and decreased mean effective lifetime of experimental animals) and reduced the antibody formation to predominantly a thymus-dependent antigen, natural and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, and delayed type hypersensitivity reaction. 4-Methylpyrazole and (to a greater extent) ethanol potentiated the immunotoxic action of ethylene glycol.
