Protein farnesyltransferase of Plasmodium falciparum is a potential target in the treatment of malaria for which increased drug resistance is observed. The design, synthesis and evaluation of a series of N-(4-piperidinyl)benzamides is reported. The most potent compounds showed in vitro activity against the parasite at submicromolar concentrations.
