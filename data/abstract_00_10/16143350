A novel forward mutation assay has been developed in Salmonella typhimurium based on resistance to 5-fluorouracil (FU). The mutational target in the FU assay was determined to be the uracil phosphoribosyl transferase (upp) gene. To validate the upp gene as a suitable target for monitoring a variety of induced mutations, the mutational specificity was determined for five mechanistically different mutagens. The mutagens included a polycyclic hydrocarbon (benzo[a]pyrene, B[a]P), SN1 and SN2 alkylating agents (N-nitroso-N-methylurea, MNU, and methyl methanesulfonate, MMS, respectively), a frameshift mutagen (ICR-191), and an oxidative-damaging agent (hydrogen peroxide, H2O2). Induced mutation frequencies were measured in the presence and absence of the plasmid pKM101 (strain FU100 and FU1535, respectively). pKM101 renders FU100 more susceptible to induced mutation by providing error-prone replicative bypass of DNA adducts. B[a]P, MMS, and H2O2 failed to induce the mutant frequency in FU1535, demonstrating the dependence of pKM101 on induced mutations with these agents. ICR-191 and MNU were not dependent on pKM101, and did significantly induce mutations in FU1535. In contrast to FU1535, all agents significantly induced mutations in FU100. Approximately 60 independent mutants were sequenced for each agent that significantly induced the mutant frequency above background. The resulting mutational spectra illustrated predictable molecular fingerprints based on known mutagenic mechanisms for each agent. The predominant mutations observed were G:C to T:A transversions for B[a]P, A:T to T:A and G:C to T:A transversions for MMS, G:C to T:A transversions and A:T frameshifts for H2O2, G:C frameshifts for ICR-191, and G:C to A:T transitions for MNU. It can be concluded that the upp gene in the FU assay is a sensitive and suitable target to monitor a variety of induced mutations in Salmonella.
