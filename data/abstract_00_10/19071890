In this study the molecular identification and susceptibility profile of 21 clinical isolates, from a Brazilian hospital, belongs to six different species of Trichosporon were described. Trichosporon asahii was the predominant species and corresponded to 43% of isolates. Eighty three percent of the strains isolated from deep sites were identified as T. asahii, while only 17% belong to a non-T. asahii species (Trichosporon inkin). In general, the MICs were high and independent of the species of Trichosporon as well as the clinical origin of strain. Amphotericin B and fluconazole were less effective against Trichosporon spp. and high MIC values of voriconazole, posaconazole and ravuconazole were observed. Fifty-six percent (5/9) of T. asahii strains were isolated from deep sites, whereas 8% (1/12) of non-T. asahii species were isolated from those sites. A total of 89% of T. asahii isolates exhibited resistance to amphotericin B in vitro.
