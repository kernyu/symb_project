Drug therapy of HIV infection has become more effective in the last years. The rates of viral suppression one year after initiation of treatment have increased, and the mean duration of the first combination therapy is now over 24 months. Nowadays, for patients with a failing regimen, in most cases a second or even third combination of drugs can achieve long term viral suppression. In comparison, the treatment of patients with drug resistances to three or more active substance classes is still a challenge that demands an individual and selective approach. Options for these patients include an intensification of therapy, maintaining a partially effective regimen, a temporary interruption in the therapy or the very careful planning of the use of new or investigational drugs. To maximize the use of new drugs, new treatment sequences should ideally include at least two new drugs. Realistically, long-term suppression of viral replication cannot be achieved in the majority of these patients; here the goal must be to optimize the clinical prognosis and to delay the progression of the HIV infection as long as possible.
