All 982 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains collected from August 2006 to December 2007 were tested for vancomycin susceptibility by using 3-microg/ml vancomycin brain heart infusion screening plates, a vancomycin Etest, and a vancomycin/teicoplanin macro Etest. Three vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) (0.3%) and two heterogeneous VISA (0.2%) isolates were identified. The screening method yielded 895 cases of < or =1 colony and 87 positive results (with growth of >1 colony after 48 h); further Etests showed 82/87 isolates with growth on screening plates to be false positive. Repeat testing showed a false-positivity rate of only 15 of the original 87 isolates by plate screening.
