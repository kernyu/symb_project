The present study demonstrates that exposure of bacteria to medium strength static magnetic fields can significantly alter antibiotic sensitivity. Cultures of Escherichia coli were exposed to fields produced by permanent magnets. Samples of bacterial cultures continuously growing in the presence and in the absence of static magnetic fields were left untreated or were treated with an antibiotic and measured at 45 min intervals for cell growth and survival. It was found that exposure of E. coli to the static fields significantly increased antibiotic resistance. Bioelectromagnetics 22:129-137, 2001. Published 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
