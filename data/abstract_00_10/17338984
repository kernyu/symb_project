The purpose of this review is to discuss the basis for ritonavir boosting of protease inhibitors as well as the complications and benefits associated with ritonavir boosting when designing an antiretroviral regimen for treatment-experienced patients. Such patients have fewer viable options because of cross-resistance arising from previous regimen failures. Ritonavir administered at a low dose to boost another protease inhibitor may be a useful strategy for achieving virological efficacy while minimizing the toxicities associated with full-dose ritonavir. There may be an increased risk of adverse events associated with increased plasma concentration of the concurrent protease inhibitor. Still, the incidence of these adverse events is generally low, and clinical trials have suggested that they rarely result in discontinuation or alteration of the regimen. In highly treatment-experienced patients in particular, the potential benefits associated with ritonavir boosting usually outweigh the risks.
