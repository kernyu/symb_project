Salmonella genomic island 1 was identified for the first time in Salmonella enterica serovar Virchow isolated from humans in Taiwan. The complex class 1 integron conferring multidrug resistance was shown to be inserted within open reading frame (ORF) S023 and contains for the first time a partial transpositional module. The 5-bp target duplication flanking the complex integron suggests that its insertion in ORF S023 was by transposition.
