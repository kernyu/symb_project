The World Health Organization's Western Pacific Region (WHO WPR) long standing programme for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, GASP, continued in 2002. Seventeen countries contributed data on about 11,500 gonococci by determining susceptibility patterns using standardised methodologies. Resistance to quinolone and penicillin antibiotics remained widely dispersed and at historically high levels. Gonococci with decreased susceptibility to third generation cephalosporins were again observed in several centres. Spectinomycin resistance was infrequently encountered. Control of gonorrhoea in the WHO WPR is compromised by the further reduction in options for cheap and effective treatment of gonorrhoea.
