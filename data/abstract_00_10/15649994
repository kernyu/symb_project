OBJECTIVES: Neutrophils play a crucial role in the control of the Aspergillus fumigatus infection and act in concert with antifungal drugs. This study was undertaken to obtain insights into the possible involvement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the interaction of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB; AmBisome) with neutrophils in response to A. fumigatus. METHODS: For generation of bone marrow-transplanted mice, irradiated C57BL6 mice were infused with T cell-depleted allogeneic donor cells. For infection, mice were injected intranasally with Aspergillus fumigatus conidia and treated with L-Amb and deoxycholate amphotericin B prophylactically or therapeutically. For TLR-dependent antifungal functions, murine neutrophils were preincubated with antifungals or TLR ligands before the addition of Aspergillus conidia. RESULTS: The results show that: (a) neutrophil activation by Aspergillus occurs through TLR signalling pathways differently affecting the oxidative and non-oxidative mechanisms of the killing machinery; (b) by diverting signalling from TLR-2 to TLR-4, liposomes of AmBisome activate neutrophils to an antifungal state while attenuating the pro-inflammatory effects of deoxycholate amphotericin B; (c) this translates in vivo to the optimization of the AmBisome therapeutic efficacy in mice with aspergillosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a putative molecular basis for the reduced infusion-related toxicity of AmBisome and suggest that TLR manipulation in vivo is amenable to the induction of optimal microbicidal activity in the absence of inflammatory cytotoxicity to host cells.
