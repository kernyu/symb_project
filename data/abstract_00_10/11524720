There is substantial evidence that the overuse of antibiotics is a major cause for the emergence of resistance in respiratory pathogens in the community. However, it is also recognized that the mechanisms of resistance, the cost of resistance to the fitness of the organism, and the ability of the resistant strain to disseminate are all important contributors to this problem. Therefore, when developing strategies to control and/or prevent the emergence of resistance, health care professionals must take each of these factors into consideration. As we enter a new era in the use of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, we have an opportunity to apply such lessons learned in the past to minimize or prevent the development of resistance to this class of antimicrobial drugs in the future.
