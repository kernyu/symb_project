To study the effect of Trastuzumab in combination with IFN alpha-2b on HER2 and MRP1 of ACHN in vitro, ACHN cell line of RCC was cultured by employing cell culture. The tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay was used to evaluate the growth-inhibiting effect of Trastuzumab with IFN alpha-2b. SP method was utilized to determine the expression of HER2 and MRP1 of the cells. Our results showed that Trastuzumab had inhibitory effect on the growth of renal tumor cells and reversing effect on the multi-drug-resistance (MDR) in RCC in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Treated with Trastuzumab with or without IFN alpha-2b, the expression of HER2 and MRP1 genes of RCC was decreased significantly (P<0.05). It was concluded that Trastuzumab with IFN alpha-2b could inhibit the proliferation of RCC and the expression of HER2 and MRP1 of ACHN and to some extent, reverse the MDR of the tumor cells.
