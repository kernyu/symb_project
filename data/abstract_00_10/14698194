A series of novel 4'-substituted 16-membered ring macrolides was synthesized by the cleavage of the mycarose sugar and subsequent modification of 4'-hydroxyl group. This new class of macrolides antibiotics is acid stable. The synthetic methodology described here is expected to find application in the synthesis of new generation of macrolides that target the emerging bacterial resistance.
