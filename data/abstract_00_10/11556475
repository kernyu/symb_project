This report presents the case of a low birth weight neonate with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter Lwoffii infection who was successfully treated with ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole. Use of ciprofloxacin in pediatric populations was reviewed. The infant responded to the antibiotic regimen with sterilized cerebrospinal fluid with no adverse effects attributable to the ciprofloxacin. Although ciprofloxacin has been found to cause irreversible damage to cartilage in laboratory animals, a review of the literature found that this complication rarely occurs in pediatric patients. Ciprofloxacin has been found to be effective in the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram negative infections in pediatric patients, including premature infants. Ciprofloxacin should be considered in the treatment of neonatal infection caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms.
