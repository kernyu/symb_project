Daptomycin has demonstrated antibacterial activity against several antibiotic-resistant strains, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci. A paucity of data exists concerning in vivo development of daptomycin resistance of enterococci. We describe an allogeneic bone marrow transplant patient, who was found to have vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus durans bacteremia, which subsequently developed resistance to daptomycin.
