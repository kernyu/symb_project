BACKGROUND: We report our experience with quinupristin/ dalfopristin in combination with a glycopeptide in the treatment of severe staphylococcal infections failing previous glycopeptide regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five patients, affected by persistent bacteremia (n = 2), post-cardiothoracic surgery infection (n = 2) and post-traumatic bone infection (n = 1) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 4) methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS, n = 1) and unsuccessfully treated with antibiotics including a glycopeptide, were treated with a quinupristin/ dalfopristin and glycopeptide combination. RESULTS: Three patients were clinically cured; one patient with MRSA thoracic aorta prosthetic infection relapsed after 3 months; one patient was lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Quinupristin/dalfopristin, in combination with a glycopeptide, is an effective treatment option for severe methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections failing previous glycopeptide regimens.
