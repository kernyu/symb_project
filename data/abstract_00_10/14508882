The incidence and severity of invasive fungal infections have significantly increased among immunocompromised hosts leading to excessive morbidity and mortality. Several preventative antifungal strategies (prophylaxis, empirical and pre-emptive) have been developed to improve the outcome of these infections. Although effective, these strategies are associated with toxicity, high cost and potential emergence of resistance. An alternative strategy, in the attempt to optimize the use of antifungal agents in preventing fungal infections, is a risk-adjusted approach based on the risk for, and severity of, infection in a given patient. This strategy has the potential to provide patients likely to suffer severe fungal infection the benefits of antifungal agents while avoiding the negative aspects (toxicity, cost and risk of resistance) in patients at low risk for these infections. In this review we focus on this strategy in cancer patients but it may also be applied to other immunocompromised hosts.
