The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of effects of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) were obtained from heparinized blood of CML patients by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. The expressions of CD1a, CD83, CD86, HLA-ABC, HLA-DR and CD54 on DC induced by IFN-alpha + GM-CSF, IFN-alpha + GM-CSF+IL-4 and IL-4 + GM-CSF for 7 days in vitro were assayed by flow cytometry. The morphologic features were observed by transmission and optical microscopy. The mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) with DC were evaluated by MTT assay. The results showed that the DC cultured in different cytokine combinations expressed significantly higher levels of CD1a, HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, CD86, CD54, and CD83 than those in the precultured. The DC growing with IFN-alpha + GM-CSF expressed significantly higher levels of HLA-ABC, HLA-DR than those in GM-CSF + IL-4. The CD86 expression and MLR levels in IFN-alpha + GM-CSF + IL-4 increased significantly. The expression rate of DC antigens and MLR in the IFN resistant group significantly lower than those in the newly diagnosed and the effectively treated groups after at least 6 months of IFN-alpha treatment (P < 0.05). The DC from the IFN resistant group did not express significantly CD86 and MLR in IFN-alpha + GM-CSF + IL-4 groups compared to those in the newly diagnosed and IFN effective treated groups. It is concluded that the BMMNC from CML cultured in combination with IFN-alpha and other cytokines can be induced into DC with typical morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics. Addition of IFN-alpha + GM-CSF + IL-4 to DC cultures can significantly up-regulate the expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules, co-stimulatory molecules and various adhesion molecules. The deficiency of DC differentiation and function may play a role in the development of clinical resistance to IFN-alpha.
