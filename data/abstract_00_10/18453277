Biofilms formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa have long been recognized as a challenge in clinical settings. Cystic fibrosis, endocarditis, device-related infections, and ventilator-associated pneumonia are some of the diseases that are considerably complicated by the formation of bacterial biofilms, which are resistant to most current antimicrobial therapies. Due to intense research efforts, our understanding of the molecular events involved in P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, maintenance, and antimicrobial resistance has advanced significantly. Over the years, several dogmas regarding these multicellular structures have emerged. However, more recent data reveal a remarkable complexity of P. aeruginosa biofilms and force investigators to continually re-evaluate previous findings. This chapter provides examples in which paradigms regarding P. aeruginosa biofilms have been challenged, reflecting the need to critically re-assess what is emerging in this rapidly growing field. In this process, several avenues of research have been opened that will ultimately provide the foundation for the development of preventative measures and therapeutic strategies to successfully treat P. aeruginosa biofilm infections.
