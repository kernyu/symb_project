E. coli remains the most often isolated pathogen in community urinary tract infections in children. We reported a retrospective study of antibiotic susceptibility of 506 E. coli strains isolated from urine. We found that 53% of the strains were resistant to amoxicilline and 22% to cotrimoxazole. The frequency of resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was of 7%, 40% of the strains were just intermediary and 53% were sensitive. Only five strains (1%) were resistant to ceftazidime: two mechanisms of resistance, hyperproduction of TEM betalactamase (3 cases) and cephalosporinase (2 cases), were suggested. This study illustrates the necessity of constant monitoring of bacterial resistance to adapt antibiotherapeutic guidelines to local evolution.
