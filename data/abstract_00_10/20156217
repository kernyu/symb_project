The aim of this study was to investigate the isolation and distribution rate of Candida spp. in blood cultures and evaluate antifungal susceptibility during an 11-year period (1998-2008) at a tertiary-care hospital. The causative species were as follows: Candida albicans, 163 strains (64%); Candida parapsilosis, 35 strains (13.7%); Candida glabrata, 25 strains (9.8%); Candida tropicalis, 19 strains (7.4%); and other Candida spp., 13 strains (5.1%). Candidaemia is predominantly caused by C. albicans. C. parapsilosis is the most common non-albicans Candida isolated in neonatal intensive-care units. All Candida isolates remain susceptible to amphotericin B, whereas the highest degree of resistance was observed for azoles.
