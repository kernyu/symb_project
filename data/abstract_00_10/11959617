We examined the in vitro activity of linezolid against Clostridium difficile, including isolates with reduced susceptibility to metronidazole or vancomycin. The MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC50) and MIC90 were 0.5 and 2 microg/ml, respectively (range, 0.03 to 4 microg/ml). MICs were always <or= 4 microg/ml, and thus, all isolates were considered susceptible.
