Since 2001, an increase in the number of MRSA strains with heteroresistance to oxacillin has been observed in the Netherlands. These strains can spread unnoticed, as their phenotypic heterogenous resistance to beta-lactams affects the results of susceptibility testing. Therefore, further testing using PBP2a latex agglutination or PCR are recommended.
