One hundred and eighteen Neisseria meningitidis isolates were recovered from patients with invasive meningococcal disease in Portugal, over one year. Our study was undertaken to evaluate antimicrobial susceptibility, serogroup, serotype and genotype of isolates. One quarter (24.6%) of the isolates showed moderate resistance to penicillin and 47.4% were resistant to sulphadiazine. The two most common serosubtypes were C:2b:P1.5,2 (31.3%) and B:4:P1.15 (3.4%). Half (53.6%) of the isolates with moderate resistance to penicillin were phenotype C:2b:P1.5,2 (n=14), C:2b:P1.2 (n=1) or C:2b:NST (n=1); Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed that all these isolates were genetically related. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis of representative clones from each PFGE pattern showed the predominance of the ST-8 complex/cluster A4 among N. meningitidis with moderate resistance to penicillin. This clonal complex has been principally found in Southern Europe. The apparent emergence and dissemination of the hypervirulent ST-8 complex/cluster A4 among serogroup C strains increases the need for a continued surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of meningococci and of genotypic markers in Portugal.
