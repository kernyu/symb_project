The emergence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin and 3rd-generation cephalosporins is a concern for physicians in developing countries. This study assessed the in vitro activity of gentamicin and amikacin against 464 S. entenca serovar Typhi isolates obtained from blood of patients clinically suspected of enteric fever who attended the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine from 1991 to 2003. The isolates were sensitive to gentamicin and amikacin, showing minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.01-4 microg/mL and 0.005-3.5 microg/mL respectively. Both agents showed bactericidal activity at concentrations of 2 microg/mL after incubation for 6 hours. Aminoglycoside antibiotics such as gentamicin and amikacin may thus be introduced as a treatment regimen for typhoid fever.
