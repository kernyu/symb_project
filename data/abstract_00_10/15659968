PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As antibiotic resistance in staphylococci continues to evolve, the ability to treat infections in children with confidence using first-generation cephalosporins, penicillins, and macrolides is decreasing. Knowledge of the local trends in resistance is important in making decisions of empiric antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic resistance pattern for the child's pathogen should be assessed whenever possible, to allow the practitioner to properly judge the risks and benefits of alternative antibiotic agents, should they be required for definitive therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Options for therapy of most methicillin-resistant and macrolide-resistant community-acquired strains of Staphylococcus aureus include vancomycin, linezolid, and, in communities with a high proportion of susceptible strains, clindamycin. Daptomycin, a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against virtually all strains of S. aureus, was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for adults. Second-generation glycopeptide antibiotics similar to vancomycin are in clinical trials in adults, including dalbavancin and oritavancin. Several new compounds, including cephalosporins active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus, are in preclinical development as well. SUMMARY: The recent worldwide emergence and rapid spread of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus has prompted a change in the approach to therapy of staphylococcal infections in both the outpatient clinic and the hospital. Newer agents active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus such as linezolid have been recently approved for children and other agents recently approved for adults are under investigation in children. Older agents for which relatively few data from prospective, controlled, comparative studies exist in the treatment of staphylococcal infections may also offer effective and less costly options for therapy.
