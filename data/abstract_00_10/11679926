Cross-resistance between zidovudine, stavudine, and lamivudine was studied, using purified recombinant reverse transcriptase from a zidovudine-susceptible and -resistant pair of clinical isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. The zidovudine-resistant isolate exhibited low-level cross-resistance to both stavudine and lamivudine in drug susceptibility assays. Enzyme from the resistant isolate demonstrated reduced inhibition by zidovudine triphosphate and stavudine triphosphate and, to a lesser extent, lamivudine triphosphate. These findings provide additional evidence at the viral and enzyme level for cross-resistance between zidovudine and stavudine, and they suggest a possible effect of zidovudine resistance on susceptibility to lamivudine.
