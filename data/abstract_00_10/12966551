Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) is a growing concern in immunocompromised individuals, such as in the transplant setting. Alone, or in concert with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), infections with HHV-6 are often severe enough to require antiviral therapy, generally in the form of ganciclovir (GCV). GCV resistance in HCMV is well documented, both clinically and in the laboratory, and has been shown to result from mutations in the UL97 protein kinase and/or UL54 DNA polymerase. GCV resistance in HHV-6 has been documented. However, to date, it has only been investigated to a limited extent. The baculovirus system has previously been shown to be useful in studying GCV resistance with respect to herpesvirus protein kinase mutations. Using the baculovirus system, we created recombinant baculoviruses expressing either a wild-type HHV-6 U69 protein kinase or a mutated form containing homologous mutations to those documented in the UL97 protein kinase of GCV resistant HCMV isolates. The recombinant baculoviruses were used to infect Sf-9 cells and cultured in the presence of GCV to determine the effect of the HHV-6 U69 protein kinase mutations on GCV susceptibility. Mutations in the HHV-6 U69 protein kinase, homologous to those in the HCMV UL97 protein kinase documented to cause GCV resistance, result in GCV resistance in the recombinant baculoviruses.
