The effects of a red wine polyphenolic extract (RWPE), ethanol, or both combined were evaluated in insulin resistant rats. Rats were fed for 6 weeks with fructose (60%)-enriched food and force-fed with (a) water only (F group), (b) aqueous solution of RWPE (100 mg/kg, FP group), (c) 10% (v/v) mixture of ethanol and water (FE group), or (d) solution containing the same amount of the RWPE and ethanol (FPE group). Animals fed a standard chow (C group) were used for comparison purpose. After 6 weeks, blood pressure was higher in F (130.0 x b1 1.7 mm Hg) than in C animals (109.6 x b1 0.9 mm Hg) and similar to the C group in all other fructose-fed treatment groups. Relative heart weight was higher in F (3.10 x b1 0.05) than in C (2.78 x b1 0.07) and significantly lower in FP (2.92 x b1 0.04) and FPE (2.87 x b1 0.08 mg/g) than in F animals. Left ventricle and aorta productions of reactive oxygen species (O2*-) were higher in F than in C groups and lowered by the RWPE but not by the ethanol treatment. Ethanol but not the RWPE treatment reduced the degree of insulin resistance in the fructose-fed rats. In summary, our study showed that polyphenols are able to prevent cardiac hypertrophy and production of reactive oxygen species in the insulin resistant fructose-fed rat.
