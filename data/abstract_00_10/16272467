Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important pathogen in the United States and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Since the introduction of the seven-valent conjugate vaccine, a significant decline in pneumococcal disease has been reported. However, surveillance for pneumococcal disease remains essential, as the extent of cross protection against vaccine-related serotypes is still unclear. Further, any increase in non-vaccine-related serotypes also needs monitoring. We report on a new clonal association between a vaccine-related serotype, serotype 23A, obtained as part of the Active Bacterial Core surveillance, with an established internationally dispersed Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network (PMEN) clone, clone Colombia(23F)-26. Sixty-two isolates of serotype 23A collected from sterile sites during a 2-year period (2002 and 2003) were characterized. Twenty-one (34%) isolates were penicillin nonsusceptible, although none were fully resistant. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing analysis showed that 24 (39%) of the serotype 23A isolates shared either genetic identity or high genetic relatedness with PMEN clone Colombia(23F)-26. Extensive variability was noted within the sequenced region of pbp2b in two penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates as well as in PMEN clone Colombia(23F)-26, suggesting that these isolates probably acquired penicillin resistance independently. The emergence of such new serotype and genotype associations highlights the dynamic nature of the pneumococcal population, necessitating continuous monitoring in the post-vaccine era.
