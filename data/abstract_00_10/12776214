The availability of genome sequences is revolutionizing the field of microbiology. Genetic methods are being modified to facilitate rapid analysis at a genome-wide level and are blossoming for human pathogens that were previously considered intractable. This revolution coincided with a growing concern about the emergence of microbial drug resistance, compelling the pharmaceutical industry to search for new antimicrobial agents. The availability of the new technologies, combined with many genetic strategies, has changed the way that researchers approach antibacterial drug discovery.
