Silver sulfadiazine 1%, mupirocin 2%, and fusidic acid 2% were compared to assess the antibacterial effect of a once-daily application on experimental rat 15% full-skin thickness burn wounds seeded 24 hours earlier with a 10 standard strain of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The quantitative counts of seeded organism in burn eschar and subjacent muscle were determined at postburn day 7, beside the cultures of blood and lung biopsies. All tested topical agents were equally effective against methicillin-resistant in reducing local burn wound bacterial count and preventing systemic infection.
