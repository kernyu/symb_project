Numerous small RNAs regulators of gene expression exist in bacteria. A large class of them binds to the RNA chaperone Hfq and act by base pairing interactions with their target mRNA, thereby affecting their translation and/or stability. They often have multiple direct targets, some of which may be regulators themselves, and production of a single sRNA can therefore affect the expression of dozens of genes. We show in this study that the synthesis of the Escherichia coli pleiotropic PhoPQ two-component system is repressed by MicA, a sigma(E)-dependent sRNA regulator of porin biogenesis. MicA directly pairs with phoPQ mRNA in the translation initiation region of phoP and presumably inhibits translation by competing with ribosome binding. Consequently, MicA downregulates several members of the PhoPQ regulon. By linking PhoPQ to sigma(E), our findings suggest that major cellular processes such as Mg(2+) transport, virulence, LPS modification or resistance to antimicrobial peptides are modulated in response to envelope stress. In addition, we found that Hfq strongly affects the expression of phoP independently of MicA, raising the possibility that even more sRNAs, which remain to be identified, could regulate PhoPQ synthesis.
