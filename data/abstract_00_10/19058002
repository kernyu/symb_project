There is increasing evidence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) resistance to the classical triple therapy consisting of a proton-pump inhibitor and clarithromycin with either amoxicillin or metronidazole. This study is aimed at establishing the efficacy and safety of a 14-day regimen to eradicate H. pylori in patients who have failed with the classical triple therapy given for 14 days. One hundred seventy-six patients diagnosed to have H. pylori infection were given triple therapy for 14 days. Fifty-two patients who failed to respond as evident from positive 14C-urea breath test (UBT) done 4-6 weeks after the completion of triple therapy were offered a combination regimen comprised of furazolidone 200 mg b.i.d, co-amoxiclav 1 g b.i.d., colloidal bismuth subcitrate 240 mg b.i.d., and esomeprazole 40 mg b.i.d. for 14 days. The mean age of these patients was 41 +/- 13 years (range 20-67). Thirty-four were males. To document eradication of H. pylori, UBT was repeated 4 weeks after the completion of treatment. On an intention-to-treat analysis, the eradication rate was 81% (42 out of 52) whereas on per-protocol basis, the eradication rate was 82.4% (42 out of 51). In conclusion, this new regimen represents a suitable second-line therapy.
