A retrospective survey was conducted at Bicetre Hospital, France from January 2001 to September 2003 to screen for S. aureus isolates with a typical phenotype previously involved in necrotizing pneumonia in France. They were resistant to oxacillin and kanamycin, of intermediate susceptibility to fusidic acid, and susceptible to tobramycin and fluoroquinolones. Seventeen isolates were found and 16 were viable. The Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes, various toxin genes and SCCmec IV and agr3 alleles were detected in all isolates. The clonal origin of these isolates was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Fourteen isolates were community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (CA-MRSA) isolated from previously healthy patients with skin or soft tissue infections. Three infections were of nosocomial origin, underlining that these PVL-producing CA-MRSA strains may also be hospital acquired. Five CA-MRSA isolates with an identical resistance phenotype collected in a neighbouring teaching hospital (Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France) were also PVL positive. Three isolates were clonally related to those of the Bicetre Hospital whereas two were not. This retrospective study identified PVL-producing CA-MRSA in two Parisian hospitals. The incidence at Bicetre Hospital was 0.8% of all S. aureus and 2% of all MRSA isolated. Our data indicate that these MRSA isolates might become hospital acquired.
