Insulin resistance on porcine granulosa cells was induced by wortmannin, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor, and insulin signaling key molecules were investigated including glut(4) and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Granulosa insulin resistance decreased glut(4) expression but increased mitogen-activated protein kinase, indicating the cross talk between the metabolic and mitogenic pathways of insulin signaling in the ovary.
