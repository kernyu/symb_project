The increasing prevalence of resistance to penicillin and other drugs among pneumococci has considerably complicated the empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Penicillin resistance has become widespread and is a worldwide occurrence. Resistance to other classes of antibiotics traditionally used as alternatives in the treatment of pneumococcal infections has also increased markedly during recent years. In some areas of the USA, Europe, and east Asia a prevalence of macrolide resistance as high as 35% or more has been reported recently. From the clinical standpoint, a growing number of failures following the use of these agents has been described. Resistance to fluoroquinolones remains low but several failures have been reported in different parts of the world. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters have become essential at the time of making a rational choice and calculation of dosage. Penicillin G remains the mainstay of therapy for the treatment of penicillin-susceptible pneumococcal pneumonia. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal pneumonia (minimum inhibitory concentration <4 microg/mL) can be safely treated with adequate betalactams at the right dosage. The new fluoroquinolones are very active and effective in pneumococcal pneumonia. Caution should be exercised in the widespread prescription of these drugs if we are to limit the rate of resistance to these agents.
