A questionnaire survey on the theory of postoperative infection prophylaxis was conducted to obtain the consensus on perioperative antimicrobial use among urologists in Japan in the period from April to July 2000. Sixty-three of the 87 urologists replied, and the following consensus was obtained. An antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) agent should be chosen based on their efficacy against the pathogens expected to be contaminants, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacteroides fragilis group. Use an AMP agent that achieves a bactericidal concentrations in both the serum and operating site. Use an AMP agent that has little unfavourable side effects. The newer agents should be considered as a therapeutics for postoperative infections. The therapeutic antimicrobial agents having no cross-resistance to the AMP agents should be used, if postoperative infection is suspected or developed. The most commonly used agent for clean operations are cefazolin (CEZ), followed by cefotiam (CTM) and piperacillin (PIPC), in this order. For clean-contaminated operations, the most commonly used agent is CTM, followed by PIPC and CEZ.
