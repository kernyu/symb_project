Out of 175 pneumococcal isolates from middle ear fluids, 26.3% were penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP). Serotypes 19F and 23F occurred most frequently among PRSP strains. The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) showed better coverage of PRSP strains (87.0%). The 7-valent PCV may reduce the prevalence of PRSP in Japan.
