BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that the Helicobacter pylori eradication rate in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia is lower when compared to patients with peptic ulcer diseases. AIM: The aim of this study was to study the efficacy of triple therapy for H. pylori infection in patients with duodenal ulcer vs. patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia. METHODS: A total of 582 Chinese patients with proven H. pylori infection were recruited to receive: omeprazole 20 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg and clarithromycin 500 mg all given twice daily for 7 days (OCA regime). Endoscopy with rapid urease test, histology and culture were performed before treatment. Post-treatment H. pylori status was determined by (13)C-urea breath test. Metronidazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin resistance was defined as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of >8 microg/mL, >1 microg/mL and >1 microg/mL, respectively. RESULTS: A significantly higher (intention-to-treat/per-protocol) eradication rate was found in patients with duodenal ulcer than those with non-ulcer dyspepsia (91/94% vs. 84/88% respectively, P = 0.011 and P = 0.016). Clarithromycin resistance rate was higher in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia than those with duodenal ulcer (14% vs. 6%, P = 0.015). Clarithromycin resistance (40% vs. 5%, P < 0.001, OR 12, 95% CI: 5.7-24.3) and the diagnosis of non-ulcer dyspepsia (91% vs. 84%, P = 0.011, OR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2-3.3) significantly affected the success of H. pylori eradication. CONCLUSION: Clarithromycin resistance accounts for the significantly lower and suboptimal H. pylori eradication rate of OCA regimen in Chinese patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia compared to those with duodenal ulcer.
