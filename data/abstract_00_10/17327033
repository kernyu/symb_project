OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characters and prognosis of postpartum choriocarcinoma. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 103 patients diagnosed with postpartum choriocarcinoma in Peking Union Medical College Hospital between 1985 and 2005 was performed. RESULTS: In a total of 103 cases of postpartum choriocarcinoma treated with multiagent cytotoxic chemotherapy and combined modality therapy, 92 patients (89.3%) achieved a complete remission while 2 patients had a partial remission, and 9 patients died. Regarding 25 cases with chemorefractory choriocarcinoma and 4 relapsed cases, 18 and 3 cases achieved a complete remission respectively. According to the new International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2000 staging and risk factor scoring system, 17 cases were at FIGO stage I, 8 cases at stage II, 56 cases at stage III, and 22 cases at stage IV. Complete remission was achieved in 100%, 8/8, 95% and 64% respectively. Thirty-five cases in low risk group had FIGO scores < or = 6, and all achieved a complete remission. Of 68 cases in high risk group with FIGO scores > or = 7, 57 (84%) of them obtained a complete remission. There were significant differences in the two groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Postpartum choriocarcinoma could have an increasing probability of cure with early diagnosis and the use of modern multiagent cytotoxic chemotherapy and combined modality therapy.
