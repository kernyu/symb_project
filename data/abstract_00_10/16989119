Antifungals of systemic use for the treatment of invasive fungal infections belong to four main chemical families which have globally three cellular targets in fungal cells: fluorinated pyrimidines act on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication and protein synthesis; polyenes and azoles are toxic for ergosterol and its biosynthetic pathway; lipopeptides inhibit the synthesis of cell wall beta glucans. The resistance mechanisms that are developed by some fungi begin to be well understood particularly in Candida yeasts. The underlying bases of these mechanisms are either mutations that modify the antifungal target, or that block access to the target, and, on the other hand, the overexpression of genes encoding the target, or some membrane proteins involved in the active efflux of antifungal drugs.
