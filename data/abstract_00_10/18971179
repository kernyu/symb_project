OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) for post-transplant recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with lamivudine-resistant YMDD mutation in liver recipients. METHODS: From March 2004 to May 2006, 20 patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with YMDD mutant HBV prior to liver transplantation received treatment with ADV and additional intramuscular hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) for prevention of post-transplant graft reinfection. The liver function, serum HBsAg, anti-HBs (HBIG), HBeAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBe, HBV DNA and creatinine were examined in all the patients before and after the transplantation. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration of these patients after the transplantation was 33.5 months. Nineteen patients survived and one patient died of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma. There was significant difference in YMDD mutation rate between the patients with HBV-DNA over 10(6) copies/ml and those with HBV-DNA less than 10(6) copies/ml (12.4% vs 2.5%, P < 0.05). HBV-DNA was undetectable at 4 weeks after the transplantation in 95.0% of the patients (19/20) and at 6 months in one case. No recurrence of hepatitis B was detected by long-term regular testing of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV-DNA. Serum creatinine increased in 1 case 1 year after the use of ADV. CONCLUSION: ADV offers protection against recurrence of HBV with YMDD mutation after liver transplantation with only mild nephrotoxicity, but renal function monitoring during the use of ADV is still necessary.
