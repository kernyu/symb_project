OBJECTIVE: The authors had for aim to assess, the incidence of symptomatic bacteriuria and the level of antibiotic resistance in bacteria identified in long-term care facilities (LTC). DESIGN: Symptomatic bacteriuria cases were prospectively collected, during 9 months in the two LTC of the Strasbourg French Teaching Hospital (196 beds). RESULTS: One hundred and eleven bacteriuria cases were included. They concerned 67 of the 274 residents (cumulative incidence: 2.07/1,000 patients-day). A gram-negative bacillus was identified in 85% of the symptomatic bacteriuria cases, and Escherichia coli in 40%. Sixty percent of the identified bacterial strain was resistant to amoxicillin (Amx-R) and 42% to the clavulanic acid combination (AmC-R). Third generation cephalosporins (3GC) were effective in 90% of Urinary tract infections (UTIs) and fluoroquinolones in 65% (Fq). Four bacterias with broad beta-lactamase spectrum were identified (0.04%) including 3 Enterobacter aerogenes. No yeast infection was diagnosed. E. coli strains were 65% Amx-R and 50% AmC-R. Concerning the Fq-R strains (15%), 50% were cotrimoxazole resistant (Stx-R) and 70% Amx-R; 3GC remained effective (82%). CONCLUSION: In LTC, multi-drug resistance bacteria are rare and 3GCs seem to be the best first line treatment. Nevertheless, Fq-R is increasing (15 vs 8%), and attention must be paid to the antibiotic therapy used.
