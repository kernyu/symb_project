The 'Stichting Werkgroep Antibioticabeleid' (SWAB; Dutch Working Party on Antibiotics Policy) has developed evidence-based guidelines for the antimicrobial treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriers for the eradication of MRSA. A distinction was made between uncomplicated and complicated carriage depending on the presence or absence of an active MRSA infection, skin lesions, foreign body material, mupirocin resistance and/or extranasal carriage. The indication for treatment is determined by the consequences of carriage for the carrier and his/her environment, the adverse events of treatment, and the likelihood of a successful treatment. The first choice of treatment in uncomplicated carriers is a combination of mupirocin nasal ointment and disinfectant soap for 5 days, along with hygiene advice. If treatment fails, sources in the vicinity of the patient must be sought. Complicated carriers receive a combination of 2 oral antibiotics, in addition to mupirocin nasal ointment and disinfectant soap, for at least 7 days.
