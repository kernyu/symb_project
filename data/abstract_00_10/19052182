A line probe assay (INNO-LiPA DR, version 3) for the detection of hepatitis B virus mutations that confer resistance to entecavir therapy was evaluated. The INNO-LiPA DR assay is a highly sensitive assay that is easily applicable for the detection and monitoring of entecavir resistance-conferring mutations and is more sensitive than sequencing for the detection of mixed sequences.
