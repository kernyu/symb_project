The objective of this study was to quantify the role of class 1 integrons in antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli isolated from turkey meat products purchased from retail outlets in the Midwestern United States. Of 242 E. coli isolates, 41.3% (102 of 242) tested positive for class 1 integrons. A significant association was shown between presence of class 1 integrons in E. coli isolates and the resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, sulfisoxazole, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Attributable risk analysis revealed that for every 100 E. coli isolates carrying class 1 integrons, resistance was demonstrated for ampicillin (22%), gentamycin (48%), streptomycin (29%), sulfisoxazole (40%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (7%), and tetracycline (26%). Non-integron-related antimicrobial resistance was demonstrated for ampicillin (65%), gentamycin (16.9%), streptomycin (42.1%), sulfisoxazole (35.8%), and tetracycline (49.7%). Population-attributable fraction analysis showed that class 1 integrons accounted for the following resistances: gentamycin, 71% (50 of 71), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 19.6% (6 of 33), nalidixic acid, 34% (7 of 21), streptomycin, 28% (30 of 107), sulfisoxazole, 38% (40 of 106), and tetracycline, 14%, (26 of 185). In conclusion, although class 1 integrons have been implicated in resistance to antimicrobial agents, other non-integron resistance mechanisms seem to play an important part.
