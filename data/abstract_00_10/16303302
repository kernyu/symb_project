Various isonicotinyl hydrazones were prepared by reacting isonicotinyl hydrazide [INH] with 1-(4-acetylphenyl)-3-[(4-sub)phenyl]thiourea and were tested for their antimycobacterial activity in vitro against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and INH-resistant M. tuberculosis using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. Among the synthesized compounds, 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-{1-[(pyridine-4-carbonyl)-hydrazono]ethyl}phenyl)thiourea (4d) was found to be the most potent compound with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.49 microM against M. tuberculosis H37Rv and INH-resistant M. tuberculosis. When compared to INH, 4d was found to be 3 and 185 times more active against M. tuberculosis H37Rv and INH-resistant M. tuberculosis, respectively, with a selectivity index of >300.
