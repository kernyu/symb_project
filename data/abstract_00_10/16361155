OBJECTIVE: To investigate the drug susceptibility of the clinical bacterial isolates to provide evidence for more adequate use of antibiotics. METHODS: Altogether 1017 clinical bacterial isolates were identified by BD Phoenix and tested for resistance against antimicrobial agents by K-B method. WHONET5 was applied for the analysis. RESULTS: The most frequent bacteria detected included P. aeruginosa (19.37%), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS, 17.70%), E. coli (13.27%), S. aureu (SA, 12.09%), E. faecalis (11.8%), and K. pneumoniae (7.57%). In gram-negative isolates, the susceptibility rate of imipenem was 81.5%, and that of ceftazidime was above 70%. The incidences of E.coli and K. pneumoniae isolates producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) were 34.8% and 45.5% respectively. In gram-positive isolates, the susceptibility rates of vancomycin and Teicoplanin were 98.8% and 100.0% respectively, and those of furazolidone, imipenem, amikacin, piperacillin/ tazobactam were above 70%. The oxacillin resistant rates of CNS and SA were 78.2% and 46.8%. CONCLUSION: The 1017 clinical bacterial isolates are characterized by high ratio of ESBL production and oxacillin resistance, suggesting the importance of adequate use of antimicrobial agents and effective control measures for reducing the drug resistance and preventing the spread of multi drug- resistant bacteria.
