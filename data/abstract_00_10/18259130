The aim of this study was to identify new compounds active against Plasmodium falciparum based on our previous research carried out on 3-phenyl-quinoxaline-2-carbonitrile 1,4-di-N-oxide derivatives. Twelve compounds were synthesized and evaluated for antimalarial activity. Eight of them showed an IC(50) less than 1 microM against the 3D7 strain. Derivative 1 demonstrated high potency (IC(50)= 0.63 microM) and good selectivity (SI=10.35), thereby becoming a new lead-compound.
