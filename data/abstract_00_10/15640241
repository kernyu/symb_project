PCR assays for analyzing resistance-nodulation-division transporters from solvent- and drug-resistant bacteria in soil were developed. Sequence analysis of amplicons showed that the PCR successfully retrieved transporter gene fragments from soil. Most of the genes retrieved from petroleum-contaminated soils formed a cluster (cluster PCS) that was distantly related to known transporter genes. Competitive PCR showed that the abundance of PCS genes is increased in petroleum-contaminated soil.
