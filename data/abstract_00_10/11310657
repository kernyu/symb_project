5-Thiourea and 5-dithiocarbamate oxazolidinones were synthesized as a continuation of research on 5-thiocarbonyl oxazolidinone antibacterial agents considering the hydrophobic parameters of the molecule. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) study revealed that the antibacterial activity on 5-thiocarbonyl oxazolidinones was significantly affected by the lipophilicity, especially the calculated log P value and the balance between 5-hydrophilic (or hydrophobic) substituent and hydrophobic (or hydrophilic) substituents on the benzene ring. Some of 5-thiocarbonyl oxazolidinones were found to have good in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).
