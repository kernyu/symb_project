The global spread of antibacterial resistance has important implications for the current and future management of bacterial respiratory tract infections in children. Data suggest that emerging resistance to commonly prescribed antibacterials, such as macrolides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is beginning to impact the treatment of these infections, which include acute otitis media, tonsillitis/pharyngitis and community-acquired pneumonia. There is, therefore, a need for additional agents that are active against common respiratory tract pathogens, including resistant strains and are suitable for use in children. Infection control measures to curb the clonal spread of antibacterial resistance are also extremely important.
