Coinfections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are common globally. HIV infection modifies the course of HBV infection by increasing rates of chronicity, prolonging HBV viremia, and increasing liver-related morbidity. To minimize the emergence of HIV and/or HBV resistance, as well as the emergence of liver enzyme flares, the treatment of both infections should be coordinated. Lamivudine or emtricitabine monotherapy readily selects resistant strains in the YMDD motif of the polymerase gene. Adefovir and tenofovir are fully active in the presence of YMDD mutations [corrected] If HBV treatment can be deferred until combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection is needed, the combination of tenofovir plus lamivudine or emtricitabine provides potent HBV therapy and a solid backbone for HIV combination antiretroviral therapy, and it likely decreases the emergence of HBV resistance.
