This study was the first conducted in Spain to evaluate the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and multi-resistance in Salmonella isolates recovered from finishing pigs from Spanish swine farms distributed over the whole country. For this purpose, 290 Salmonella isolates recovered from apparently healthy finishing pigs in a farm-based cross-sectional study and 192 Salmonella isolates recovered from faecal samples of finishing pigs suffering from diarrhoea were investigated. Resistance to a panel of 17 antimicrobials was determined using a broth microdilution technique. Resistance was a common finding and was detected in 90.3% of the Salmonella isolates from apparently healthy finishing pigs and 95.3% of the Salmonella isolates from clinically diseased finishing pigs. Resistance was particularly high among isolates of serogroup B and serovars Typhimurium and its monophasic variant S. 4,5,12:i:-. Higher frequencies of resistance were found to tetracycline, sulphamethoxazole, streptomycin, spectinomycin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. Less than 10% of the isolates were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, neomycin, cephalotin, apramycin and gentamicin. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, colistin and ceftiofur was rare (under 1%). Multi-resistance, defined as resistance to four or more drugs, was detected in more than 50% of the isolates. Although multi-resistance was particularly frequent among isolates of S. Typhimurium, it was also high among other serovars as Bredeney and the S. Typhimurium monophasic variant. 4,5,12:i:-.
