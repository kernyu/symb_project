With the rising frequency of fungal infections, as well as increasing reports of resistance to antifungal agents, it is imperative that clinically applicable antifungal susceptibility testing be available. In 1997 the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards published standard guidelines for antifungal susceptibility testing of Candida sp and Cryptococcus neoformans with amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole. Although the methods are standard, they are time consuming, can be difficult to interpret, and are approved only for testing limited organisms and drugs. Modifications to the methods and alternative approaches have been proposed to make these tests more convenient and efficient, applicable to a greater number of species, and appropriate for performing in the clinical laboratory.
