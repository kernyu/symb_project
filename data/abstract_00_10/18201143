The epidemiology of Candida infection in intensive care units (ICUs) and the management strategies for such infections in non-neutropenic intensive care patients are discussed in this review. Candida species are one of the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream infections and a significant cause of morbidity in patients admitted to the ICU. Prophylactic, pre-emptive and empiric treatment strategies for Candida infections have been explored in ICU patients. Routine prophylaxis should not be administered to the whole population of ICU patients, because the concerns about the selection of azole-resistant Candida strains or the induction of resistance are justified. Treatment of fungal infections is now possible with newer antifungal agents, including newer azoles (e.g., voriconazole, posaconazole) and echinocandins (e.g., micafungin, anidulafungin). However, there is a critical need for improvement in diagnosis of invasive Candida infection in order to provide clinicians the opportunity to intervene earlier in the diseases course.
