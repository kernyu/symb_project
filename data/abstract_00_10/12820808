A national survey was conducted using a mailed questionnaire in 2000 to quantify the prevalence in Italian hospitals of policies aimed to reduce the emergence and dissemination of resistant strains. The study population consisted of all of the Italian teaching and research hospitals, as well as all public hospitals with 300 beds or more; a 50% random sample of public hospitals smaller than 300 beds was selected. The overall response rate was 80% (428/535). Of the respondents, 9.6% claimed to have implemented a surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance and to be able to identify repeated isolations; 90% had a hospital formulary in place, 50% had a pharmacy committee, and 18% had an antibiotic policy subcommittee that met at least once a year in 1999. Forty-one percent implemented restriction policies based on written justifications for antibiotics, and 8% provided susceptibility results for first line antibiotics only. Antibiotic consumption was monitored by using the Defined Daily Dose, as a unit of measure, in 11% of the cases. Of the respondent hospitals, 251 (58.6%) claimed to have defined clinical practice guidelines for handwashing, 156 (36.4%) for isolation procedures, and seven (1.6%) for the control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Our data demonstrates that intensive efforts are necessary to understand barriers better to change and to identify solutions to adopt uniform, comprehensive policies for antimicrobial resistance in Italy.
