The paper presents the data of an investigation of the polymorphism of the pol gene encoding HIV-1 integrase in a HIV subtype G infected population formed during the 1989 HIV-infection outbreak. The investigators analyzed 41 samples of the viruses obtained in 2005-2007. Polymorphism at codons associated with integrase resistance to chemicals was observed in 11 virus variants. The circulation of mutation viruses that potentially promote the formation of resistance to the integrase inhibitors raltegravir and elvitegravir has been established in untreated patients.
