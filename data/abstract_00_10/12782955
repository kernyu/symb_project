BACKGROUND: Resistance of ciprofloxacin has been reported in several regions of the world, including India. In India, ciprofloxacin is still being used as single-dose treatment for gonorrhea. GOAL: The aim of the study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from patients with acute gonococcal urethritis in New Delhi. STUDY DESIGN: By means of disc diffusion, we determined the susceptibility profiles of N gonorrhoeae isolates, determined the MICs of ciprofloxacin, penicillin, and ceftriaxone, and compared our data with previous findings. RESULTS: On the basis of MIC values, 35.3% and 52.9% of strains were found to be resistant and less sensitive, respectively, to penicillin; 67.3% and 28.2% strains were observed to be resistant and less sensitive, respectively, to ciprofloxacin. Only one isolate (5.9%) was found to be less sensitive to ceftriaxone. CONCLUSION: The significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance in the current study indicates that resistance has developed under selective antibiotic pressure.
