Mechanisms of drought stress resistance were studied in Cistus clusii Dunal and Cistus albidus L., two native Mediterranean shrubs that can withstand severe summer drought. While water deficit, solar radiation and temperature increased from winter to summer in the field, C. clusii and C. albidus reduced leaf area, increased root mass per leaf area, and showed diurnal changes in stomatal conductance to minimize water loss. In both species, the consequent reductions in CO2 assimilation were accompanied by reduced efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry, and protection against stress was afforded by enhanced de-epoxidation of violaxanthin in the xanthophyll cycle and increases in alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene. In addition, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation was observed in mesophyll cell walls of both species during the first stages of drought, although no accumulation of H2O2 was observed in chloroplasts or other organelles during the study. Despite these common responses, C. albidus and C. clusii differed in the extent of photo- and antioxidative protection. In response to drought, C. clusii showed a higher de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle and higher alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene concentrations than C. albidus. We conclude that several structural and biochemical mechanisms underlie stress resistance in C. clusii and C. albidus, and are indicative of the different degrees of stress resistance of these shrubs.
