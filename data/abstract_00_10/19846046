We tested a mycobacteriophage D29-based method for fluoroquinolone susceptibility assessment in clinical isolates of Mycobacteriumtuberculosis. The method was incapable of identifying susceptible strains as such, although a slightly different published protocol successfully identified resistant and susceptible strains. Thus, caution is necessary when choosing an "in-house" D29-based protocol for testing of drug resistance.
