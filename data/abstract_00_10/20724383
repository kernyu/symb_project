The food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is able to form biofilms in food processing environments. Since biofilms are generally difficult to eradicate during clean-up procedures, they pose a major risk for the food industry. Stress resistance mechanisms involved in L. monocytogenes biofilm formation and disinfectant resistance have, to our knowledge, not been identified thus far. In this study, we investigated the role of hrcA, which encodes the transcriptional regulator of the class I heat-shock response, and dnaK, which encodes a class I heat-shock response chaperone protein, in static and continuous-flow biofilm formation and resistance against benzalkonium chloride and peracetic acid. Induction of both hrcA and dnaK during continuous-flow biofilm formation was observed using quantitative real-time PCR and promoter reporters. Furthermore, in-frame deletion and complementation mutants of hrcA and dnaK revealed that HrcA and DnaK are required to reach wild-type levels of both static and continuous-flow biofilms. Finally, disinfection treatments of planktonic-grown cells and suspended static and continuous-flow biofilm cells of wild-type and mutants showed that HrcA and DnaK are important for resistance against benzalkonium chloride and peracetic acid. In conclusion, our study revealed that HrcA and DnaK are important for L. monocytogenes biofilm formation and disinfectant resistance.
