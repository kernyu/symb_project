Azithromycin is a major drug used in the treatment and prophylaxis of chlamydial infections. Spontaneous azithromycin-resistant mutants of Chlamydia psittaci 6BC were isolated in vitro in the plaque assay at a frequency of about 10(-8). Isogenic clonal variants with A(2058)C, A(2059)G, or A(2059)C mutations in the unique 23S rRNA gene (Escherichia coli numbering system) displayed MICs for multiple macrolides (i.e., azithromycin, erythromycin, josamycin, and spiramycin) at least 100 times higher than those of the parent strain and were also more resistant to the lincosamide clindamycin. Chlamydia trachomatis L2 variants with a Gln-to-Lys substitution in ribosomal protein L4 at position 66 (E. coli numbering system), conferring an eightfold decrease in azithromycin and erythromycin sensitivities and a fourfold decrease in josamycin and spiramycin sensitivities, were isolated following serial passage in subinhibitory concentrations of azithromycin. Each mutation was stably maintained in the absence of selection but severely affected chlamydial infectivity, as determined by monitoring the development of each isolate over 46 h in the absence of selection, in pure culture or in 1:1 competition with the isogenic parent. Data in this study support the hypothesis that the mechanisms which confer high-level macrolide resistance in chlamydiae carry a prohibitive physiological cost and may thus limit the emergence of highly resistant clones of these important pathogens in vivo.
