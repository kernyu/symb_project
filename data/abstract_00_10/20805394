During a PCR-based surveillance study of beta-lactam resistance, 125 multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were obtained from 18 hospitals in Belgium from January 2008 to December 2009. Nine GES-positive A. baumannii isolates were detected at 6 Belgian hospitals. DNA sequencing of the bla(GES) genes identified GES-11, GES-12, and a novel variant GES-14, which differs from GES-11 by a single amino acid substitution (Gly170Ser). All index isolates were travel associated and originated from patients transferred from Turkey (n = 2), Egypt (n = 2), and Palestinian territories (Gaza) (n = 2). A nosocomial outbreak involving three additional patients occurred in a burn unit at a single hospital. No clonal relatedness could be established between the 6 index isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. Three different alleles (the plasmid-located bla(GES-11) and bla(GES-12) and a likely chromosomally located novel variant bla(GES-14)) were detected as part of a class 1 integron, also including the aac6'Ib and dfrA7 genes. Restriction analysis of plasmids suggests a common origin for the plasmids bearing bla(GES-11) and bla(GES-12). Cloning of the bla(GES) genes in Escherichia coli identified GES-14 as hydrolyzing imipenem, while GES-12 showed the highest specific activity against ceftazidime. This report highlights the emergence of various bla(GES-like) genes, especially those conferring carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii and its importation in Western Europe from Middle Eastern countries.
