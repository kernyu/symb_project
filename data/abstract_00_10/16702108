A 63-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis of the liver developed Candida glabrata fungemia after undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. Treatment with oral fluconazole was initially effective, but when the patient became neutropenic, subsequent blood cultures grew C. glabrata and a thrombus developed, which partially occluded the stent. Despite treatment with fluconazole, blood cultures remained positive for C. glabrata. Treatment with posaconazole resulted in clinical improvement and the patient had only intermittently positive fungal cultures for 6 weeks. A CT scan showed resolution of the inferior vena cava thrombus. Subsequently, the patient developed hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic encephalopathy and became noncompliant with posaconazole. Blood cultures again became positive for C. glabrata. The patient died a few weeks after the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, but the cause of death was believed to be worsening liver dysfunction, not C. glabrata infection. Posaconazole had controlled the infection for about 3 months prior to his death. In conclusion, posaconazole may be a useful option in the management of prosthetic endovascular infections caused by C. glabrata.
