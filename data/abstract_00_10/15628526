We examined the antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 1,024 Haemophilus influenzae isolates recovered from Japanese children. Percent distribution of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin (ABPC)--resistant strain (BLNAR; ABPC-MIC > or = 4 microg/ml) was 15.0%. Prevalence of BLNAR increased remarkably from 12.7 to 22.1% in recent 4 years. Furthermore, the frequency of highly resistant strains (ABPC-MIC > or = 8 microg/ml) increased from 28.6 to 56.9% among BLNAR. Decreased susceptibility for cephems was observed in non-BLNAR strains including serotype b strain isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid.
