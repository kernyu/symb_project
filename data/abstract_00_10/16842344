Vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) isolates from humans (23 isolates) and poultry (20 isolates) were characterized by antibiotic susceptibility, vancomycin resistance transferability, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and structural analysis of Tn1546-like elements. VRE isolates from humans and poultry showed different resistance patterns, transferability, and transfer rate. In addition to these phenotypic differences between humans and poultry VRE, PFGE and the structure of Tn1546-like elements were also distinct. Most poultry isolates (16/20) were identical to the prototype vanA transposon, Tn1546, while most human isolates (21/23) had multiple integrations of insertion sequence. The transmission of VRE and vancomycin resistance determinant between humans and poultry could not be demonstrated in this study.
