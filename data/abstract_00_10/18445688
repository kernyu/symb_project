Chloroquine resistance in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has made malaria increasingly difficult to control. Chloroquine-resistant parasites accumulate less chloroquine than their chloroquine-sensitive counterparts; however, the mechanism underlying this remains unclear. The primary site of accumulation and antimalarial action of chloroquine is the internal acidic digestive vacuole of the parasite, the acidity of which is maintained by inwardly-directed H+ pumps, working against the (outward) leak of H+. In this study we have investigated the leak of H+ from the digestive vacuole of the parasite by monitoring the alkalinisation of the vacuole following inhibition of the H+-pumping V-type ATPase by concanamycin A. The rates of alkalinisation observed in three chloroquine-resistant strains were two- to fourfold higher than those measured in three chloroquine-sensitive strains. On addition of chloroquine there was a dramatic increase in the rate of alkalinisation in the chloroquine-resistant strains, whereas chloroquine caused the rate of alkalinisation to decrease in the chloroquine-sensitive strains. The chloroquine-associated increase in the rate of alkalinisation seen in chloroquine-resistant parasites was inhibited by the chloroquine-resistance reversal agent verapamil. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that in chloroquine-resistant parasites chloroquine effluxes from the digestive vacuole, in association with H+, via a verapamil-sensitive pathway.
