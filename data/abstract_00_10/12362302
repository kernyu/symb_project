1. Factors associated with a lower rate of recurrent hepatitis B post-liver transplantation (LT) are negative hepatitis B e antigen and/or serum hepatitis B virus DNA pre-LT, hepatitis D virus superinfection, and fulminant hepatitis B. 2. Long-term intravenous hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) monotherapy can reduce the overall rate of recurrent hepatitis B to 20% to 35%. 3. Long-term lamivudine monotherapy is associated with a risk for drug resistance and overall 3-year rate of recurrent hepatitis B of 40% to 50%. 4. Combination prophylaxis with HBIG and lamivudine can reduce the overall rate of recurrent hepatitis B to 0% to 10%. 5. The dose and duration of HBIG therapy needed when used in combination with lamivudine may be lower, but the optimal regimen remains to be determined. 6. Lamivudine resistance before LT is associated with an increased risk for recurrent hepatitis B post-LT. 7. A cost-effective prophylactic regimen to prevent recurrent hepatitis B should be tailored according to risk.
