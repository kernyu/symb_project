This review concerning the major lower respiratory tract pathogens in France has for aim to describe the epidemiology of resistance to beta-lactams, macrolides, ketolides, and fluoroquinolones especially in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. It should also provide new insights on the mechanisms of acquired resistance and the level of resistance conferred, highlighting the related ecological impact. In the context of this XVth consensus conference, this review should contribute to the elaboration of guidelines for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in adults.
