A chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (catB7) gene containing two point mutations, 181A/G and 314A/G, has been recently reported to be a determinant for high-level chloramphenicol resistance phenotype in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAhcr1. The mutant CATB7 was further characterized in vitro and in vivo to elucidate the molecular basis of high-level resistance. CAT assay demonstrated that the mutant and wild-type recombinant CATB7 had similar specific activities. Dot blotting revealed that the accumulated amounts of CATB7 in P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 and PAhcr1 were proportionate to the respective anti-chloramphenicol level. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that G61S and Y105C contributed synergistically to the PAhcr1 resistance phenotype. It could be proposed that the mutant CATB7 was more structurally stable than catalytically efficient as a chloramphenicol resistance determinant in PAhcr1.
