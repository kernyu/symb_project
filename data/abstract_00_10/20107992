Streptococcus pyogenes is indigenous to the human pharynx and causes acute pharyngitis. Balanoposthitis is an inflammatory disease of the glans and the foreskin. However, balanoposthitis caused by S. pyogenes is not widely recognized as a sexually transmitted disease. In addition, bacteriological features of the isolates causing balanoposthitis are unclear. The four S. pyogenes strains isolated from adult balanoposthitis were examined. We performed emm typing, T antigen typing, RAPD assay, PCR assay for the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin-related genes and antibiotic-resistant genes, and antibiotic susceptibility assay. All four strains were suspected to be transmitted by penile-oral sexual intercourse, were found to be different by genetic analysis, and also harbored some antibiotic-resistant factors. We propose that S. pyogenes should be considered as a causative agent of sexually transmitted disease. The drug resistant S. pyogenes must be taken into account when balanoposthitis patients are treated with antibiotic.
