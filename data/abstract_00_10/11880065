OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of single-dose and 3-day fluoroquinolone treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). METHODS: Adult women with acute uncomplicated UTI were randomized to receive either a single dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg), 3 days of gatifloxacin (200 mg daily), or 3 days of ciprofloxacin (100 mg twice daily). Patients were assessed at four points during the study: before treatment (within 48 hours before the initiation of the study medication), at the end of treatment (by telephone contact on day 3), and twice after treatment completion (5 to 9 days after treatment [test-of-cure visit] and 29 to 42 days after treatment [only patients with a bacteriologic response of eradication at the test-of-cure visit]). RESULTS: The bacterial eradication rate for the single-dose gatifloxacin, 3-day gatifloxacin, and 3-day ciprofloxacin groups was 90%, 95%, and 89%, respectively; the clinical efficacy rate was 93%, 95%, and 93%, respectively, for microbiologically assessable patients at the test-of-cure visit. Eradication of the most common uropathogens, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, was achieved with gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Single-dose gatifloxacin was equivalent to 3-day ciprofloxacin in both microbiologic and clinical efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose and 3-day gatifloxacin were microbiologically and clinically equivalent to 3-day ciprofloxacin for the treatment of acute UTI among women. Single-dose gatifloxacin may offer advantages over 3-day fluoroquinolone therapy for uncomplicated UTI by decreasing secondary use of medical resources and improving patient compliance.
