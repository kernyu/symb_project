Enfuvirtide (T-20) is the first approved HIV-1 entry into cells' inhibitor. It is a peptide with an amino acid sequence analogue to HR2 region of the viral surface glycoprotein gp41. Its mechanism of action is the competitive binding to HR1 region of the gp41, preventing the interaction between HR1 and HR2 and impeding the conformational changes in gp41 necessary for fusion of the virus with the cell. Its application is by subcutaneous injection. The main clinical trials of enfuvirtide (TORO 1 and 2) were performed in HIV-infected patients with virological failure, high antiretroviral experience and highly resistant viral isolates. Those trials showed that the addition of enfuvirtide to an optimized HAART (chosen with a resistance test) provided better results than HAART alone, measured by drop in viral load and immunologic benefit. The best results were observed in the subgroup of patients with more useful drugs in HAART (according to the information of the resistance test), a lower viral load, and a higher CD4 cell count at baseline. The most important adverse event is the production of injection drug hypersensitivity reaction in 98% of patients. The high cost is compensated by a reduction in costs derived from admissions.
