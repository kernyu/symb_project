Cryptotanshinone (1), a quinoid diterpene with a nor-abietane skeleton, and three new natural products, 1beta-hydroxycryptotanshinone (2), 1-oxocryptotanshinone (3), and 1-oxomiltirone (4), were isolated from roots of the Iranian medicinal plant Perovskia abrotanoides. Their structures were established using homo- and heteronuclear two-dimensional NMR experiments, supported by HRMS. The total amount of tanshinones isolated from dry roots of Perovskia abrotanoides was about 1.5%. The compounds exhibited leishmanicidal activity in vitro (IC(50) values in the range 18-47 microM). These findings provide a rationale for traditional use of the roots in Iran as a constituent of poultices for treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The isolated tanshinones also inhibited growth of cultured malaria parasites (3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparum), drug-sensitive KB-3-1 human carcinoma cell line, multidrug-resistant KB-V1 cell line, and human lymphocytes activated with phytohaemagglutinin A (IC(50) values in the range 5-45 microM). The toxicity of tanshinones toward the drug-sensitive KB-3-1 and the multidrug-resistant KB-V1 cells was the same, indicating that the compounds are not substrates for the P-glycoprotein drug efflux pump.
