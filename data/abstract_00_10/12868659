Thirty-nine multiresistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) isolates were obtained from 33 children and 6 adults hospitalized from 1996 to 1999 in the University Hospital of Amiens (France). S. Typhimurium was cultured from stools (n=36), blood samples (n=2) and peritoneal fluid (n=1). These isolates were characterized by biotyping, antibiotic susceptibility test, RAPD-PCR, and PFGE typing. Emergence of pentaresistant S. Typhimurium isolates (phenotype ACSSuTe) was observed, and five of them were resistant to nalidixic acid and of intermediate susceptibility to pefloxacin. Genotypic analysis of both RAPD and PFGE results showed that there were 7 different patterns. Thirty-three isolates gave an identical pattern (AI) and were considered as epidemic isolates; the six remaining patterns (each containing one isolate) corresponded to sporadic cases. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns, RAPD and PFGE patterns subdivided the 39 isolates into 9 clonally related groups. One of them (pattern AI and R-pattern a) was implicated in 74% of the cases.
