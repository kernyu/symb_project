OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine the long-term clinical outcomes after an initial strategy of paclitaxeleluting stent (PES) implantation for de novo sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) restenosis. BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of drug-eluting stent (DES) restenosis is unknown. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing PES implantation for SES restenosis were identified. Patients were considered eligible for inclusion if: (1) the initial target lesion for the SES was de novo; (2) the SES restenotic lesion had not been previously treated; and (3) at least 1 year had passed since the PES implantation. RESULTS: A total of 130 consecutive patients with 142 restenotic SES lesions were treated with PES. Mean patient age was 66.4 +/- 11 years, diabetes was present in 37.1%, and the target lesion was focal in 67.8%. Over a median of 453 days (range, 365-789 days), out-ofhospital major adverse cardiac events occurred in 33 patients (25.4%). Out-of-hospital death occurred in 2 patients (due to sepsis and cancer), myocardial infarction in 1 patient (0.8%), and target lesion revascularization (TLR) in 30 patients (23.8%). There were no episodes of stent thrombosis. There was no difference in freedom from TLR between lesions with focal or non-focal pattern (log rank p = 0.52), although the time to recurrence was later in focal compared to non-focal lesions (323 +/- 26 days versus 216 +/- 17 days; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: An initial treatment strategy of PES implantation for SES restenosis appears safe and provides reasonable outcomes at more than 1-year follow up.
