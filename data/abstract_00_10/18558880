The genetic diversity of group B Streptococcus in young, nonpregnant women is not well studied. Application of multilocus sequence analysis to 85 group B Streptococcus strains recovered from college students revealed similarities and differences in distribution of group B Streptococcus lineages, compared with that of previously studied pregnant populations, and revealed that strains of 1 clone were associated with antibiotic resistance.
