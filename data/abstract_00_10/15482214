Adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera, Gilead Sciences) is a prodrug of adefovir, with potent antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus. Adefovir dipivoxil therapy, 10 mg daily for 48 weeks, is effective in hepatitis B e antigen-positive and -negative chronic hepatitis B. In hepatitis B e antigen-negative chronic hepatitis B, adefovir dipivoxil was recently found to maintain its efficacy even after 3 years of therapy. Adefovir dipivoxil is effective in patients with compensated or decompensated chronic viral B liver disease, and in pre- and post-transplant hepatitis B virus patients who develop resistance to lamivudine (Epivir, GlaxoSmithKline). It is well-tolerated and safe even after the third year of long-term therapy, and is associated with low rates of viral resistance. All these characteristics make adefovir dipivoxil an important drug for the treatment of hepatitis B virus infection and an excellent candidate for long-term maintenance therapy in chronic viral B liver disease.
