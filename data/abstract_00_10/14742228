The dynamics of mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs were analyzed after cessation of therapy. The results showed that the kinetics of the shift to wild-type amino acid residues were significantly faster for protease inhibitors, intermediate for nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and slower for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
