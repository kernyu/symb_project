We present a 43-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug abuse who presented to the emergency department with a 5-week history of lower urinary tract symptoms. On digital rectal examination, a firm prostate with exquisite tenderness was noted. Computed tomography scan of the pelvis with contrast demonstrated a 4.4 by 2.7-cm prostatic abscess in the right lobe. Suppurative fluid was expressed from the right prostatic lobe during transurethral resection of the prostate. Cultures of blood and suppurative prostatic fluid grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
