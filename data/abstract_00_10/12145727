An open-label, multicenter study was performed to assess bacteriologic findings associated with chronic bacterial maxillary sinusitis in adults. Seventy aerobic (52.2%) and 64 anaerobic (47.8%) pathogens were recovered from clinically evaluable patients at baseline (before therapy). The most commonly isolated anaerobes were Prevotella species (31.1%), anaerobic streptococci (21.9%), and Fusobacterium species (15.6%). The aerobes most frequently recovered included Streptococcus species (21.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (15.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.7%), and Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis (10.0% each). Recurrences of signs or symptoms of bacterial maxillary sinusitis associated with anaerobes were twice as frequent as were those associated with aerobes when counts of anaerobes were > or =10(3) cfu/mL. A pathogenic role for Granulicatella species in cases of chronic sinusitis was documented for the first time.
