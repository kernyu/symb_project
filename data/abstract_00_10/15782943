The antipsychotic drug prochlorperazine was screened in vitro for possible antimicrobial property against 157 strains of bacteria, belonging to gram positive and gram negative genera. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of prochlorperazine was determined by agar dilution method, which ranged from 25 to 200 microg/ml with respect to most of the strains. Based on such findings, a further study was undertaken to determine whether the efficacy of this drug could be enhanced in the presence of an antihistaminic agent methdilazine, reported to have remarkable antimicrobial action. Four bacterial strains, sensitive to prochlorperazine as well as to three antibacterial chemotherapeutics, viz., methdilazine, fluphenazine and thioridazine were chosen. Disc diffusion tests with prochlorperazine and methdilazine revealed marked synergism between the combination, compared to their individual effects. The synergism was found to be statistically significant (p<0.01). To assess the degree of synergism, the checkerboard analysis was performed. The FIC index of this combination turned out to be 0.37, which confirmed synergism. Therefore, this synergistic drug combination might open a new therapeutic approach to combat drug-resistance in bacterial infections.
