Staphylococcus aureus is one of the major causes of community and hospital-acquired infections. Bacteriophage considered as a major risk factor acquires S. aureus new virulence genetic elements. A total number of 119 S. aureus isolated from different specimens obtained from (RKH) were distinguished by susceptibility to 19 antimicrobial agents, phage typing, and PCR amplification for mecA gene. All of MRSA isolates harbored mecA gene, except three unique isolates. The predominant phage group is belonging to the (mixed group). Phage group (II) considered as an epidemiological marker correlated to beta-lactamase hyper producer isolates. MRSA isolates indicated high prevalence of phage group (II) with highly increase for phage types (O3A), which were correlated to the skin. Phage types (O80/O81) played an important roll in Community Acquired Methicillin Resistant S. aureus (CAMRSA). Three outpatients MRSA isolates had low multiresistance against Bacitracin (Ba) and Fusidic acid (FD), considered as CAMRSA isolates. It was detected that group I typed all FD-resistant MSSA isolates. Phage groups (M) and (II) were found almost to be integrated for Gentamycin (GN) resistance especially phage type (O95) which relatively increased up to 20% in MRSA. Tetracycline (TE) resistant isolates typed by groups (II) and (III) in MSSA. Only one isolate resistant to Sulphamethoxazole/Trimethoprim (SXT) was typed by (III/V) alone in MSSA. MRSA isolates resistant to Chloramphenicol (C) and Ba were typed by all groups except (V). It could be concluded that (PERSA) S. aureus isolates from the wound that originated and colonized, and started to build up multi-resistance against the topical treatment antibiotics. In this study, some unique sporadic isolates for both MRSA and MSSA could be used as biological, molecular and epidemiological markers such as prospective tools.
