SUBJECT: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is usually treated by interferon alpha. However, a sustained response after stopping treatment is only obtained in 30% of patients. ACTUALITY: New therapeutic nucleoside analogs have been developed, i.e. lamivudine, famciclovir, adefovir, entecavir, clevudine. However, as in HIV infection, clearance of the original hepatitis B virus with emergence of distinct resistant mutants have been observed during or after treatment with most nucleoside analogs. In this review, the underlying mechanisms of resistance and the characterisation of HBV mutants are described to optimize the best therapeutic regimen. PERSPECTIVES: Treatment of chronic HBV infection, as most of other chronic viral infection, should be based on combination therapy with a special search for the appearance of HBV mutant resistant.
