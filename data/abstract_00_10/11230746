Induction of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) appear to be one of the mechanisms by which ethanol is hepatotoxic. Glutathione peroxidase and catalase detoxify H(2)O(2). Glutathione S-transferases (GST) provide protection from membrane lipid peroxidation, have GSH peroxidase activity, and reduce lipid hydroperoxides. Previous studies showed an up-regulation of GSH synthesis in CYP2E1 expressing HepG2 cells; this finding prompted an evaluation of the levels of other antioxidant exzymes. In CYP2E1 expressing cells, the alpha and microsomal GST messenger RNA (mRNA) are increased by 4- and 2-fold, respectively, and catalase protein and mRNA is increased by 2-fold. The increase in alpha and microsomal GST mRNA correlates with increased total enzymatic activity and is caused by increased transcription as evidenced by run-on transcription assays. In HepG2 cells transfected to express a different cytochrome P450, CYP3A4, there was an increase in alpha GST. However, in contrast to the CYP2E1 expressing cells, neither microsomal GST nor catalase were induced, suggesting some specificity for CYP2E1. In agreement with an increased antioxidant defense system, the sensitivity to added prooxidants such as menadione, antimycin A, H(2)O(2), and 4-hydroxynonenal was lower in the CYP2E1 expressing cells as compared with control cells. In conclusion, overexpression of CYP2E1 in HepG2 cells, besides elevating total GSH levels, also induces expression of catalase and alpha and microsomal GST. This induction confers resistance to the cells against several prooxidants and is suggested to reflect an adaptive response by the cells against CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress.
