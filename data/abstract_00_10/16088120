BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common infections of mankind, with persistent colonization causing significant morbidity and mortality. TREATMENT: First-line therapy, consisting of 7-day treatment with a proton pump inhibitor or ranitidine bismuth citrate, amoxicillin and clarithromycin, with second-line therapy, consisting of a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline, in the case of failure, is chosen as the most cost-effective method of H. pylori eradication. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of these antiinfectives is limited by lack of compliance with treatment regimens, and increasing antibiotic resistance.
