Providing the optimum treatment of AIDS is a major challenge in the 21st Century. HIV is localised and harboured in certain inaccessible compartments of the body, such as the CNS, the cerebrospinal fluid, the lymphatic system and in the macrophages, where it cannot be reached by the majority of therapeutic agents in adequate concentrations or in which the therapeutic agents cannot reside for the necessary duration. Progression in HIV/AIDS treatment suggests that available therapy can lower the systemic viral load below the detection limit. However, on discontinuation of treatment, there is relapse of the infection from the reservoir sites and a potential for resistance development. This review discusses the aetiology and pathology of HIV, with emphasis on the viral reservoirs, current therapy of AIDS, and the opportunity for nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems to facilitate complete eradication of viral load from the reservoir sites. Literature-cited examples of drug delivery systems that are under investigation for the treatment of AIDS are discussed. The article also focuses on the future outlook and strategies for investigational drug formulations that use nanotherapeutic strategy for HIV/AIDS.
