A novel carbohydrate-derived side-chain polyether was synthesized as a new biomaterial by condensation polymerization of monomers derived from natural occurring carbohydrates. Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy studies demonstrated that this side-chain polyether has excellent resistance to nonspecific protein adsorption. The protein resistant capability of the side-chain polyether is comparable to that of oligoethylene glycol, a main-chain polyether that is, to date, the best protein resistant material. In addition to the excellent biocompatibility, the new polymer also combines biodegradability and functionalizability. With these combined good properties, this side-chain polyether is envisioned as a new biomaterial for many potential biomedical applications.
