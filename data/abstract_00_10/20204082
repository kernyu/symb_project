Surgical site infections are a mean topic in cardiac surgery, leading to a prolonged hospitalization, and substantially increased morbidity and mortality. One source of pathogens is the endogenous flora of the patient's skin, which can contaminate the surgical site. A number of preoperative skin care strategies are performed to reduce bacterial contamination like preoperative antiseptic showering, hair removal, antisepsis of the skin, adhesive barrier drapes, and antimicrobial prophylaxis. Furthermore we can also support the natural host defense by optimal intra-operative management of oxygen supply, normoglycemia, and temperature. Nevertheless we still have a number of patients, who develop a surgical site infection. Therefore new skin care strategies are introduced to reduce the contamination by the endogenous skin flora. We present the use of a new microbial sealant, InteguSeal((R)), which was evaluated in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The preliminary results of this investigation showed a trend in surgical site infection reduction by the use of this new microbial sealant.
