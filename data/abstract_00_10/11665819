In human KB and LoVo cell lines, high affinity taurine uptake was strongly reduced in both a time and dose-dependent manner by cumene hydroperoxide (CH) and to a lesser extent by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Uptake-inhibition was greater in multidrug resistant (MDR) cells than in their non-MDR counterparts. Basal taurine efflux was unaffected by the oxidants. Lipid peroxidation levels closely correlated with the uptake inhibition levels, and were greater in MDR cells than in their non-MDR counterparts. The two oxidants reduced the Vmax and, to a lesser extent, the affinity of the transporter for taurine. They also reduced low affinity taurine uptake and, to a lesser extent, taurine diffusion. The composition of the medium used for cell treatment, especially its pyruvate content, greatly affected the H2O2 effect. H2O2- or CH-induced reduction of the high affinity taurine uptake was unaffected by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and by the calmodulin antagonist W-13, ruling out the involvement of PKC and perhaps of calmodulin kinases in their effect.
