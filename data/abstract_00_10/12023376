Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis destroys the cornea in susceptible (B6), but not resistant (BALB/c) mice. To determine mechanisms mediating resistance, the role of IFN-gamma, IL-12, and IL-18 was tested in BALB/c mice. RT-PCR analysis detected IFN-gamma mRNA expression levels in cornea that were significantly increased at 1-7 days postinfection. IL-18 mRNA was detected constitutively in cornea and, at 1-7 days postinfection, levels were elevated significantly, while no IL-12 mRNA was similarly detected. To test whether IL-18 contributed to IFN-gamma production, mice were treated with anti-IL-18 mAb. Treatment decreased corneal IFN-gamma mRNA levels, and bacterial load and disease increased/worsened, compared with IgG-treated mice. To stringently examine the role of IFN-gamma in bacterial killing, knockout (-/-) vs wild-type (wt) mice also were tested. All corneas perforated, and bacterial load was increased significantly in -/- vs wt mice. Because disease severity was increased in IFN-gamma(-/-) vs IL-18-neutralized mice, and since IL-18 also induces production of TNF, we tested for TNF-alpha in both groups. ELISA analysis demonstrated significantly elevated corneal TNF-alpha protein levels in IFN-gamma(-/-) vs wt mice after infection. In contrast, RT-PCR analysis of IL-18-neutralized vs IgG-treated infected mice revealed decreased corneal TNF-alpha mRNA expression. Next, to resolve whether TNF was required for bacterial killing, TNF-alpha was neutralized in BALB/c mice. No difference in corneal bacterial load was detected in neutralized vs IgG-treated mice. These data provide evidence that IL-18 contributes to the resistance response by induction of IFN-gamma and that IFN-gamma is required for bacterial killing.
