A series of primaquine-derived imidazolidin-4-ones were screened for their in vitro activity against Pneumocystis carinii and Plasmodium falciparum W2 strain. Most compounds were active against P. carinii above 10 microg/mL and displayed slight to marked activity. The imidazolidin-4-ones most active against P. carinii were also those most active antiplasmodial agents, in the muM range. One of the tested imidazolidin-4-ones was slightly more active than the parent primaquine and may represent a lead compound for the development of novel anti-P. carinii 8-aminoquinolines with increased stability and resistance to metabolic inactivation.
