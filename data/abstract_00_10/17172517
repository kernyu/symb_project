The prevalence of CTX-M-producing members of the Enterobacteriaceae is increasing worldwide. A novel, multiplex, real-time TaqMan PCR assay to detect and type bla(CTX-M) genes is described which is an improvement on previously described techniques with respect to reduced assay time, elimination of the need for protracted post-PCR processing and the convenience of a single reaction vessel. Based on beta-lactam antibiogram and MIC data, 478 of 1279 Enterobacteriaceae isolates from clinical blood and urine culture specimens were selected and tested for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production using phenotypic methods. The new TaqMan assay detected and typed bla(CTX-M) genes in 21 of 28 ESBL-producing isolates.
