Diabetes mellitus (DM) is known as one of the factors that increases the risk of tuberculosis (TB). TB can also show atypical clinical presentation and localization in diabetics. The aim of the study was to evaluate the features of TB in diabetics in our region. Between 1997 and 2003, all cases of diabetic TB patients and an equal number of non-diabetics treated and followed at the Esrefpasa Tuberculosis Dispensary were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 78 (7.3%) TB cases in DM patients was encountered among 1,063 TB cases. Cavity formation and atypical localization were more often found in diabetics (P<0.05). Duration of treatment was longer in diabetics (P<0.05). The rate of drug resistance was higher in DM cases, but cure rates were similar between groups. A diagnosis of TB should be considered in diabetics with an abnormal chest radiograph, in the presence of absence of specific clinical symptoms, in endemic regions. Diabetic TB cases should be followed especially closely in terms of cure time and drug resistance.
