Four new meroterpenes, alisiaquinones A-C (1-3) and alisiaquinol (4), were isolated from a New Caledonian deep water sponge. Their structures and relative stereochemistry were elucidated by spectroscopic data analysis. They are related to xestoquinone, but showed unusual substitution on a tetrahydrofuran junction. They displayed micromolar range activity on two enzymatic targets of importance for the control of malaria, the plasmodial kinase Pfnek-1 and a protein farnesyl transferase, as well as on different chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Alisiaquinone C displayed a submicromolar activity on P. falciparum and a competitive selectivity index on the different plasmodial strains.
