Ten HIV-infected nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-treated subjects with lipoatrophy or sustained hyperlactatemia were given antioxidants: vitamins C, E, and N-acetyl cysteine. After 24 weeks, anthropometrics did not change significantly, except for a modest decrease in the waist-to-hip ratio. Fasting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol trended toward lower values. Fasting glucose significantly increased along with a significant increase in homeostatic model assessment values, reflecting an increase in insulin resistance. Controlled trials are required to evaluate directly the effects of these agents on lipid and glucose metabolism.
