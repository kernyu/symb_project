PURPOSE: The purpose of this case report is to demonstrate the need for identification of the offending pathogen in bacterial keratitis to guide appropriate treatment. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: We report a case of Listeria monocytogenes keratitis in a young healthy adult that failed to respond to standard empirical therapy for bacterial keratitis but was treated successfully with topical ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and systemic amoxicillin. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the need for identification of the offending pathogen to guide appropriate treatment. It also demonstrates discrepancy between in vitro sensitivity and clinical response.
