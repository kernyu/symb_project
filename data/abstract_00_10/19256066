Several studies have reported high rate of antimicrobial resistance, particularly in strains isolated from hospitals. The aim of this study was to review the pathogens associated with nosocomial infections at the Clinic for abdominal surgery, Clinic for urology, Clinic for orthopedic surgery and Clinic for resuscitation and anaesthesia of the Clinical Center of Vojvodina. The analysis of the collected data gave indecisive results. The percentage of positive cultures was too low to enable making therapeutic recommendations. The first-line antibiotics, according to the international reccomendations, should be included more often in sensitivity tests of isolated bacterial strains. Isolated bacteria were most frequently tested to the second and third-line antibiotics respectively, to which the resistance rate is becoming concerningly high.
