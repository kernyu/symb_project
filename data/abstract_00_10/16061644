Malignantly transformed stem cells represent a potential common nidus for the primary cancer and the recurrent cancer that arises after treatment failure. Putative prostate stem cells and prostate tumor stem cells in benign and malignant human prostate tissue, in primary human prostate xenografts, and in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mouse model of prostate cancer, are defined by expression of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), a marker of pluripotent hematopoietic, muscle, and neural stem cells, and by an absence of androgen receptor (AR) protein. Inhibition of BCRP-mediated efflux of dihydrotestosterone by novobiocin or fumitremorgin C in a rat prostate progenitor cell line that expresses BCRP and AR mRNAs, but minimal AR protein, results in stabilization and nuclear translocation of AR protein, providing a mechanism for lack of AR protein in BCRP-expressing stem cells. In both benign and malignant human prostate tissue, the rare epithelial cells that express BCRP and lack AR protein are localized in the basal cell compartment, survive androgen deprivation, and maintain proliferative potential in the hypoxic, androgen-deprived prostate. Putative prostate tumor stem cells that express BCRP but not AR protein in TRAMP are the source of a BCRP-negative and AR-negative, Foxa2- and SV40Tag-expressing, transit amplifying compartment that progresses to the poorly differentiated carcinomas that arise rapidly after castration. Therefore, BCRP expression isolates prostate stem/tumor stem cells from the prostate tissue microenvironment through constitutive efflux of androgen, protecting the putative tumor stem cells from androgen deprivation, hypoxia, or adjuvant chemotherapy, and providing the nidus for recurrent prostate cancer.
