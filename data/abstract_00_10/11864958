Four amino acid substitutions, two in GyrA and two in ParC subunits of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, respectively, are commonly responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance in Escherichia coli. In this study, an economical and time-efficient mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA) PCR was developed to detect mutations in the chromosomal gyrA and parC genes causing these substitutions. One hundred and twenty-one clinical E. coli isolates were tested by this assay, and the results confirmed that accumulation of amino acid alterations in GyrA and ParC correlates closely with stepwise increases in the MIC of ciprofloxacin.
