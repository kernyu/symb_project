A survey was conducted on the occurrence of anthelmintic resistance of nematodes in communally grazed goats in a semi-arid area in South Africa. In herds belonging to 10 small-holder goat farmers, the efficacies of fenbendazole, levamisole and rafoxanide were tested by faecal egg count reduction (FECR) tests. Efficacies of 80% were considered a threshold for anthelmintic resistance. The FECR tests showed that all drugs tested more than 80% effective in most instances, but there were notable exceptions. In 1 case, rafoxanide was only 31% effective and in another case fenbendazole was only 47% effective. The occurrence of anthelmintic resistance in this farming sector is of concern. Steps should be taken to prevent its further spread and to avoid the development of a situation as on numerous commercial sheep farms in South Africa where resistance is very common.
