Studies using drugs that cause the disassembly of filamentous actin (F-actin) have demonstrated the importance of an intact actin cytoskeleton for polarised secretion by yeast cells [1,2]. To address the level of dynamic turnover needed for such processes, however, drugs or mutants that confer stabilising properties on F-actin are needed. Jasplakinolide is the only readily available drug that stabilises F-actin structures both in vivo and in vitro [3-6]. Yeast strains have been generated in which two of the ABC multidrug resistance transporter genes have been deleted, rendering normally jasplakinolide-resistant yeast cells sensitive to its effects. Treatment of these cells with jasplakinolide caused rapid and dramatic effects on the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in the accumulation of single large actin structures in cells. These structures, however, still contained components that are normally associated with cortical actin patches. A dynamic actin cytoskeleton was found to be critical for the generation of cell polarity and endocytosis.
