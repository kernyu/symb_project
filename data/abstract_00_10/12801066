In this report, the controversy concerning the sensitivity of dendritic cells (DCs) to Fas-dependent induction of apoptosis was examined using murine DCs. Although DCs could not be lysed when exposed to an anti-Fas antibody, Jo2, the observed resistance turned out to reflect their lack of the expression of Fc(gamma)R necessary for crosslinking the antibody, rather than their intrinsic resistance. Thus, at least a fraction of DCs was sensitive to Jo2 in the presence of Fc(gamma)R-expressing by-standers. Consistently, a significant fraction of DCs was sensitive to Fas-dependent lysis mediated by T cells including the antigen-specific killing by CD4+ T cells. Both immature (class II MHClow) and mature (class II MHChigh) DCs were sensitive to the Fas-based induction of apoptosis.
