The MICs for 162 diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains and 28 Shigella strains were determined on the basis of NCCLS guidelines. More than 75% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol (53.6% of Shigella strains), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Multiresistance was detected in 89.5% of E. coli strains and 78.6% of Shigella strains.
