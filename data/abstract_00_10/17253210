This is so far the first published case report of a Nocardia paucivorans infection in an immunocompetent patient. A 54-year-old farmer was hospitalised with a history of coughing and fever for a period of five months. There was no indicator of either primary of secondary immunodeficiency in the prior medical history. A chest X-ray showed pneumonic infiltrates in the right middle und lower lobes, which progressed despite of antibiotic therapy with macrolides. A transbronchial biopsy revealed unspecific granulomatous inflammation of soft tissues. N. paucivorans - grew in cultures of sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, and transbronchial biopsy. Oral antibiotic therapy was started with trimethoprime-sulphamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) and amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. Susceptibility testing revealed high level resistance to TMP/SMX, which was consequently replaced by ciprofloxacin. Six months later, infiltrates had completely resolved and the patient did not report any residual clinical symptoms. The present case showed once again that nocardiosis is not limited to patients with immunodeficiencies. However, conservative combination therapy with oral antibiotics seems to be sufficiently effective for nocardiosis in the immunocompetent patient. For cases of suspected nocardiosis, a step-wise, risk-based diagnostic and therapeutic procedure is proposed.
