In an attempt to assess the level of quinolone resistance and its association with other antimicrobial resistance in faecal Escherichia coli isolated from routine outpatient specimens in Hong Kong, ciprofloxacin-supplemented MacConkey agar was used to screen for resistant isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates was done by VITEK 2 and previous amplification-based methods were employed to characterize the genetic determinants behind some of the resistance phenotypes. One hundred and seventy-six (43%) of 409 specimens had quinolone-resistant E. coli isolated (199 isolates). Quinolone resistance was found to be associated with resistances to penicillins (>80%) and co-trimoxazole (69%). Nonsusceptibility to combinations of penicillins and clavulanic acid was above 20% and up to 50% for the aminoglycosides gentamicin and tobramycin. CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were found responsible for most cephalosporin resistances but the transferable quinolone resistance determinant qnrA was not detected. Our data suggested that a high percentage of E. coli isolates as part of the alleged normal intestinal microflora in humans appeared to be resistant to quinolones. Co-resistance to various other frequently used antimicrobials was also observed. Transferable genetic determinants were found to be involved in some cases.
