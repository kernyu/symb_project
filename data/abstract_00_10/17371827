The susceptibilities of drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants to lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, entecavir, and 2,4-diamino-6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethoxy]-pyrimidine (PMEO-DAPym), a novel acyclic pyrimidine analogue, were assessed in vitro. Most drug-resistant mutants, including multidrug-resistant strains, remained sensitive to tenofovir and PMEO-DAPym. Therefore, the latter molecule deserves further evaluation for the treatment of HBV infection.
