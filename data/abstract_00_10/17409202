The combined disk assay has been used for detection of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing isolates. We have observed that the size of inhibition zones produced by many beta-lactam/metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor (IMBL) combinations may differ depending on the way that the combined disks were prepared. Among the 10 beta-lactam/IMBL combinations tested, only the imipenem/EDTA combination produced similar results.
