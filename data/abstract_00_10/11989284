The functional activity of neutrophils and macrophages and an immune response to sheep red blood cells decrease in mice with local staphylococcal infection in the early period. In the first 24 hours after contamination, the animals' neutrophils lose their capacity to produce immuno-stimulating agents, they begin secreting immunosuppressive factors. Administration of secretory products of activated neutrophils, the low-weight molecular peptide isolated from these cells to the induced animals restores the immunological responsiveness of the staphylococcus-infected animals, reduces the death of mice infected with S. aureus and S. typhimurium.
