OBJECTIVE: To identify the levels of antibiotic utilization and the resistance profiles of nosocomial bacteria, as well as the strategies to diminish resistance to antibiotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective (1994-1995) study was conducted in six tertiary level hospitals in Mexico City. RESULTS: A total of 86% antibiotic resistance was observed in these hospitals. The overall consumption of antibiotics per hospital ranged between 44 and 195 Defined Daily Doses/100 day-beds. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the components to frame an integral surveillance system aimed at improving the use of antibiotics and the quality of the bacterial resistance assessment in these hospitals.
