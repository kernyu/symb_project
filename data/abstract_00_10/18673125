Despite alarming data showing the ever increasing number of bacteria becoming resistant to different classes of antibiotics through various mechanisms, the carbapenems remain a unique class of antibiotics that possess the broadest spectrum against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic organisms. However, bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, carry mechanisms that can inactivate the carbapenems. This article gives a review of the carbapenems that are currently in clinical use as well as discusses the new carbapenems that are in clinical trials. These new carbapenems show promising potential to overcome the resistance against the presently existing carbapenems. The present article shows the recent patents using carbapenems as an effective antibiotic.
