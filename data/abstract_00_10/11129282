Efficient gene transfer of lymphocytes is extremely difficult. We have shown previously that induction of apoptosis may play a role in the gene transfer resistance of lymphocytes. Anti-CD3 antibody can be used as a surrogate for receptor-mediated gene transfer in T lymphocytes. However, anti-CD3 antibody has been shown to be the causative agent of apoptosis in receptor-mediated gene transfer. In this study, we show that blockage of apoptosis by addition of low-dose cyclosporine A can lead to normalization of elevated TNF-alpha secretion and to a significant increase in the proliferation rate of transfected lymphocytes. In contrast, this had no negative effect on cytotoxic activity of immunologic effector cells called cytokine-induced killer cells. Therefore, blockage of apoptosis should have an impact on the use of lymphocytes transfected with cytokine genes as immunologic effector cells in cancer gene therapy protocols.
