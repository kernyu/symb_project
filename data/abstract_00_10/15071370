PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we highlight some of the developments achieved over the past 2 years in the field of novel antimicrobial compounds. RECENT FINDINGS: Modification of existing compound classes to create more powerful compounds capable of overcoming pathogen resistance and the introduction of completely new classes of antibiotics and inhibitors of new bacterial targets or inhibitors of genes relating to virulence or pathogenesis are the strategies more commonly employed in pharmacologic research. Ketolides, oxazolidinones, streptogramins, glycylcyclines, and peptide deformylase inhibitors are among the most promising classes of antibiotics. Recently, several lines of research have documented that it is effective to target the infection process rather than killing bacteria. This is important because it is likely that such a therapeutic strategy could ablate infection without inducing resistance. SUMMARY: Emergence of resistance to the antibiotics currently employed in clinical practice is a continual stimulus for further research aimed at identifying novel antimicrobial compounds. These drugs will perhaps effectively fight against bacteria that now are scarcely controlled by the traditional antimicrobial agents. Health care personnel must appreciate that only judicious use of antimicrobial drugs will prevent the further uncontrolled spread of bacterial resistance. Implementation of reference guidelines would probably be an effective way to limit antibiotic misuse.
