The aim of this study was to compare epidemiological data with antibiotic susceptibility patterns, so as to characterize the risk of infection with a highly resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain. N. gonorrhoeae strains isolated in Sweden from February 1998 through January 1999 were tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Epidemiological data were received from each clinician reporting a case of gonorrhoea and these data were linked to the N. gonorrhoeae strains. A total of 348 N. gonorrhoeae isolates, representing 89% of all Swedish cases diagnosed during the 12-month period, were tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Of all isolates, 24% were beta-lactamase-producing, and 18% had decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (MIC>0.064 mg/l). All isolates were fully susceptible to ceftriaxone and spectinomycin. More than 99% of the isolates were fully susceptible to azithromycin. The antibiotic susceptibility varied with the places where patients were exposed to infection. When exposed in Asia, 63% of the isolates showed reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, compared with 0-8.5% of the isolates from patients exposed in other places (RR=8.5, P<0.001). Ciprofloxacin cannot be recommended as the first choice of treatment if the place of exposure was in Asia.
