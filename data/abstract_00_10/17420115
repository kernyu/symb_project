Recent publications were compared and analysed in addition to novel surveillance data to assess the hypothesis that fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter infections are causing more severe disease than susceptible infections. The available data did not support this hypothesis. There was no significant difference in duration of disease between susceptible and resistant infections. However, both for resistant and susceptible infections, disease symptoms were prolonged by on average 1-2 days for Campylobacter cases acquired during foreign travel. Nevertheless, the likelihood and duration of hospitalisation were not increased for cases related to foreign travel. These observations were confirmed by a new analysis of almost 11,000 cases. We conclude that fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter infections are not more severe than susceptible infections.
