Animals and plants make a variety of substances to prevent potentially lethal infections. These include small antibiotic proteins, or peptides, which target bacteria, fungi and viruses. Research into these peptides not only give us an insight into how we naturally prevent infections, but can also provide us with new drugs to treat the ever-increasing danger of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
