RNA interference has emerged as a powerful tool for the silencing of gene expression in animals and plants. It was reported recently that 21 nt synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specifically suppressed the expression of endogenous genes in several lines of mammalian cells. However, the efficacy of siRNAs is dependent on the presence of a specific target site within the target mRNA and it remains very difficult to predict the best or most effective target site. In this study, we demonstrate that siRNAs that have been generated in vitro by recombinant human Dicer (re-hDicer) significantly suppress not only the exogenous expression of a puromycin-resistance gene but also the endogenous expression of H-ras, c-jun and c-fos. In our system, selection of a target site is not necessary in the design of siRNAs. However, it is important to avoid homologous sequences within a target mRNA in a given protein family. Our diced siRNA system should be a powerful tool for the inactivation of genes in mammalian cells.
