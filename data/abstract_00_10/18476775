To evaluate nosocomial infections due to imipenem-resistant and imipenem-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a case-control study that included genotyping was performed. Hospitalization for more than 15 days was independently associated with infection with an imipenem-resistant organism. Sixty-seven percent of the imipenem-resistant isolates analyzed and 23% of the imipenem-susceptible isolates analyzed belonged to a single clone. Intervention led to a decrease in the number of infections due to imipenem-resistant and imipenem-susceptible P. aeruginosa.
