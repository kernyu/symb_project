Susceptibility to moxifloxacin, penicillin and erythromycin was determined for 592 invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae collected from 20 English hospitals participating in the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) during 2003. Resistance to moxifloxacin, penicillin and erythromycin was observed in 0.8%, 5.4% and 13% of the isolates, respectively. These results show that the large majority of pneumococci were susceptible to moxifloxacin in 2003, the year when it was licensed for clinical use in the UK.
