The occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius from skin and ear infections in a representative sample of dogs unexposed to antimicrobial treatment before sampling was examined. The obtained isolates were further examined for genetic polymorphism and genetic background of resistance. A total of 59 isolates of S. pseudintermedius originating from 96 samples of 91 dogs in five different regions in Norway were included in this study. Susceptibility testing was performed using a broth dilution method. Resistant isolates were subjected to polymerase chain reaction for detection of resistance genes. All isolates were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to examine the genetic polymorphism. In total, 19% of the isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents included. Resistance to penicillin was most prevalent (70%), followed by resistance to fusidic acid (49%) and oxytetracycline (42%). Resistance to quinolones or cephalosporins was not observed. Resistance to penicillin, tetracycline, and erythromycin was mediated by the blaZ beta-lactamase gene, the tetM gene, and the ermB gene, respectively. One of the fusidic acid-resistant isolates harbored a fusC gene, whereas the mechanisms involved in resistance in the other fusidic acid-resistant isolates remained unknown. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed a high genetic polymorphism of S. pseudintermedius. This study indicates that the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance is common among S. pseudintermedius from dogs unexposed to antimicrobial treatment before sampling, and that there is a high genetic polymorphism among S. pseudintermedius.
