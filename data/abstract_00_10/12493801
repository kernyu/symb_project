In vitro activities of six antimicrobial agents against 2966 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, isolated in Spain between 1983 and 2001, were determined. The percentages of intermediately susceptible and resistant isolates to penicillin (MIC > or = 0.12 mg/L) and tetracycline (MIC > or = 0.5 mg/L) were very high over the period of study. Strains intermediately susceptible to cefoxitin were identified at a variable percentage during the study. All N. gonorrhoeae isolates were susceptible to spectinomycin and ceftriaxone. Recently, resistance to ciprofloxacin has emerged.
