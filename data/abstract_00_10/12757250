Ivermectin is a potent antiparasitic drug and the first commercially available member of a new class of drugs (macrocyclic lactones) that has been approved for human use. Ivermectin has already proven to be highly effective in the elimination of river blindness as a public health burden. Side effects have been minor, and patient acceptance is good. Promising results in off-label applications for ectoparasitic infestations are increasingly important as resistance to topical therapy becomes more prevalent Ivermectin represents an advance in the therapeutic armamentarium and should be considered in appropriate cases.
