The efficacy and safety profile of meropenem were analyzed according to data collected from hospitalized pediatric patients aged 4 days to 20 years who had serious bacterial infections and were treated in a major teaching hospital in Taipei. Of the 53 patients enrolled, 47 were analyzed for clinical efficacy and 53 for safety. The satisfactory clinical response rate was 57% in lower respiratory tract infection, 58% in septicemia, 100% in complicated urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis, and central nervous system infection, 83% in skin and soft tissue infection, and 93% in intra-abdominal infection. Eleven (21%) patients experienced adverse events related to meropenem. The most commonly observed adverse reactions were elevated hepatic enzymes (7.5%), increased alkaline phosphatase (3.8%), and thrombocytosis (3.8%). There was no meropenem-related seizure, withdrawal, or death. The results of this study suggested that meropenem is well tolerated even in young infants, and is effective in treating serious childhood bacterial infection. However, this study also identified a proportion of hospitalized pediatric patients with isolates that were resistant to meropenem. The trends in meropenem resistance among nosocomially acquired bacteria should be monitored closely.
