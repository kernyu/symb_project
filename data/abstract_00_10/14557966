Gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin are the newest fluoroquinolones and show excellent in vitro activity against a wide variety of respiratory tract pathogens, many gram-negative aerobic organisms, and Bacteroides fragilis. These agents may be administered as oral and/or intravenous formulations with excellent bioavailability. The pharmacodynamics of these 3 new fluoroquinolones is more favorable than that of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin for Streptococcus pneumoniae. All 3 agents are approved for the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and community-acquired pneumonia. In addition, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin are approved for the treatment of sinusitis. The toxicity of these 3 agents appears to be similar to that of the other fluoroquinolones in terms of gastrointestinal and central nervous system disturbances. All 3 agents have a low risk of phototoxicity, but gemifloxacin is associated with an increased risk of skin rash that is not a photoreaction. These agents can be useful for treatment of bacterial respiratory tract infections in patients who are allergic to beta-lactams, but caution must be exercised to avoid the potential for selection of widespread resistance, which may occur with indiscriminate use.
