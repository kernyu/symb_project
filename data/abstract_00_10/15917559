An Escherichia coli strain, isolated from wild reindeer in a remote mountain area, contained a class 1 integron with two unusual features: a group II intron and a cassette with homology to a superintegron cassette. Alignments indicate that attC sites of gene cassettes may be insertion sites for introns.
