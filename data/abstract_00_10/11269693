Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been used experimentally as a dietary supplement to increase lean body weight and to modulate inflammation in a variety of animal species. In addition, human use of dietary CLA as a supplement to regulate body fat has received both scientific and public attention. No reports have been published regarding the effects of dietary CLA on antimicrobial resistance. In this study, we provide evidence that feeding CLA for up to 4 wk does not alter host defense against Listeria monocytogenes in mice. These findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of CLA do not impair cellular immunity to this intracellular pathogen.
