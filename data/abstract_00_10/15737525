The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Mobiluncus species isolated from specimens collected from Turkish women with gynaecological infections. Mobiluncus species were isolated on enriched Schaedler agar and RLK agar plates under anaerobic conditions. The MICs of various antibiotics were evaluated using an agar dilution procedure. The prevalence of Mobiluncus species isolated from vulvo-vaginal abscesses, endometrial smears, salpingitis and bacterial vaginosis was 2%, 4.7%, 3.8% and 49%, respectively. Mobiluncus isolates were only resistant to metronidazole (81% resistance). The isolation rate of M. curtisii was higher than M. mulieris in Turkish women with bacterial vaginosis, vulvo-vaginal abscesses, endometritis or salpingitis.
