Antiviral agents are the most effective treatment option for influenza. Two classes of drugs are available, the adamantanes and the neuraminidase inhibitors. Neuraminidase inhibitors were a major breakthrough in the treatment options for influenza and were licensed in the year 2000. They have an excellent safety profile and effectively reduce viral shedding, symptoms, duration of illness, secondary complications, hospitalizations and consumption of antibiotics. Patients have also shown a more rapid return to everyday activities. The therapeutic efficacy is highly dependent on the time between the onset of symptoms and the starting of therapy. Very early initiation is primordial to have a maximal effect. Neuraminidase inhibitors are also effective in primary and secondary prophylaxis during epidemic influenza. They are a key point in the pandemic preparedness. Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors does occur but has not become an extensive problem so far.
