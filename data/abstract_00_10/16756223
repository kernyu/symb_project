The 'Stichting Werkgroep Antibioticabeleid' (SWAB; Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy) develops evidence-based guidelines for the use of antibiotics in hospitalised adults. This guideline on acute infectious diarrhoea (AID) concerns the antibiotic treatment of acute infectious inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, manifesting primarily as diarrhoea. AID can be subdivided into community-acquired diarrhoea, traveller's diarrhoea and hospital-acquired (nosocomial) diarrhoea. In the first 2 categories, the need for antibiotic treatment is generally restricted to individuals with severe illness, dysentery or a predisposition to complications. High rates of primary fluoroquinolone resistance can be found in human Campylobacter isolates from the Netherlands and from other parts of the world. Therefore, if antibiotic treatment is necessary for community-acquired AID or AID in travellers returning to the Netherlands, it is advised to use oral azithromycin for 3 days as empirical treatment. If intravenous treatment is necessary, the combination of ciprofloxacin and erythromycin for 5-7 days may be considered. As soon as the identity of the causative organism is known, antimicrobial treatment should be tailored accordingly.
