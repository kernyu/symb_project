OBJECTIVE: To analyze and compare the mutations in two different regions of the katG gene, which is responsible for isoniazid (INH) resistance. METHODS: We analyzed 97 multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated in cultures of sputum samples obtained from the Professor Helio Fraga Referral Center, in Brasilia, Brazil. Another 6 INH-sensitive strains did not present mutations and were included as controls. We used PCR to amplify two regions of the katG gene (GenBank accession no. U06258)-region 1, (from codon 1 to codon 119) and region 2 (from codon 267 to codon 504)-which were then sequenced in order to identify mutations. RESULTS: Seven strains were resistant to INH and did not contain mutations in either region. Thirty strains carried mutations in region 1, which was characterized by a high number of deletions, especially at codon 4 (24 strains). Region 2 carried 83 point mutations, especially at codon 315, and there was a serine-to-threonine (AGC-to-ACC) substitution in 73 of those cases. The analysis of region 2 allowed INH resistance to be diagnosed in 81.4% of the strains. Nine strains had mutations exclusively in region 1, which allowed the proportion of INH-resistant strains identified to be increased to 90.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The number of mutations at codon 315 was high, which is consistent with cases described in Brazil and in other countries, and the analysis of region 1 resulted in a 9.2% increase in the rate at which mutations were identified.
