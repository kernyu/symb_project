We report the antiretroviral activity of stavudine-5'-(p-bromophenyl methoxyalaninyl phosphate) (stampidine [STAMP]), a novel aryl phosphate derivative of stavudine, against primary clinical human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates. STAMP inhibited each one of nine clinical HIV-1 isolates of non-B envelope subtype and 20 genotypically and phenotypically nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant HIV-1 isolates at subnanomolar to low-nanomolar concentrations.
