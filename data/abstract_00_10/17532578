Slime production, principal virulence factor of Staphylococcus epidermidis associated with catheter-related infections is mediated by icaADBC operon wich expression is subject to phase variation. Reversible transposition of IS256 element into this operon is one of the most important mechanisms of biofilm phenotypic variation. Our study compared 28 S. epidermidis strains from catheter-related infection to 28 strains from nasal carriage concerning slime production on Congo red agar plate and ica genes and IS256 presence by PCR. ica operon was present among all slime-producing strains, and was absent among slime-negative strains. Only 79% of ica-positive strains were slime producers and no insertion of IS256 element was detected inside ica genes. A significative difference was found between catheter-related infections strains and commensal ones in terms of oxacillin (67,8 versus 35,7%) and ofloxacin resistance (75 versus 35,7%), slime production (64,2 versus 28,5%), phase variability (46,4 versus 7,1%) and ica genes presence (82,1 versus 35,7%). Our study demonstrates the role of ica genes, of phenotypic variability of slime production and antibiotic multiresistance as virulence factors of S. epidermidis associated with catheter-related infections; it confirms also the complexity and the diversity of regulation mechanisms implicated in biofilm formation.
