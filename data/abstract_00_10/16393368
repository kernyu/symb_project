This study investigated why the susceptible or resistance phenotype to the nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus was lost when susceptible (C57BL/6) and resistant (Balb/c) strains of mice were housed together in indoor arenas with continuous transmission of the parasite larvae present in peat trays (Scott, 1991). First, both strains expressed their normal phenotype when given a controlled challenge while living in arenas, and when experimentally infected with only 5 parasite larvae. To test whether chronic exposure to peat altered the resistance phenotype, mice were given a challenge infection while living on peat. C57BL/6 mice living on peat had higher egg production and higher worm numbers than Balb/c mice, except at 2 months post-challenge. Finally, natural transmission rates were increased in arena experiments through either regular replacement of arena mice with naive mice or direct introduction of additional larvae. A transient difference in infection levels between strains was detected in response to a modest increase in transmission whereas a 10-fold increase in transmission allowed C57BL/6 mice to exhibit the typical profile of high egg production and elevated worm numbers. These data indicate that C57BL/6 mice are less able to regulate parasite numbers at high transmission rates compared with lower transmission rates.
