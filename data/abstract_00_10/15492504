The eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is a key regulator of protein translation whose function is activated by the Akt and Ras proto-oncogenic signal transduction pathways. eIF4E enhances the translation of mRNAs encoding several genes involved in tumorigenesis and acts as a proto-oncogene, in vitro, when overexpressed in immortalized cells. Importantly, eIF4E is frequently found overexpressed in human cancers of multiple histological origins. However, in vivo evidence of the eIF4E neoplastic potential was lacking until now. Here we discuss recent findings that demonstrate eIF4E's oncogenic role in vivo through direct genetic approaches in the mouse, and identify novel oncogenic functions for this initiation factor in cooperative tumorigenesis and response to therapy.
