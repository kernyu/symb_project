Spread of multi-drug resistant malaria in the endemic areas has made malaria control more difficult. Thus, WHO recommends combination therapy for the treatment of malaria. The aim of combination therapy is to improve efficacy and to reduce the incidence of resistance development to the each component of the combination. Particularly, the combination with artemisinin derivatives shows good outcome in Thailand where high resistance for mefloquine has already been found. We report the first case of falciparum malaria, successfully treated with Artemether-Lumefantrine in Japan. Artemether-Lumefantrine is a newly developed artemisinin-based combination agent for the treatment of uncomplicated multi-drug resistant malaria. This drug has proved highly effective and well tolerated by some clinical trials abroad. This Japanese female case showed a good clinical course without any side effect.
