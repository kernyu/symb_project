Nosocomial device-related infections with Gram-positive cocci and their resistance to vancomycin are of increasing occurrence. We examined clinical isolates of relatively avirulent coagulase-negative staphylococci for their resistance to vancomycin and for their capabilities to adhere in vitro to medical grade silicone. Vancomycin resistance was found in 9 of 20 isolates, but there was no correlation between adherence capacity to silicone in the absence of vancomycin and vancomycin resistance for a given strain. Vancomycin in the medium, adsorbed to the surface of medical grade silicone or adsorbed on nongrowing cells, reduced adherence of representative Staphylococcus epidermidis to medical grade silicone.
