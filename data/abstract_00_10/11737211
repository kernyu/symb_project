Clotrimazole has been shown to have potent anti-malarial activity in vitro, one possible mechanism being inhibition of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) export from the infected human red blood cells or from the parasite itself. Efflux of GSSG from normal erythrocytes is mediated by a high affinity glutathione S-conjugate transporter. This paper shows that transport of the model substrate, 3 microm dinitrophenyl S-glutathione, across erythrocyte membranes is inhibited by multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1)-specific antibody, QCRL-3, strongly suggesting that the high affinity transport is mediated by MRP1. The rates of transport observed with membrane vesicles prepared from erythrocytes or from multidrug resistant tumour cells show a similar pattern of responses to applied reduced glutathione, GSSG and MRP1 inhibitors (indomethacin, MK571) further supporting the conclusion that the high affinity transporter is MRP1. In both erythrocytes and MRP1-expressing tumour cells, MRP1-associated transport is inhibited by clotrimazole over the range 2-20 microm, and the inhibitory effect leads to increases in accumulation of MRP1 substrates, vincristine and calcein, and decreases in calcein efflux from intact MRP1-expressing human tumour cells. It also results in increased sensitivity to daunorubicin of the multidrug resistant cells, L23/R but not the sensitive parent L23/P cells. These results demonstrate that clotrimazole can inhibit the MRP1 which is present in human erythrocytes, an effect that may contribute to, though not fully account for, its anti-malarial action.
