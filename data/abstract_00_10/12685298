OBJECTIVE: To assess the views of community physicians on management of acute otitis media (AOM) without antibiotics and their willingness to support research on this issue. METHODS: Community physicians who admit to a children's hospital were surveyed using a questionnaire containing questions on current issues in AOM management and their willingness to support research on management of AOM without antibiotics. RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of the surveys were returned. All respondents report concern about antibiotic resistant bacteria. Sixty-three percent treat otitis media with effusion with antibiotics and 68% give prophylactic antibiotics for recurrent otitis media. Thirty-five percent consider management of AOM without antibiotics as a possible alternative management practice. Forty-five percent of the respondents are willing to support research in this practice and 46% need more information. CONCLUSIONS: Surveyed physicians indicate concern about antibiotic resistance and a willingness to support further research on the initial management of acute otitis media without antibiotics.
