Linezolid in combination with ertapenem showed in vitro synergy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. We confirmed this interaction in vivo by using a rabbit endocarditis experimental model and simulation of the human pharmacokinetics in animals for both antibiotics. Linezolid plus ertapenem exhibited highly synergistic activity in vivo after 4 days of treatment.
