Near instantaneous detection of pathogens from clinical material, combined with simultaneous prediction of their antimicrobial resistance profiles, would revolutionize the impact of microbiology on the management of infection. Array-based assays allow a range of characteristics to be rapidly and simultaneously determined. At present these systems have found their primary role as research tools for the monitoring of mRNA expression in the form of DNA microarrays or 'chips'. As fabrication costs reduce and validated targeted arrays are developed, it is inevitable they will be used for more routine applications. Microfluidics offers the exciting possibility of combining purification, amplification and detection in a single disposable device; microarrays are particularly suitable for use within these systems. Arrays will become an important tool for clinical diagnostics.
