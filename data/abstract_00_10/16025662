INTRODUCTION: Simplification of combined antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients is possible, but virological success can be compromised by the development or emergence of resistant viruses. CASE: Worsening renal functioning in a patient under successful combination antiretroviral therapy resulted led to the replacement of indinavir by abacavir. Eight weeks later, his viral load rose and he developed a mutant virus resistant to all the nucleoside analogs. DISCUSSION: Our case report illustrates the danger of streamlining combined antiretroviral therapy composed only of nucleoside analogs in patients already successfully treated with nucleoside analogs, by exposing them to the risk of the emergence of a mutant virus.
