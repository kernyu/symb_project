BACKGROUND: Differences in subtypes, hepatitis B early antigen (HBeAg)-negative variants, and drug resistance mutations all seem to influence the clinical and therapeutic outcome in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Information available on the prevalence and distribution of distinct HBV variants in HIV-positive patients is scarce. METHODS: All HIV-infected patients with persistent serum hepatitis B surface antigen and detectable HBV viremia were identified in a reference HIV clinic located in Madrid, Spain. HBV load, subtypes, precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) variants, and lamivudine (LAM) resistance mutations were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 81 HBV/HIV-coinfected patients (4.1%) were identified in a population of 1968 HIV-positive patients. Plasma specimens with detectable HBV viremia could be obtained from 62 subjects, and this was the study population that underwent further virologic characterization. HBV genotype distribution was as follows: A (n = 27), D (n = 27), E (n = 1), F (n = 2), and G (n = 3). Two patients had mixed HBV genotypes (A/E and A/F). HBV subtype A was predominant (74%) among patients infected through sexual contact, whereas HBV-D was most frequent (74%) among intravenous drug users (P < 0.001). PC/BCP mutants were more frequent in patients with HBV-D than in those with HBV-A (63% vs. 18%; P < 0.01). Median time on LAM was 40 months; patients with HBV-A tended to show LAM resistance mutations more often (53% vs. 44%) and to develop them earlier (35 vs. 45 months) than patients with HBV-D. The dual L180M + M204V/I mutant was the predominant resistance pattern, although a triple rt173V + 180M + 204V, which acts as a vaccine escape mutant, was found in 1 individual. In the multivariate analysis, patients with LAM resistance mutations were significantly more frequently HBeAg-positive and older than individuals with wild-type HBV. Hepatitis-delta was recognized in 13 (21%) of these 62 HBV viremic patients, with no association with specific HBV variants. CONCLUSION: Risk transmission group, age, and positive serum HBeAg are the main determinants of distinct HBV virologic variants, including HBV genotypes and LAM-resistant mutants, in HBV/HIV-coinfected patients.
