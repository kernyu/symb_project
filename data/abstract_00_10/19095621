Codon recognition by aminoacyl-tRNA on the ribosome triggers a process leading to GTP hydrolysis by elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and release of aminoacyl-tRNA into the A site of the ribosome. The nature of this signal is largely unknown. Here, we present genetic evidence that a specific set of direct interactions between ribosomal protein S12 and aminoacyl-tRNA, together with contacts between S12 and 16S rRNA, provide a pathway for the signaling of codon recognition to EF-Tu. Three novel amino acid substitutions, H76R, R37C, and K53E in Thermus thermophilus ribosomal protein S12, confer resistance to streptomycin. The streptomycin-resistance phenotypes of H76R, R37C, and K53E are all abolished by the mutation A375T in EF-Tu. A375T confers resistance to kirromycin, an antibiotic freezing EF-Tu in a GTPase activated state. H76 contacts aminoacyl-tRNA in ternary complex with EF-Tu and GTP, while R37 and K53 are involved in the conformational transition of the 30S subunit occurring upon codon recognition. We propose that codon recognition and domain closure of the 30S subunit are signaled through aminoacyl-tRNA to EF-Tu via these S12 residues.
