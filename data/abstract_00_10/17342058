In this study we examined the multi-drug resistance profiles of the tetracycline (TC) resistant genus Vibrio to determine its susceptibility to two beta-lactams, ampicillin (ABPC), and mecillinam (MPC), as well as to macrolide, erythromycin (EM). The results showed various patterns of resistance among strains that were isolated from very close geographical areas during the same year, suggesting diverse patterns of drug resistance in environmental bacteria from this area. In addition, the cross-resistance patterns suggested that the resistance determinants among Vibrio spp. are acquired differently within the sediment and seawater environments.
