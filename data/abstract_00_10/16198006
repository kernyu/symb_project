A rapid and accurate minor groove binder (MGB) real-time PCR is described for detection lamivudine resistance mutations in hepatitis B virus. The real-time PCR was compared with direct Sanger sequencing in 53 clinical patients samples, the results of the real-time PCR correlate with the nucleotide sequence and the assay has the advantage of detecting a mixture of quasi-species with higher sensitivity than sequencing. As a simple, easy, rapid, accurate and high throughout method, MGB real-time PCR assay should be useful for detecting lamivudine resistance variants during lamivudine therapy in clinical settings.
