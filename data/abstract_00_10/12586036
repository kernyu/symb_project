Aminoglycosides remain as a efficacious class of antimicrobials, commonly used in the clinical practice. In spite of the existence of several mechanisms of resistance, they continue being active against most of the aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. Currently, although aminoglycosides may be used as monotherapy in the urinary tract infections, they are mainly used in combination with b-lactam antibiotics in severe infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli. The knowledge about the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of aminoglycosides has suggested their use in an once-daily dosing regimen. This dosing has shown as efficacious as multiple-daily dosing regimen in several studies, which also have shown a trend toward a lower toxicity. Among the adverse events, nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity require a careful evaluation during its administration.
