Intrathecal chemotherapy is integral to curing childhood leukemia; however, bioavailability is limited by the blood-brain barrier. Recently FDA-approved, intrathecal liposomal cytarabine (ITlipAC) increases drug concentration over time with fewer invasive procedures. We present a series of 4 children, including 2 infants, with relapsed central nervous system leukemia who went into remission using ITlipAC, with a review of the literature reporting ITlipAC use in children with relapsed leukemia. Drug-attributable side effects were observed more frequently in children with preexisting neurologic conditions and with adult dosing. Combined with other pediatric reports, our experience supports the efficacy of ITlipAC in pediatric and infant leukemic meningitis.
