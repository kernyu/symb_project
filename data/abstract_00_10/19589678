A series of honokiol analogues were synthesized by modifying the 5- and/or 3'-position(s) of honokiol to assess their anti-tumor effects. Some compounds exerted more potent anti-proliferative activities than those of honokiol on K562 leukemia cells, A549 alveolar basal epithelial cells, SPC-A1 adenocarcinoma cells and A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells in vitro. Compounds 2b, 3a, and 3c displayed most potent anti-proliferative activities against these tested cell strains and their anti-drug resistance effects were evaluated in vitro on cisplatin-resistant A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells. The structure-activity relationship was also proposed.
