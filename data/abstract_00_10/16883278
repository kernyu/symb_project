There is no doubt that on a global basis, Haemonchus contortus is by far the most important parasite of small ruminants (sheep and goats). This is particularly more so now, with the development of high levels of resistance to both the broad and narrow spectrum anthelmintic drugs in H. contortus throughout the world. Epidemiological studies describe the lower environmental limits for haemonchosis to occur in sheep, as being a mean monthly temperature of 18C and approximately 50mm rainfall. Thus it has been generally recognised that H. contortus is a problem parasite restricted to the warm, wet countries where sheep and goats are raised. However, recent evidence shows that this parasite is apparently common even in northern Europe. Thus the need for sustainable control strategies for H. contortus is becoming much more pressing. This report highlights two examples of sustainable and highly efficient control programmes for H. contortus, that can be implemented in regions at the extremes of its geographic range (Malaysia and Sweden), where the authors have had direct involvement.
