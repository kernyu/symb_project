Antimicrobial susceptibility of 13 antimicrobial drugs for the injection and O-group antigen serotype were measured for the 766 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains that had been isolated from various clinical materials in 29 facilities in the Hyogo prefecture from April to September in 2004. Metallo beta-lactamase detection was also performed. The antimicrobial activity was excellent in the order of GM, MEPM, AMK, CPFX and CAZ. Susceptible category of the breakpoint by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (CLSI/NCCLS) was excellent in the order of AMK, GM, PIPC, CZOP, and MEPM. As for the susceptibility of Carbapenem, it is confirmed that susceptible of MEPM was detected in 47 strains (36.4%) and metallo beta-lactamase producing P. aeruginosa was in 3 strains (0.4%) and multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa were in 7 strains only (0.9%) among 129 strains of the IPM resistant (I or R). The results of the susceptibility test against P. aeruginosa were different in each facility, but there were several stocks having the identical O-antigen serotype and anti-biogram pattern in some facilities. The nosocomial infection measures including the antimicrobial propriety use are necessary.
