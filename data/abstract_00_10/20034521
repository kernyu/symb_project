Full-length hepatitis B virus (HBV) reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences were amplified and sequenced among 192 nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)-naive Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B. Deduced amino acids (AAs) at 42 previously reported potential NA resistance (NAr) mutation positions in RT region were analyzed. Patients were found with either B-genotype (28.65%) or C-genotype (71.35%) infections. Rt53, rt91, rt124, rt134, rt221, rt224, rt238 and rt256 were identified as B- and C-genotype-dependent polymorphic AA positions. AA substitutions at 11 classical NAr mutation positions, i.e. rt80, rt169, rt173, rt180, rt181, rt184, rt194, rt202, rt204, rt236 and rt250, were not detected. However, potential NAr mutations were found in 30.73% (59/192) isolates, which involved 18 positions including rt53, rt207, rt229, rt238 and rt256, etc. The concomitant AA changes of HBsAg occurred in 16.67% (32/192) isolates including sG145R mutation. One-third of mutation positions were located in functional RT domains (e.g. rt207 and rt233), A-B interdomains (overlapping HBsAg 'a' determinant and showing most concomitant immune-associated mutations) and non-A-B interdomains (e.g. rt191 and rt213), respectively. Genotypes B and C each showed several preferred positions to mutate. These results might provide insights into understanding the evolution and selection basis of NAr HBV strains under antiviral therapy.
