OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular mechanism of transferable multiple-antibiotic resistance in extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) producing isolates. METHODS: Antibiotics susceptibility was tested by E-test method, and multi-resistance plasmids were screened and isolated by extracting transformant plasmids. Inserted gene Cassettes of class 1 integron were amplified and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Eight of the nine ESBL-producing plasmids were found to comprise class 1 integron sequence, of them 7 harbored 1 or 2 antibiotic resistant gene cassettes which encoding resistance to aminoglycosides (aacA4, aadA2 or aadA5), trimethoprim (dhfrA12 or dfrA17), rifampicin (arr-3) and chloramphenicol (cmlA6). The function of these gene cassettes corresponded to the resistance profiles of their electro-transformants. CONCLUSION: Multi-resistance gene cassettes located on plasmids and mediated by class 1 integron may play an important role in causing the development and dissemination of multiple-antibiotic resistance in ESBL-producing clinical isolates.
