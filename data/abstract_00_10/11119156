Strains of Lactobacillus reuteri and Lact. rhamnosus are used as probiotics in man and animal. The aim of this study was to determine whether the glycopeptide resistance in these lactobacilli has a similar genetic basis as in enterococci. Five Lact. reuteri strains and one Lact. rhamnosus, as well as four Enterococcus control strains, were probed for the vanA gene cluster, the vanB gene and the vanC gene by PCR and Southern hybridization, and DNA/DNA hybridization. Their resistance and plasmid patterns were also investigated. All Lactobacillus strains were resistant to vancomycin but susceptible to a broad range of antibiotics. Four of the Lactobacillus strains (including the Lact. rhamnosus strain) did not harbour any plasmid and two of them contained five and 6 plasmid bands respectively. None of the Lactobacillus strains possessed the vanA, vanB or vanC gene. These findings indicate that the glycopeptide resistance of the Lactobacillus strains analysed is different from the enterococcal type. The study provides reassurance on the safety of the Lactobacillus strains used as probiotics with regard to their vancomycin resistance.
