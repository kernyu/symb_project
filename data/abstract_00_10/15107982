Malaria prophylaxis is often discussed among travelers. Different recommendations are confusing. This is partially due to the availability of drugs in different countries and to the fact that few evidence-based data exist. German and Swiss experts try to counteract the resulting uncertainties by providing almost identical recommendations for malaria prevention and management. Many factors influence the malaria risk. Travel style, duration and season of travel, the transmitting anopheline mosquitoes, the causative Plasmodia and resistance of the parasites against antimalarial drugs influence the recommendations. Malaria protection consists of various components. Exposure prophylaxis substantially reduces the risk of infection. Drugs for chemoprophylaxis and standby emergency medications are available in industrialized countries. If malaria infection is readily diagnosed, the infection can always be successfully treated.
