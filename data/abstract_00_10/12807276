The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program was initiated in January 1997 and was designed to monitor the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance for both nosocomial and community-acquired infections globally by using validated, reference-quality identification and susceptibility testing methods performed in a central laboratory. Consecutive bacterial or fungal isolates, deemed clinically significant by local criteria, are forwarded to the local reference laboratory from various study objectives. The major objectives include blood stream infections, community-acquired respiratory tract infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis), pneumonias in hospitalised patients, skin and soft tissue infections, and urinary tract isolates from hospitalised patients. In 2001, special objectives were introduced to examine gastroenteritis pathogens and beta-haemolytic streptococcal isolates. Over 22 nations participate in SENTRY surveillance globally. The Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide has been the reference centre for the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa since 1998, and three other Australian institutions, from Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide, are part of the global network. All isolates received from our region are tested against up to 29 antimicrobial agents using custom-made broth microdilution panels. The data generated from SENTRY allows Australia to compare our antimicrobial resistance patterns and trends with our regional neighbours.
