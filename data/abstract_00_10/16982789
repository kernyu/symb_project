Among 10 subjects colonized with Escherichia coli isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, the median duration of colonization following hospital discharge was 80 days (range, 8 to 172 days). Colonization was longer for isolates demonstrating organic-solvent tolerance than for isolates that were not organic-solvent tolerant (151 versus 29 days, respectively; P = 0.07) but was not associated with other resistance mechanisms, demographics, or antibiotic use.
