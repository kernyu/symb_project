The present work examines the effect of membrane lipid composition on activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) and cell death following oxidative stress. When subjected to 50 microM docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6 n-3), cellular phospholipids of OLN 93 cells, a clonal line of oligodendroglia origin low in DHA, were enriched with this polyunsaturated fatty acid. In the presence of 1 mM N,N-dimethylethanolamine (dEa) a new phospholipid species analog was formed in lieu of phosphatidylcholine. Exposure of DHA-enriched cells to 0.5 mM H2O2, caused sustained activation of ERK up to 24 h. At this time massive apoptotic cell death was demonstrated by ladder and TUNEL techniques. H2O2-induced stress applied to dEa or DHA/dEa co-supplemented cells showed only a transient ERK activation and no cell death after 24 h. Moreover, while ERK was rapidly translocated into the nucleus in DHA-enriched cells, dEa supplements completely blocked ERK nuclear translocation. This study suggests that H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death is associated with prolonged ERK activation and nuclear translocation in DHA-enriched OLN 93 cells, while both phenomena are prevented by dEa supplements. Thus, the membrane lipid composition ultimately modulates ERK activation and translocation and therefore can promote or prevent apoptotic cell death.
