The outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) of bacteria function as the dynamic interface between the bacterium and its surroundings and are involved in maintenance of cell structure, binding a variety of substances, adhesion to other cells, and regulation of transport of both nutrients and bactericidal agents. There is a vast amount of information about aerobic OMPs and their roles in immunogenicity, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance. Knowledge about OMPs in anaerobic bacteria is much sparser. Genetic data present in data banks regarding aerobic porins are not readily helpful in identifying or analyzing anaerobic porins because of the large phylogenetic distance between the aerobic and anaerobic organisms. We recently identified and sequenced the genes for both a porin protein complex and an OmpA protein in Bacteroides fragilis, and the data are summarized here. Also, recent information is presented about similar OMPs found in other gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides distasonis, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium.
