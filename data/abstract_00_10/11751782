Forty-five cutaneous propionibacterial isolates from six European cities were found to be highly resistant to all macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B antibiotics, including the ketolide telithromycin. This contrasts with previously documented phenotypes associated with 23S rRNA mutations. Sequencing of the resistance determinant showed it to be erm(X) of corynebacterial origin located on the composite transposon Tn5432.
