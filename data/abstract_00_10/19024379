OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in phlegm specimens of positive patients, so as to provide evidences for the nosocomial infection control. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 211 hospitalized patients who were MRSA-positive in their phlegm specimens in PUMC Hospital from January 2005 to October 2007. RESULTS: Among the 211 patients, 196 (92.9%) had received antibiotics three months before the detection of MRSA, and 128 (60.7%) had received more than three antibiotics. Over 90% of MRSA were resistant to levofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and gentamicin, and 73.9% were resistant to rifampicin. CONCLUSIONS: Improper use of antibiotics should be avoided. Vancomycin is the first choice for MRSA treatment.
