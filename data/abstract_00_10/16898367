SETTING: Provincial tuberculosis (TB) services, British Columbia, Canada. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the risk of drug resistance among foreign-born TB patients and to identify risk factors associated with drug resistance. DESIGN: Using the provincial TB database, we examined all culture-positive foreign-born TB patients for the years 1990-2001. The risk of having a drug-resistant isolate was estimated according to country and region of origin. RESULTS: Of 1940 foreign-born patients identified, 247 (12.7%, 95%CI 11.3-14.3) cases had isolates resistant to at least one of the first-line drugs, with 160 (8.3%) isolates showing monoresistance, 24 (1.2%) multidrug resistance (resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin) and 63 (3.3%) polyresistance (resistance to two or more drugs, excluding MDR). Country-specific analysis showed that immigrants from Vietnam (adjusted OR 2.12, 95%CI 1.37-3.27) and the Philippines (adjusted OR 1.71, 95%CI 1.10-2.66) had a significantly higher risk of resistance than other immigrants. In addition, the risk was the highest for younger TB patients and patients with reactivated disease (adjusted OR 2.12, 95%CI 1.09-4.09). CONCLUSION: The risk of drug resistance was the highest among foreign-born patients from Vietnam and the Philippines. These findings should assist clinicians in prescribing and tailoring anti-tuberculosis regimens for immigrants more appropriately.
