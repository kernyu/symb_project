Bacterial multidrug efflux pumps operate by periplasmic recruitment and opening of TolC family outer membrane exit ducts by cognate inner membrane translocases. Directed evolution of active hybrid pumps was achieved by challenging a library of mutated, shuffled TolC variants to adapt to the non-cognate Pseudomonas MexAB translocase, and confer resistance to the efflux substrate novobiocin. Amino acid substitutions in MexAB-adapted TolC variants that endowed high resistance were recreated independently, and revealed that MexAB-adaptation was conferred only by substitutions located in the lower alpha-helical barrel of TolC, specifically the periplasmic equatorial domain and entrance coiled coils. These changes converge to the native MexAB partner OprM, and indicate an interface key to the function and diversity of efflux pumps.
