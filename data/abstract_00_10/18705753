The multi-drug resistance (MDR) could be caused by the over-expression of adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporters such as p-glycoprotein, thereby resulting in the efflux of anti-cancer drugs from the cells. An anti-resistant stealthy liposomal vincristine plus quinacrine was defined in this study. Human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 and MDR K562 cells were included for comparisons. Anti-tumor activity studies were performed on female BALB/c nude mice with MDR K562 cell xenografts. Results showed that quinacrine was effective in reversing the resistance in the MDR K562 cells, and enhanced the anti-tumor effect of vincristine in K562 cells. The caspase-9 and -3 activities in the MDR K562 and K562 cells were increased with the dose rise of quinacrine. In the MDR K562 cell xenografts in mice, the anti-resistant tumor effect of the stealthy liposomal vincristine plus quinacrine was evidently observed. The enhanced anti-tumor effects of vincristine by quinacrine in the resistant/non-resistant K562 cells could be because of the direct injury and the potentiating apoptotic effect of vincristine via activating the initiator caspase-9 and subsequently the effector caspase-3, and the long circulatory effect of stealthy liposomes. The stealthy liposomal encapsulation of vincristine plus quinacrine could be a potential therapeutic approach for resistant human leukemia.
