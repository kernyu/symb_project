We have previously shown that whereas T-cells from normal individuals undergo accumulation of p53 and apoptosis when treated with the genotoxic agent Actinomycin D (ActD), those from Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) and Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) patients resist ActD-induced apoptosis [1]. We have now found similar resistance by the p53-null Jurkat T-cell line and by siRNA p53-knockdown normal T-cells. This evidence that ActD initiates a p53-dependent apoptotic responce prompted us to look for defective p53 accumulation by AT and NBS T-cells. Surprisingly the total p53 level was only slightly reduced compared to normal T cells but its intracellular localization was highly defective: p53 was poorly accumulated in the cytosol and nearly undetectable in mitochondria. In accordance with the dependence of ActD-induced apoptosis on a mitochondrial p53 function, in control T-cells specific inhibition of mitochondrial p53 translocation with mu pifithrin reduced apoptosis by 86%, whereas treatment with alpha pifithrin, which blocks p53-mediated transcription, had no effect. We also showed that nuclear export is not required for mitochondrial p53 translocation. Observation of an altered p53 ubiquitination pattern and Mdm2 accumulation in ActD-treated AT and NBS T-cells provided a mechanistic link to their defective extranuclear p53 localization. Our results disclose an undescribed defect in mitochondrial p53 accumulation in AT and NBS T-cells that makes them resistant to apoptosis following unrepairable DNA damage.
