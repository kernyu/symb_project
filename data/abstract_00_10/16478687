Despite advances in chemotherapy and the BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) vaccine, tuberculosis remains a significant infectious disease. Although it can be cured, the therapy takes at least 6-9 months, and the laborious and lengthy treatment brings with it dangers of noncompliance, significant toxicity and drug resistance. The increasing emergence of drug resistance and the problem of mycobacterial persistence highlight the need to develop novel TB drugs that are active against drug resistant bacteria but, more importantly, kill persistent bacteria and shorten the length of treatment. Recent new and exciting developments in tuberculosis drug discovery show good promise of a possible revolution in the chemotherapy of tuberculosis.
