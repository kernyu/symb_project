The staphylococci are an ever-present threat in our world, capable of causing a wide range of infections, and are a persistent presence in the clinical environment. As the number of antimicrobial compounds effective against staphylococci decreases, because of the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance, there is a growing need for novel therapeutic molecules. Intra and inter-species communication (quorum sensing) is a biologically significant phenomenon that has been associated with virulence, intracellular survival, and biofilm formation. Quorum sensing molecules of staphylococci and other species (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) can inhibit virulence factor production and/or growth of staphylococci, leading to the possibility that interference with staphylococcal quorum-sensing systems could be a way of controlling the diverse infections caused by the staphylococci. In this article, we discuss the potential of quorum-sensing systems of staphylococci as therapeutic targets.
