INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and dissemination of carbapenem-resistant and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from blood-stream samples (2000-2005) that were collected from patients admitted to the Institute of Pediatric Oncology, UNIFESP (IOP-GRAACC). METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-six P. aeruginosa samples were isolated from 49 patients. Thirty-two of these samples were classified as carbapenem-resistant using the disc diffusion method and were subjected to the PCR reaction in order to detect MBL genes. Eighteen of these 32 isolates showed the blaSPM-1 gene. Eight samples selected in different years over the study period presented the same genetic profile according to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The antimicrobial therapy was considered adequate for only 23.5% of the patients with bacteremia due to P. aeruginosa carrying the blaSPM-1 gene, and a high lethality rate of 70.6% was observed during the 30-day period after bacteremia and an inadequate initial antibiotic regimen. CONCLUSIONS: We detected the presence of a clone of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa carrying blaSPM-1 that persisted in blood culture samples over a six-year period at the institution, with high lethality, thus justifying rigorous epidemiological surveillance and a rearrangement of the antimicrobial therapy regimens at the institution.
