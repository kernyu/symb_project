The aim of this study was to identify class 1 integrons from extended-spectrum and metallo-beta-lactamase-negative, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates from Hungary and to characterize the isolates by phenotypic and molecular methods. Fourteen selected P. aeruginosa isolates resistant to ceftazidime, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin were subjected to serotyping, random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), integron content analysis, and a phenotypic test to detect high-level production of AmpC. Four representative isolates were further analyzed by multilocus sequence typing. Two P. aeruginosa multidrug-resistant clonal lineages were identified with a countrywide distribution. The first lineage is characterized by serotype O4, RAPD genotype A, sequence type ST175, and the presence of a class 1 integron harbouring aadB and aadA13 gene cassettes in its variable region. The second lineage is characterized by serotype O6, RAPD genotype B, sequence type ST395, and a class 1 integron carrying a single aadB cassette. The corresponding isolates were recovered from altogether 11 towns in Hungary. ST175 and ST395 are the presently calculated founders of two distinct P. aeruginosa clonal complexes that appear to have a wide geographical distribution also outside Hungary. The multidrug-resistant phenotype associated with these two clonal lineages might have contributed to an increase in their frequency and to their subsequent diversification. Both P. aeruginosa lineages displayed > or =8-fold synergy with boronic acid/ceftazidime combinations, suggesting an AmpC-mediated resistance to ceftazidime. Our observations underscore the role of class 1 integrons in the spread of aminoglycoside resistance by clonal dissemination among P. aeruginosa clinical isolates in Hungary.
