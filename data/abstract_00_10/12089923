Streptococcus pneumoniae has been recognized as a bacterial pathogen in human beings. It was the main cause of meningitis, almost since it was first isolated by Sternberg and Pasteur more than 100 years ago. Meningitis is constantly lethal without specifically treatment. Emergence and diffusion strains of the Streptococcus pneumoniae indicate the changes that are likely in the area of antimicrobial resistance in the last decade. Resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to antibiotics has progressed rapidly and is a global problem. This article presents the new information about Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the new possibilities of treatment of the pneumococcal meningitis.
