BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The eradication rate of proton-pump inhibitor-based triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection is low due to increasing antibiotics resistance, especially clarithromycin. Recently, it was reported in Europe that a 10-day sequential strategy produced good outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of sequential therapy as first-line treatment for eradication of H. pylori in clinical practice in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 98 patients (mean age 55.2 years and male 47, female 51) with proven H. pylori infection received 10-day sequential therapy (20 mg of rabeprazole, and 1 g of amoxicillin, twice daily for the first 5 days, followed by 20 mg of rabeprazole, 500 mg of clarithromycin, and 500 mg of metronidazole, twice daily for the remaining 5 days). Eradication was evaluated 4 weeks later, after completion of treatment by 13(C)-urea breath testing. Eradication rates were calculated by intention-to-treat (ITT) and by per protocol (PP). Compliance and adverse events were also assessed in study group. RESULTS: The eradication rate of sequential therapy was 91.8% (90/98) by ITT and same result was reported by PP analysis (89/97). The study group consisted of 66 H. pylori associated gastritis, 7 gastric ulcer, and 25 duodenal ulcer patients (67.3%, 7.1%, 25.5%, respectively). Mild adverse events happened frequently (21.4%) but the treatment was well tolerable. The most common adverse event was a bitter taste (9.2%) followed by nausea and diarrhea (4.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Ten-day sequential therapy is found to effectively eradicate H. pylori infection as first-line treatment in Korea.
