250 patients in need of retreatment for pulmonary tuberculosis were enrolled in the study. The later indicated that there was a preponderance of males constituting all-bodied age population groups aged 25 to 64 years in the age and gender structure of the examinees. The major factors contributing to reactivation of the tuberculous process and poor outcomes of a previous course of specific therapy were extensive X-ray changes in the lung, drug resistance of the pathogens of tuberculosis to first-line drugs, and neglect of X-ray findings in the determinants of the duration of treatment. The use of the standard short-term course of chemotherapy was found to result in incomplete cure of disseminated and moderately disseminated processes, particularly in drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and in concomitant diseases, which becomes a cause of early and late recurrences.
