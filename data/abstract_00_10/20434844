To determine the impact of anthelmintic resistance on the productivity of sheep grazed on pasture in a temperate climatic zone, 14 groups each of 20 lambs were grazed on pasture on which benzimidazole-resistant parasites had been detected previously, then treated every 28 days - seven groups with a benzimidazole anthelmintic (albendazole) and seven with monepantel, a member of a new anthelmintic action family which was assumed in advance to be completely effective in removing all established worms. Faecal egg counts and larval differentiation demonstrated the presence of albendazole resistance, predominantly in Teladorsagia circumcincta but also in Trichostrongylus spp. By days 84 and 112, egg counts were significantly higher in the albendazole-treated animals than in those treated with monepantel. The presence of anthelmintic resistance resulted in a reduction in live-weight of 2.8 kg, a significant increase in breech-soiling and a significant reduction in body condition score. Fourteen animals from each treatment were necropsied at a commercial abattoir and carcase weights and standard quality parameters recorded; there was a reduction in carcase weight of 2.8 kg in the albendazole-treated animals, and a difference in the carcase grades within each group. These measurements were used to calculate that the presence of anthelmintic resistance resulted in a 14% reduction in carcase value.
