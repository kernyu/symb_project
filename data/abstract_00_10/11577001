Butyrate has potent anti-tumorigenic effects on many colon cancer cell lines, including inhibition of growth and promotion of apoptosis in vitro. Nevertheless, despite the butyrate concentration in the colonic lumen being sufficient to result in the death of almost all cells in vitro, colon cancers still develop and grow in vivo, suggesting that cancer cells must develop mechanisms by which they escape the effects of butyrate observed in vitro. Insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) is an autocrine growth factor in many colon cancer cells. The aim of this study was to determine whether IGF-II influences butyrate-mediated apoptosis in LIM 2405 human colon cancer cells. Butyrate and trichostatin A, both of which are histone deacetylase inhibitors although the latter is more specific, induced apoptosis as determined by floating cell counting, Hoechst 33258 staining, DNA laddering and a cell death detection ELISA. IGF-II inhibited the effects of both agents. Butyrate but not trichostatin A also induced LIM 2405 cell migration. In contrast to the above results, IGF-II enhanced butyrate-induced cell migration. Levels of IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), which may induce apoptosis by IGF-dependent or -independent mechanisms, were increased by butyrate and trichostatin A; IGF-II augmented this effect. It is therefore unlikely that IGFBP-3 mediates butyrate-induced apoptosis. We suggest that IGF-II inhibits the pro-apoptotic effect of butyrate downstream of histone deacetylase inhibition. In contrast, IGF-II promotes histone deacetylase-dependent IGFBP-3 expression and histone deacetylase-independent migration. IGF-II may promote tumour growth by mediating the development of resistance to the pro-apoptotic effects of butyrate.
