Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains C58, A136, and BG53 are chloramphenicol resistant, and each contains the catB gene originally identified by Tennigkeit and Matzuran (Gene 99:113-116, 1991). The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in all of the strains is chloramphenicol inducible. Examination of the catB gene in strain BG53 indicates that it is regulated by an attenuation mechanism similar to translation attenuation that regulates inducible catA genes resident in gram-positive bacteria and the inducible cmlA gene that confers chloramphenicol resistance in Pseudomonas spp.
