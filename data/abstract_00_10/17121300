From November 2004 to March 2005, 50 samples (chicken, pork and beef) of registered meat and non-registered meat were purchased from supermarkets and retail markets located in Bangkok, Thailand. Each sample was evaluated for Salmonella spp by a conventional method using combination of selective enrichment media (RV+MSRV) and compared with selective enrichment medium alone (DIASALM). Our study revealed the performance of RV+MSRV for the detection of Salmonella spp was significantly better than those of DIASALM alone since the recovery of Salmonella spp in both groups of meat was high using RV+MSRV, particularly in the registered meat. In addition, the recovery of serovars in registered meat was significantly higher than those in non-registered meat. Antimicrobial resistance of 62 Salmonella isolates in both groups of meat was determined for 10 antimicrobial drugs using the disk diffusion method. The results show that 100% of isolates from both groups were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime and norfloxacin and 50-60% of isolates from both groups were resistant to tetracycline, streptomycin and ampicillin. Sixty percent of Salmonella isolates from meat showed multiresistance antimicrobial patterns.
