Telavancin, a once-daily dosing lipoglycopeptide derived from vancomycin, has a broad-spectrum microbiologic activity against gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant staphylococci. Telavancin displays a dual mode of action and a rapid bactericidal killing. The in vitro activity of telavancin is superior to vancomycin and comparable with, or greater than, linezolid, daptomycin and other novel lipoglycopeptides. Telavancin is effective against gram-positive pathogens in animal models of soft tissue infections and deep-seated infections including endocarditis, pneumonia and bacteremia. Clinical experience with telavancin in Phase II and III studies for complicated skin and skin structure infections have demonstrated similar efficacy and tolerability compared with standard anti-staphylococcal beta-lactams and vancomycin. Telavancin is in Phase III studies for nosocomial pneumonia. Telavancin seems to be promising as a novel agent for empiric therapy or as an alternative agent in serious infections caused by clinically important resistant gram-positive pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin intermediate-susceptible S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
