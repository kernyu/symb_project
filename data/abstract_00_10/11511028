Oral candidal infections are often persistent and intractable and thus the aim of this study was to develop a polymeric sustained release device to improve the topical treatment of these infections. A self curing system based on poly(ethyl methacrylate) and tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate (PEM/THFM) was used with chlorhexidine diacetate (CX) added at levels between 0 and 12% w/w. Water uptake by the device was assessed gravimetrically and CX release measured by UV spectrometry. Anti candidal activity was established by culturing azole sensitive and resistant strains of Candida albicans in the presence of the polymeric delivery device with and without CX. Candidal growth was measured by turbidimetry or surviving colony-forming unit (CFU) formation. There was an initial high release of CX over 24 h followed by a slow diffusion up to 7 days. CX inhibited candidal growth and survival markedly in vitro, with the test samples showing less than 0.5 x 10(-7) CFU/ml compared to controls (3-4 x 10(-7) CFU/ml). These results indicate the potential of a chlorhexidine containing PEM/THFM polymeric system in the treatment of persistent candidal infections.
