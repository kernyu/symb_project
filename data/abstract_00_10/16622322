The changes in cyanide-resistant respiration and metabolism of active oxygen species in drought-sensitive and drought-resistant wheat seedlings under water stress were studied. In general, drought stress decreased the level of cyanide-resistant respiration and AOX1 mRNA content in wheat seedling leaves. But the drought-resistant cultivars, which had much higher level of cyanide-resistant respiration and AOX1 mRNA content than the drought-sensitive ones, presented an ability to adapt to mild drought stress. Under drought stress, the drought-sensitive wheat seedling leaves had higher O(-.)(2) and H(2)O(2) contents, but lower SOD, POX and CAT activities than drought-resistant cultivars. We guessed that severe drought stress could break down the balance between active oxygen species and cyanide-resistant respiration. However, cyanide-resistant respiration still could participate in the drought-resistance by lowering the level of active oxygen species besides by other mechanism.
