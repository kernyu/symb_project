Folate metabolism of the malaria parasites provides two targets for current antimalarials: dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase. Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors have been used as antimalarials over the past few decades, often in combination with dihydropteroate synthase inhibitors. Resistance to these antifolate drugs developed through mutations in both target enzymes. However, limited mutation possibilities gave opportunities for the development of new drugs. Furthermore, other enzymes in the folate and related pathways are potential new targets that remain to be exploited. These include thymidylate synthase, an enzyme fused with dihydrofolate reductase in the same protein chain, serine hydroxymethyltransferase, methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, methionine synthase and enzymes in the glycine cleavage pathway.
