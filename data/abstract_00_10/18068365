Eleven flavonoid derivatives were synthesised using a modified Baker-Venkataraman rearrangement, and subsequent microwave-assisted closure of the heterocyclic ring. All of the synthetic compounds displayed antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger and Fusarium oxysporium, and two of the synthetic flavonoid analogues exhibited significant activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
