During 1999-2006, 156 isolates of Neisseria meningitidis grew from culture of blood or cerebrospinal fluid at International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Serogroup A was the most prevalent strain (97.7%); the rest were serogroup B (2.3%). Most cases of invasive meningococcal disease (88.5%) were identified in 2002-2004 and most (87.5%) occurred in children, teenagers, and young adults, which reflected a community-wide increase in meningococcal disease incidence during this period, which was not recognized previously. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone. Cotrimoxazole resistance steadily increased from 50% to 100% during 2002-2006. Resistance to azithromycin emerged in 2002 (5%), increased to 31% in 2004, but isolates in 2005-2006 were susceptible. Information from broader hospital settings and population-based data would precisely assess trends and impact to define strategies for optimal prevention and empiric therapy.
