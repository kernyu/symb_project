Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of 4 new-quinolone antibacterial reagents and 4 macrolide antibiotics against periodontopathic bacteria 21 species 24 strains of standard strains including oral related bacteria and clinical isolated (1993-1999) 20 strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis, 7 strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were determined. Minocycline HCl was used as the comparative reagent. Macrolide showed moderate antibacterial activity against standard strains of oral related bacteria except Fusobacterium nucleatum. New-quinolone showed excellent activity against Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Concerning to the clinical isolated strains, Clarithromycin effected P. gingivalis (MIC90 0.1 microgram/ml) and Levofloxacin and Ciprofloxacin showed high-potency antibacterial activity against clinical isolated Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (MIC90 0.013-0.025 microgram/ml).
