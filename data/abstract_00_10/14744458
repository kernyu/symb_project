The accuracy of the Bactec MGIT 960 system for susceptibility testing of 177 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to first line drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin) was compared with the agar reference method. The sensitivity, the ability to detect resistance, of the MGIT system was 100%, while the specificity, the ability to detect susceptibility, ranged from 98.6% to 100% for all drugs tested.
