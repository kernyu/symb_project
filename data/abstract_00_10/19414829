Transmitted antiretroviral drug resistance has been an ongoing consideration even in patients who are treatment naive. The authors retrospectively selected all eligible patients from a US-based urban HIV clinic who had a genotypic resistance assay performed prior to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Clinically significant resistance was detected in 8% of assays, and was comparable when stratified by duration of time from diagnosis to genotypic resistance assay.
