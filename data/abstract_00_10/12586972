BACKGROUND: Cefepime has activity against many hospital-acquired Gram-negative pathogens resistant to earlier beta-lactam antibiotics. This study was designed to test whether preferential use of cefepime in a pediatric intensive care unit could reduce enteric colonization with antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative rods. METHODS: After a 6-month period of uncontrolled antibiotic use, cefepime was preferentially used during 2 years as treatment for nosocomial or serious community-acquired infection. Rectal swab specimens were obtained daily on every patient regardless of antibiotic exposure during the 6 months of uncontrolled antibiotic use and during the first and last 6 months of the 2 years of cefepime preference. The study outcome was rectal colonization with a facultative Gram-negative rod resistant to at least one of four antibiotics: cefepime; ceftazidime; gentamicin; or piperacillin-tazobactam. RESULTS: The incidence of colonization by a resistant organism decreased only slightly during the first 6 months of cefepime use. By contrast, the number of antibiotic-resistant bacilli isolated from rectal swab specimens diminished from 27.6/100 patients during the baseline period to 12.9/100 patients by the last 6 months of the 2 years of cefepime preference (P < 0.01). The proportion of patients harboring at least one resistant organism decreased from 11.6% to 7.4% during the same time period (P < 0.01). A decrease in colonization with resistant organisms occurred for all the tested resistance phenotypes, including cefepime. CONCLUSION: Cefepime may possess a low potential for promoting bacillary resistance in critically ill patients, suggesting that its preferential use might be a key element in limiting the presence of antibiotic resistance in the intensive care unit.
