Two genes, epeR and epeA, are located downstream of argH in the Streptomyces clavuligerus genome. EpeR belongs to the TetR family of transcriptional regulators. It is homologous to PqrA of Streptomyces coelicolor (74.3% identity) and to NfxB of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.9% identity). EpeA encodes a protein with 14 transmembrane spanning domains (TMS) of the major facilitator superfamily. It shares 68.9% identity to PqrB of S. coelicolor and 46.5% identity to LfrA, conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Disruption of epeR results in a S. clavuligerus epeR::aph mutant which shows increased resistance to ethidium bromide and proflavine (16- and 32-fold higher than the wild type). Taking into consideration the sensitivity to drugs of different transformants carrying functional copies of either epeR or epeA, it might be concluded that both genes appear to be co-transcribed, with epeR encoding a regulatory protein which controls the expression of epeA.
