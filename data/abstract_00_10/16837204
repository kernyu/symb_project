With annual death tolls in the millions and emerging resistance to existing drugs, novel therapies are needed against malaria. Wiesner et al. recently developed a novel class of antimalarials derived from farnesyltransferase inhibitors based on a 2,5-diaminobenzophenone scaffold. The compounds displayed a wide range of activity, including submicromolar, against the multi-drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum strain Dd2. In order to investigate quantitatively the local physicochemical properties involved in the interaction between drug and biotarget, we used the 3D-QSAR methods CoMFA and CoMSIA to study some of the series, including the screened lead compound 2,5-bis-acylaminobenzophenone, 28 cinnamic acid derivatives, 29 N-(3-benzoyl-4-tolylacetylaminophenyl)-3-(5-aryl-2-furyl)acrylic acid amides, and 34 N-(4-substituted-amino-3-benzoylphenyl)-[5-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-furyl]acrylic acid amides. We found that steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobic properties of substituent groups play key roles in the bioactivity of the series of compounds, while hydrogen bonding interactions show no obvious impact. We built several highly predictive 3D-QSAR models, including a CoMSIA one composed of steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobic fields, with r(2)=0.94, q(2)=0.63, and r(pred)(2)=0.63. The results provide insight for optimization of this class of antimalarials for better activity and may prove helpful for further lead optimization.
