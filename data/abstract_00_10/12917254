OBJECTIVE: To describe the pharmacodynamic profile of daptomycin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococci species based on bacterial density in an immunocompromised mouse thigh infection model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of daptomycin was determined against two MRSA, one vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and one vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis using the immunocompromised murine thigh model. Efficacy was assessed by the change in log10 cfu in thighs after 24 h of drug treatment. RESULTS: Daptomycin produced a maximal kill of 4.5-5 log10 cfu against the MRSA and 1.5-2 log10 for the Enterococcus species. AUC/MIC was the most predictive of the PD parameters. Utilizing MICs determined in serum or broth in the calculation of the PD parameters had minimal effect on this correlation. AUCfree/MICbroth required for static effects with MRSA and Enterococcus species were 12-36 and 5-13, whereas 99% of maximal kill was achieved at ratios of 171-442 and 38-157, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal the potent in vivo bactericidal activity of daptomycin against MRSA and Enterococcus species using clinically achievable drug exposures (dose 4-6 mg/kg per day) currently under investigation in man.
