Pyrosequencing was compared to Sanger dideoxy sequencing to detect mutations in FKS1 responsible for reduced echinocandin susceptibility in Candida albicans. These methods were in complete agreement for 10 of 12 clinical isolates with elevated echinocandin MICs, supporting the potential feasibility of pyrosequencing to detect mutations within diploid fungi.
