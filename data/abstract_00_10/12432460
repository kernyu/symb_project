The ability of non-tuberculous mycobacteria to form biofilms may allow for their increased resistance to currently used biocides in medical and industrial settings. This study examines the biofilm growth of Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium marinum, using the MBEC trade mark assay system, and compares the susceptibility of planktonic and biofilm cells to commercially available biocides. With scanning electron microscopy, both M. fortuitum and M. marinum form biofilms that are morphologically distinct. Biocide susceptibility testing suggested that M. fortuitum biofilms displayed increased resistance over their planktonic state. This is contrasted with M. marinum biofilms, which were generally as or more susceptible over their planktonic state.
