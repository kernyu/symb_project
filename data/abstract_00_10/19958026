The emergence of multidrug resistant HIV-1 strains and the inability of the HAART to eradicate HIV-1 virus from infected patients demand new drugs able to interfere with an alternative step of the replicative cycle. The naphthyridone 3 (HM13N), described in the present study, is a promising anti-HIV agent due to its ability to inhibit the HIV-1 Tat-mediated transcription and the potent antiviral activity observed in acutely, chronically, and latently infected cells. The absence of any tendency to select for resistance mutations in vitro adds to the potential clinical value of this type of compounds, especially as these compounds are drug-like and obey the Lipinski rules.
