Type I (alpha/beta) interferons (IFNs) are a family of cytokines that stimulate the expression of numerous proteins that mediate an antiviral state in uninfected cells. Two Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) IFN-alpha (SasaIFN-alpha1 & 2) genes have previously been cloned and both were found to contain a putative N-linked glycosylation site. Recombinant SasaIFN-alpha1 (rSasaIFN-alpha1) produced in eukaryotic systems has repeatedly been shown to confer antiviral properties. However, different IFN-alpha subtypes may exhibit differential antiviral activities and be subject to glycosylation. To evaluate the potential therapeutic impact of a rSasaIFN-alpha, the mature form of the SasaIFN-alpha2 protein was produced in a high-level Escherichia coli expression system. Expression of the rSasaIFN-alpha2 was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, and its identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. In the homologous Chinook salmon embryonic (CHSE-214) cell line, the rSasaIFN-alpha2 incited early expression of the IFN-induced Mx protein and exhibited high antiviral activity of about 2.8 x 10(6) U mg(-1) against infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV). Conversely, antiviral protection by rSasaIFN-alpha2 was not observed in a heterologous Japanese flounder embryo (HINAE) cell line. Hence, a biologically active form of rSasaIFN-alpha2 was successfully produced using a glycosylation-deficient prokaryotic system and purified to homogeneity, suggesting that glycosylation is not required for its antiviral activity.
