(-)-Epicatechin gallate (ECg) and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) reduce oxacillin resistance in mecA-containing strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Their binding to staphylococcal cells is enhanced by the nongalloyl analogues (-)-epicatechin (EC) and (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC). EC and EGC significantly increased the capacity of ECg and EGCg to reduce levels of staphylococcal oxacillin resistance.
