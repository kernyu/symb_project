Biocide resistance has hitherto been a poorly studied subject, possibly due to the belief that such resistance was rare and clinically insignificant. Various recent findings, however, have underlined the importance of biocide resistance as a clinically relevant phenomenon. Outbreaks of biocide-resistant organisms in hospitals have been described and the genetic mechanism for resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in Staphylococcus aureus has now been elucidated. Mycobacteria resistant to commonly used endoscope disinfectants are now commonly reported and have caused numerous adverse clinical events. Cross-resistance between triclosan and antituberculous drugs has been demonstrated in other strains of mycobacteria. This is related to a common mechanism of action. The work presented here describes studies into the biocide resistance of antibiotic-resistant cocci and attempts to create biocide-resistant strains in vitro. Strains of staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA)) and enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)) had their susceptibility to biocides assayed using broth macro dilution methods and resistant strains were selected by serial subculture on biocide-containing media. Mutants were created with relative ease; for instance, triclosan minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) increased from 0.002 to 3.12 mg l(-1). Some strains of MRSA which have intermediate resistance to glycopeptides were demonstrated to have decreased susceptibility to some biocides. Biocide resistance amongst enterococci was demonstrated although there was no clear correlation between biocide and antibiotic resistance. The exact mechanisms of resistance in these strains are still being studied but it is clear that biocide resistance is an important clinical phenomenon.
