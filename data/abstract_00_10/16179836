Significant progress and new insights have been gained since Helicobacter pylori was found in 1982. Even with currently most effective treatment regimen, about 10-20% of patients will fail to obtain the eradication of H. pylori infection. This review will focus on the empirical treatment for H. pylori infection in Korea. Seven days triple therapy (proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin and clarithromycin) has been the main first line therapy for H. pylori infection in Korea after the recommendation by Korean H. pylori study group in 1998. Such triple therapy has been the effective regimen for eradication of H. pylori infection. However, the efficacy of 7 days proton pump inhibitor-amoxicillin-clarithromycin therapy becomes lower and various eradication rates probably reflects the increase in antimicrobial resistance, recently. The recent multi-center prospective randomized study and meta-analysis showed 14 days proton pump inhibitor-amoxicillin-clarithromycin therapy is more effective than 7 days or 10 days therapy. In the case of failure, quadruple therapy (proton pump inhibitor, a bismuth salt, metronidazole and tetracycline) is a very effective second-line regimen. After the failure of two or more eradication treatments, bacterial resistance to antibiotics should be evaluated and the regimen of third-line therapy should be selected according to each antimicrobial susceptibility. The empirical third-line therapies, recommended in the cases that antimicrobial susceptibility test is unavailable, are unclear of its validity at present in Korea. The triple therapies including rifabutin, moxifloxacin, or levofloxacin or dual therapy including high dose proton pump inhibitor and amoxicillin are needed to be proven as possible candidates for the empirical third-line therapy. Multiple eradication failures should be handled on a case-by-case basis by specialists.
