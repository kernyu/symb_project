Two Enterococcus strains (E. faecalis and E. faecium) isolated from 2 patients in an intensive care unit (blood and drain, respectively) were analyzed for susceptibility to 4 antibiotics (penicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, streptomycin) by agar dilution standard method (MICs), time-kill and flow cytometry. We compared the data from classical methods of antibiotic susceptibility detection, that are compulsory 24 hrs long and flow cytometry results at 5 and 24 hrs cultivation. The results from both classical and flow cytometric analyses were highly cogent and revealed the fact that flow cytometry is very useful in early diagnosis of bacterial resistance to antibiotics.
