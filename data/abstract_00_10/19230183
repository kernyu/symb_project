The authors studied drug sensitivity, mutations in the katG, in-hA, alpC, rpoB genes, virulence via the cytotoxicity test on THP-1 cells, and the viability and genetic affiliation of 53 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates versus data on the form and dynamics of a process. Sensitive and resistant strains did not significantly differ in viability and cytotoxicity. The highest death of infected macrophages was observed was seen with infection of M. tuberculosis of the Beijing B0 genotype, the least one seen with that of LAM with the similar rate of multiple drug resistance. There was a correlation of the changes in the count of lymphocytes in patients with the genetic affiliation of a causative agent. The severest course of the tuberculous process was observed in baseline lymphopenia (before treatment) in combination with multidrug resistance of mycobacteria, high and moderate cytotoxicity and high viability. Ser-Leu 531 mutation resulted in cross resistance to rifampicin and mycobutin in most cases.
