The data on 1400 patients with first diagnosed drug-resistant tuberculosis, who were followed up in 2000-2005, have been used to analyze the causes of and factors predisposing to the development of clinical, X-ray, and bacteriological features of drug-resistant tuberculosis. The prevalence of its clinical forms with a rapid progression of the process, with complications, comorbidity, the high frequency of multidrug resistance, total resistance, and massiveness and duration of bacterial isolation, which are commonly observed in socially dysadapted patients in incompliance of appropriate treatment regimens, is shown to determine a great epidemic danger. These features should be taken into account on developing and implementing the appropriate measures in both tuberculosis facilities and general hospitals.
