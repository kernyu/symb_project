The authors discuss in detail the antibiotic resistance playing role in the unsuccessful treatment of Helicobacter pylori eradication. After reviewing the frequency of the antibiotic resistant regimens in Helicobacter pylori they demonstrate the general biological forms in the development of antibiotic resistance, and the molecular-biologic background resistance against antibiotics used in the Helicobacter pylori eradication. The methods of antibiotic sensibility of Helicobacter pylori are also discussed. They summarize the therapeutic recommendations in cases of different drug resistances and underline the newer treatment possibilities.
