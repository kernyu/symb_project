One of the most effective and immediate solutions to the growing antimicrobial resistance problem is to address the role of inappropriate prescribing. Ontologies can support judicious prescribing, but use of an ontology as part of a CDSS to support antibiotic therapeutic planning has not been fully explored. The proposed research project will create and evaluate an ontology for supporting a CDSS module that generates an antibiotic-mismatch alert to guide appropriate antibiotic prescribing.
