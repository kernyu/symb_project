Seventy-eight isolates of Salmonella spp. isolated from beef sampled from the official city slaughterhouse and from retailers in Dakar, Senegal were analyzed using serotyping, antimicrobial testing and macrorestriction profiling by Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). These analyses were done to identify clonal relationships and potential transmission routes in beef channel. XbaI macrorestriction allowed defining 17 genotypes among the six main analyzed serotypes: Salmonella bredeney (3 genotypes), S. muenster (6), S. waycross (1), S. corvallis (3), S. kentucky (1) and S. brandenburg (3). The cross analysis of PFGE profiles and origin of the beef samples reveals a wide range of contamination sources in the beef channel in Dakar. Comparison of PFGE and antimicrobial resistance types shows that the Salmonella contamination sources are equally shared by the slaughterhouse (56% of the isolates) and by the distribution channel (44% of the isolates) by handlings and houseflies.
