The development and implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus has revolutionised the care of patients with this disease. Despite the positive impact that antiretroviral therapy has had on the lives of individuals with HIV infection, the adverse effects, potential long-term toxicities, complexity of regimens, development of drug resistance and cost have made decisions about when to initiate HAART difficult. The benefits and risks of antiretroviral therapy vary considerably among patients at different stages of disease, mainly as a result of the irreversible destruction of the immune system that occurs as HIV infection progresses. In acute HIV infection, the primary aim of treatment is preservation and reconstitution of HIV-specific immune function. In symptomatic or late-stage disease, the goal is control of viral replication with resulting improvement in non-HIV-specific immunity, which leads to decreased morbidity and increased survival. The most controversial decision involves when to start therapy in persons with asymptomatic chronic HIV, where the benefits are less well established and may be outweighed by the drawbacks, depending on the individual patient. In all patients, the advantages and disadvantages must be considered carefully, and the readiness and ability of the individual to adhere to a complex multidrug regimen needs to be assessed before the initiation of therapy.
