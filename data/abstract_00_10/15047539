Twelve laboratory mutants and 32 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates of Bacteroides fragilis were examined for the mechanism(s) of fluoroquinolone resistance. Five mutants had mutations in gyrA. One mutant and two clinical isolates contained a mutation in gyrB. Eight mutants and five clinical isolates accumulated significantly less ciprofloxacin than did wild-type isolates; the mutants and clinical isolates were restored to wild-type characteristics when carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone was used.
