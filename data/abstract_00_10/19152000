Perinatal transmission remains the main cause of HIV infection in the pediatric population. Treatment of HIV-infected children has become less of a problem in resource-rich countries with a remarkable decrease of perinatal infections, resulting in an effective prevention of mother-to-child transmission and antiretroviral treatment of HIV infection in pediatrics because of differences in drug pharmacokinetics, the lack of available licensed drugs, the use of different immunologic markers and age-related adherence issues. This review, for the general pediatrician, summarizes the most recent pediatric data and guidelines for treatment of HIV. Recommendations for when to initiate therapy are more aggressive in children than in adults, particularly in infants because disease progression in children is more rapid. The indications to start therapy differ by age and are based on international immunologic and clinical classification system for HIV infection. At present, combination regimens of at least three drugs are recommended. Moreover, therapies must also consider the potential complications in these children currently treated for a long time.
