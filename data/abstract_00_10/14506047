In vitro linezolid resistance was selected at a higher frequency in Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 than in recombination-deficient E. faecalis UV202. Resistance in JH2-2 was related to accumulated G2576T mutations in 23S rRNA genes, with the least resistance conferred by mutations in two of four copies. UV202 resistance was associated with a G2505A mutation present in a single copy in mutants with different MICs.
