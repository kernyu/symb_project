Cryptococcus neoformans is one of the most important causes of life-threatening fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. Lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase (CYP51) is the target of azole antifungal agents. This study describes, for the first time, the 3-dimensional model of CYP51 from Cryptococcus neoformans (CnCYP51). The model was further refined by energy minimization and molecular-dynamics simulations. The active site of CnCYP51 was well characterized by multiple-copy simultaneous-search calculations, and four functional regions important for rational drug design were identified. The mode of binding of the natural substrate and azole antifungal agents with CnCYP51 was identified by flexible molecular docking. A G484S substitution mechanism for azole resistance in CnCYP51, which might be important for the conformation of the heme environment, is suggested.
