A 38-year-old patient developed meningitis after a complicated kidney transplantation and organ rejection. Ureaplasma urealyticum was identified as the etiological agent by molecular and microbiological analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient was successfully treated with doxycycline and chloramphenicol. This is the first report of Ureaplasma urealyticum meningitis in an adult.
