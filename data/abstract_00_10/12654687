Thirty isolates of Pseudallescheria boydii were tested to compare the in vitro activity of posaconazole with those of fluconazole and itraconazole, using NCCLS methods. Posaconazole was evaluated in an immunosuppressed mouse model of disseminated pseudallescheriasis. Posaconazole was more effective than itraconazole and as effective as fluconazole in preventing death and significantly reducing the CFU of P. boydii from tissues.
