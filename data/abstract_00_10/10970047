Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a significant problem in health facilities and results in higher costs for health care and increased fatalities due to infection. The work presented here suggests that antibiotic molecular structure can be altered in a selected manner, which will revive the bacterial growth inhibiting capability. A bacterial strain PKK3535(DH1), which is resistant to the antibiotic ampicillin, was found to be highly growth inhibited by these altered forms of ampicillin when tested in tissue culture. The level of growth inhibition of bacterial strain PKK3535(DHI) was greater than 50%, for both molecular variants of ampicillin that were investigated. The bacteria strain used for testing was a clinical isolate obtained from the University Hospital of the University of Nebraska, Omaha. These two antibiotic variants were methylated ampicillin and ethylated ampicillin. The synthetic procedure for generating these variants is presented as well as the molecular structure. The methylated and ethylated ampicillin were found to be stable at 0 degrees C for many weeks, were somewhat less soluble than normal ampicillin, but dissolved in LB plate media. The resistant bacteria strain was plated onto LB media with altered ampicillin and profound inhibition of bacteria growth was seen within the first 24 hours of incubation. These molecular variants of ampicillin provide evidence of a means to combat the proliferation of resistant bacterial strains. The molecular alteration of antibiotics may provide a suitable means to study and combat the appearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
