Fifteen Bacteroides fragilis isolates from the USA, Hungary and Kuwait were examined for carbapenem resistance, for carbapenemase activity and, with the use of various PCR-based methods and nucleotide sequencing, for cfiA genes and activating insertion sequence (IS) elements. All the B. fragilis isolates were cfiA-positive, 10 of the cfiA genes being upregulated by IS elements that are already known. Of these 10, one was of a novel type (designated IS943) and two further ones (IS614B and IS614C) were suspected hybrids of IS612, IS614 and IS942. There were five cfiA-positive imipenem-resistant B. fragilis isolates with elevated imipenem MICs (minimal inhibitory concentration) that harboured no IS insertion upstream of the cfiA gene, but produced carbapenemase; these isolates might possess a novel activation mechanism. On the basis of the available phenotypic and genotypic evidence, the present data suggest that there are at least two cfiA activation mechanisms among B. fragilis isolates.
