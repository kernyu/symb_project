Solid-organ transplantation is often the last alternative in many patients with end-stage organ disease. Although advances in immunosuppressive regimens, surgical techniques, organ preservation, and overall management of transplant recipients have improved graft and patient survival, infectious complications remain problematic. Bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic infections are implicated after transplantation depending on numerous factors, such as degree of immunosuppression, type of organ transplant, host factors, and period after transplantation. Proper prophylactic and treatment strategies are imperative in the face of chronic immunosuppression, nosocomial and community pathogens, emerging drug resistance, drug-drug interactions, and medication toxicities. This review summarizes the pathophysiology, incidence, prevention, and treatment strategies of common posttransplant infections.
