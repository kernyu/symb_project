A series of ferrocenyl chalcones were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antimalarial activity against a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum. The most active compounds were 1-(3-pyridyl)-3-ferrocenyl-2-propen-1-one (6) and 1-ferrocenyl-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-propen-1-one (28) with IC(50) of 4.5 and 5.1 microM, respectively. Differences in activity were not readily explained by the size and lipophilicity characteristics of these compounds.
