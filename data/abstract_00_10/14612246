To determine if the genes for lysostaphin endopeptidase (end) and lysostaphin resistance (epr) function in streptococci, we transferred these genes from Staphylococcus simulans biovar staphylolyticus into two strains of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. The end-containing streptococci were able to produce and process proendopeptidase. Strains containing epr were more resistant to lysis by the streptococcolytic enzyme zoocin A and amino acid analysis of the peptidoglycans of the epr-containing streptococci revealed insertion of serines in their cross bridges. This is the first report of the transfer of a femABX-like immunity factor resulting in a physiologically useful effect in a different genus.
