Studies on the synthesis, structural elucidation, and biological evaluation of new conjugates of poly-S-lysine with meso-substituted porphyrins are described. The new conjugates were used in the photoinactivation of antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus strains ATCC 25923 and MRSA 110) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli strain O4). The results show that the cationic conjugates are able to photosensitize the efficient inactivation of both types of bacteria.
