The effects of a series of dihydroethano- and ethenoanthracene derivatives on chloroquine (CQ) accumulation in CQ-susceptible strain 3D7 and CQ-resistant clone W2 were assessed. The levels of CQ accumulation increased little or none in CQ-susceptible strain 3D7 and generally increased markedly in CQ-resistant strain W2. At 10 microM, 28 compounds yielded cellular accumulation ratios (CARs) greater than that observed with CQ alone in W2. At 10 microM, in strain W2, 21 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs two or more times higher than that of CQ alone, 15 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs three or more times higher than that of CQ alone, 13 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs four or more times higher than that of CQ alone, and 9 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs five or more times higher than that of CQ alone. At 1 microM, 17 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs two or more times higher than that of CQ alone, 12 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs three or more times higher than that of CQ alone, 6 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs four or more times higher than that of CQ alone, and 3 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs five or more times higher than that of CQ alone. At 1 microM, 17 of 31 compounds were more potent inducers of CQ accumulation than verapamil and 12 of 31 compounds were more potent inducers of CQ accumulation than promethazine. The nature of the basic group seems to be associated with increases in the levels of CQ accumulation. At 1 and 10 microM, 10 of 14 and 13 of 14 compounds with amino group (amines and diamines), respectively, had CARs >or=3, while at 1 and 10 microM, only 1 of the 13 derivatives with amido groups had CARs >or=3. Among 12 of the 31 compounds which were more active inducers of CQ accumulation than promethazine at 1 microM, 10 had amino groups and 1 had an amido group.
