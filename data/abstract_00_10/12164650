Oral candidiasis is perhaps the commonest infection seen in HIV disease. The aim of this workshop was to provide a sketch of the multifarious aspects of the disease from a global perspective. To this end the panellists addressed issues such as the virulence of Candida, emergence of antifungal resistance, management of candidiasis and other exotic, oral mycotic diseases. An all-pervasive theme was the dramatic differences in the management of fungal infections consequential to the availability (or the lack) of anti-HIV drugs in the developed and the developing world. Further, the social stigmata associated with the HIV disease in many developing regions in Africa and Asia appears to modify the therapeutic strategies. Additionally, the lesser-known regional variations in the disease manifestations and therapeutic approaches were stark. Further work is direly needed to address these issues.
