BACKGROUND: Conflicting results have been reported in studies evaluating the relationship between serum markers of iron overload, liver iron deposits, and HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) in chronic hepatitis C patients, and also their impact on the response to therapy in these patients. AIM: To evaluate the role of HFE mutations in the severity of liver disease and in the response to therapy in chronic hepatitis C. METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-four hepatitis C patients treated with standard interferon and ribavirin were divided into two groups according to type of antiviral response: sustained virological response (SVR) and nonresponse or relapse. We evaluated the relationship between HFE mutation and the type of antiviral response, clinical data, biochemical tests, liver histopathology, virological data, and HFE mutations. RESULTS: Of the 264 patients, 88 (32.1%) had SVR whereas 67.9% had nonresponse or relapse. Liver iron deposits were observed in 49.2% of the patients. The factors associated with SVR were hepatitis C virus genotype 2 or 3, transferrin saturation value of 45% or less, and detection of the H63D mutation. HFE mutation was more frequent in patients with iron deposits, but without association with serum iron biochemistry or severity of liver disease. Steatosis was more frequent in patients with liver iron deposits. CONCLUSION THE: H63D mutation was an independent factor associated with SVR in chronic hepatitis C patients, as also were hepatitis C virus genotype 2 or 3 and transferrin saturation value of 45% or less. Moreover, the H63D mutation was associated with liver iron deposits.
