Current knowledge on the opportunist Scedosporium apiospermum (teleomorph: Pseudallescheria boydii), generated over a period of more than 120 years, is reviewed. The natural environmental habitat of the fungus is unknown; nutrient-rich, brackish waters like river estuaria have been suggested. The fungus is strongly promoted by agricultural and particularly by industrial pollution.
