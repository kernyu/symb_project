OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular mechanism of carbapenem resistance in the clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii from Xi'an and their profile of carbapenemase production. METHODS: A total of 146 Acinetobacter baumannii strains were isolated from 6 general hospitals in Xi'an. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for all the strains, followed by detection of imipenem resistance using E-test for metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) and NaCl inhibition test for OXA type carbapenemase. Bla(OXA-23)and bla(OXA-58) were amplified by PCR, and the positive products were sequenced. RESULTS: From the collected strains, 15 non-repetitive imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains were identified, among which 14 yielded negative results in E-test for MBL production. All the resistant strains showed increased sensitivity to imipenem after NaCl inhibition, suggesting the presence of carbapenemase production. Eleven of the strains harbored OXA -23 type gene and 1 harbored OXA -58 type gene. The concordance rate of the results by NaCl inhibition test and PCR was 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Production of OXA-type carbapenemase is the most important reason for carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii in Xi'an. The OXA-58 type gene is a novel carbapenemase genotype in China. NaCl inhibition test is a convenient and cost-effective method for detecting carbapenemase in Acinetobacter baumannii.
