Silver is an effective antimicrobial agent, but older silver-containing formulations are rapidly inactivated by the wound environment, requiring frequent replenishment. These older formulations may also be pro-inflammatory and may delay healing. Acticoat (Smith & Nephew, Hull, UK) is a relatively new form of silver antimicrobial barrier dressing which helps avoid the problems of earlier agents. It has rapid and sustained bactericidal activity, and because of this may reduce inflammation and promote healing. Despite extensive testing and clinical experience, no evidence has emerged of resistance or cytotoxicity to nanocrystalline silver. This article collects together a number of presentations that were given at the 2003 European Burns Association Meeting on the use of Acticoat in the management of burns.
