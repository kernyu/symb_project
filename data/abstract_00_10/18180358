We investigated the in vitro activity of AR-709, a novel diaminopyrimidine antibiotic currently in development for treatment of community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections, against 151 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains from various European countries. AR-709 showed excellent activity against both drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant pneumococci.
