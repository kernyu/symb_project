OBJECTIVES: Mycobacterium kansasii causes a variety of infections. Although previous reports on the prognosis of antimicrobial therapy have been mostly satisfactory, problems involving treatment failure or relapse have been encountered. The purpose of this study was to establish a relationship between the clinical treatment outcomes of M. kansasii infections and bacterial drug susceptibility, and their clonality. METHODS: A total of 37 M. kansasii clinical isolates and clinical information on 34 patients were retrospectively collected in a tertiary medical centre in Taiwan. Bacterial drug susceptibility was determined by the microdilution method. The phylogenetic relationship was analysed by PFGE analysis. RESULTS: Results of PFGE typing revealed a major cluster (cluster I) and eight other divergent patterns. Two/three strains leading to treatment failure were also multidrug resistant and belonged to cluster I. CONCLUSIONS: A relationship between high drug resistance and genetic relatedness of some M. kansasii strains was established. This was associated with clinical treatment failure.
