In the wake of concerns about the level of antibiotic resistance, governments worldwide are pressing for reduced antibiotic use, hoping thereby to reverse resistance trends. Is success likely? The evidence is mixed, and expectations should be tempered by the growing realization that many resistant bacteria are biologically fit, making them difficult to displace. If resistance is unlikely to be reduced significantly by changing prescription practices, how can clinicians outpace increased resistance, particularly when much of 'big pharma' is abandoning antibiotic development?
