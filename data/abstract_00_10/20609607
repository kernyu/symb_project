Staphylococci and enterococci are common causes of urinary tract infections in cats. However, both species are rarely implicated together as causes of lower urinary tract infections associated with urethral obstruction. This report describes the first case of a multi-drug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius belonging to spa type t06 and Enterococcus faecalis urinary infection in a cat with pre-existing and recurrent urethral obstruction. Both species were isolated at >10(5)CFU/ml from a cystocentesis urine specimen. Clinical and ultrasound features, results from urinalysis, urine culture, molecular typing and susceptibility testing by minimal inhibitory concentrations determination are described. Oral treatment with nitrofurantoin, the only antimicrobial agent that constituted a viable therapeutic option, had a positive outcome.
