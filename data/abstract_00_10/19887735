The antimicrobial susceptibilities of 2,205 isolates of Escherichia coli and 1,181 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (n=610) and E. faecium (n=571) from apparently healthy cattle, pigs and broiler and layer chickens collected from 2000 to 2003 were examined using an agar dilution method. Overall, the isolates from cattle and layer chickens showed a lower incidence of resistance to almost all antimicrobials studied compared with those from pigs and broiler chickens. Fluoroquinolone resistance was found at a low level in isolates of E. coli from four animal species and in E. faecalis from pigs and broiler and layer chickens. Resistance to cephalosporin was identified in isolates of E. coli from broiler chickens in 2000-2002 and from four animal species in 2003. Incidence of antimicrobial resistance in the bacteria did not vary from year to year during the investigation period.
