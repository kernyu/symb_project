In order to search for MDR modulators, rationally designed acridone derivatives were investigated for their effect on influx or efflux of Rhodamine6G (R6G) in CAI4 cells. Results of these investigations indicate that in presence of compound 12, inhibition of growth of CAI4 cells and also an increased influx/efflux of R6G in CAI4 cells have been observed. This seems to be occurring due to the cell wall rupturing of Candida albicans. Compound 12 may be a suitable candidate for candidiasis therapy.
