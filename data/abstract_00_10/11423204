The efficacy of 18 commercial disinfectants was investigated using the type strain, isolate 24 (I. 24), of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern related Staphylococcus aureus that have shown to be associated with clinical disease in Northern Ireland broilers. Eight quartenary ammonium compound (QAC), four peroxygen, three amphoteric (AMP), one phenolic along with two chlorine-based disinfectants were tested at their manufacturer's recommended concentration (MRC) and at three 10-fold dilutions of the MRC. The efficacy of disinfectants against I. 24 was assessed in conditions with no hatchery organic matter (HOM) and in conditions with no HOM present. In addition, 17 S. aureus strains, related and non-related to I. 24 and obtained from the poultry industry were screened for any increase in resistance relative to I. 24. All disinfectants were effective against all test strains when tested in the absence of HOM. Products from the QAC and peroxygen groups were the most potent. The performance of all disinfectants was reduced in the presence of HOM. Under these conditions all chlorine-based, two out of three AMP, and one out of eight QAC disinfectants were not effective against I. 24 when tested at the MRC. The results emphasise the importance of proper application on appropriate areas, using the correct concentration and exposure time for the disinfectant.
