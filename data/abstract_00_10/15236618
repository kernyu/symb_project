BACKGROUND: Amprenavir (APV) has been shown to be effective in naive or treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients. However, the safety and efficacy of the APV 600 mg/ritonavir (RTV) 100 mg twice a day (bid) combination, the usually recommended dosage for boosted APV, have been less well studied. We assessed the predictive factors associated with virological success of APV/RTV-based regimens. METHODS: Patients in the PharmAdapt study receiving an APV/RTV-containing regimen were included in the study. The predictivity of covariates on virological response at 4 months was analysed according to the data analysis plan. We processed logistic regression using bootstrapping to allow several covariates in the models. RESULTS: Forty patients received an APV/RTV-containing regimen, 38 of whom were male (95%). Risk factors were heterosexual contacts (four patients; 10%), homosexual contacts (31 patients; 78%), and intravenous drug use (four patients; 10%). Twenty-seven per cent of patients were Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Classification System (CDC) stage A, 38% were stage B and 35% were stage C. The median baseline CD4 count was 313 cells/microL [interquartile range (IQR) 211, 414], and the median baseline viral load was 4.4 log(10) HIV-1 RNA copies/mL (IQR 3.7, 4.9). Patients were exposed to a median number of 7.5 (IQR 6, 9) drugs for a median number of 3.8 (IQR 3.3, 4.3) years. The baseline number of resistance mutations was 4 [IQR 3, 5 for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1 (IQR 0, 2)] for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and 6 [IQR 5, 8 for protease inhibitors (PIs)]. At month 4, median viral load decreased to 1.2 log(10) copies/mL (IQR 0.3, 1.6); 50% of patients had a viral load<200 copies/mL by intention-to-treat analysis. The number of APV resistance mutations was associated with viral load changes. Median APV concentration was 1750 ng/mL (IQR 1130, 2520). At month 4, using several cut-offs, neither APV concentration nor the genotypic inhibitory quotient was predictive of viral load changes. Baseline viral load and the number of protease mutations were associated with outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Efficacious APV concentrations need to be determined for antiretroviral-experienced patients. Baseline viral load and the number of mutations on the protease coding region (PRO) were associated with the virological outcome of APV/RTV-based regimens.
