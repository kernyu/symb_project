We report on a 14-day study on the efficacy of chloroquine for treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in young children of a malaria holoendemic area in rural Burkina Faso. In this community-based study, the overall treatment failure rate was 12/120 (10%), with no differences between villages. This supports the evidence for a still sufficient efficacy of chloroquine in north-western Burkina Faso.
