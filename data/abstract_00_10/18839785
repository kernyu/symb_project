An increasing prevalence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) resistance in ART-experienced and ART-naive pregnant women has been reported. Some studies suggest that antiretroviral drug-resistant viruses might have decreased replication capacity and transmissibility. However, cases of perinatal transmission of multidrug-resistant HIV type-1 (HIV-1) have been described. Here, we report the case of one child with vertically-acquired multidrug-resistant HIV-1 and the outcome of a rescue therapy with a darunavir/ritonavir- and etravirine-containing antiretroviral regimen. During the 15 months of therapy, the child showed clinical improvement, including no side effects, persistent suppression of viral replication and a great increase in CD4+ T-cell count. Paediatric HIV specialists should be prepared to manage a small, but increasing, number of babies with a 'nightmare' multidrug-resistant virus with no available treatment options. The use of experimental agents might become a compelling issue in vertically HIV-infected children born in the era of highly active ART.
