OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations and non-B subtype circulation in antiretroviral-naive chronically HIV-1-infected patients in France. METHODS: Resistance mutations were sought in samples from 530 newly diagnosed HIV-1-infected patients from October 2006 to March 2007. Protease and reverse transcriptase mutations were identified from the 2007 Stanford Resistance Surveillance list. RESULTS: Reverse transcriptase and protease resistance mutations were determined in 466 patients with duration of seropositivity <5 years. 42% of patients were infected with non-B subtype strains (CRF02 18.3%). The overall prevalence of viruses with protease or reverse transcriptase mutations was 10.6% (95% confidence interval 6.7-16.3). The prevalence of protease inhibitor, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance-associated mutations was 4.7%, 5.8% and 2.8%, respectively. Frequency of resistance was not different in patients infected with B (9.5%) and non-B (CRF02 7.8% and other 11.2%) subtypes. Baseline characteristics such as gender, age, transmission group, country of transmission, disease stage, CD4 counts and viral load were not associated with the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: In France in 2006/2007, the prevalence of transmitted drug-resistant variants was 10.6%. Prevalence of transmitted drug resistance was comparable in B and non-B subtypes. Prevalence of non-B subtypes is still rising.
