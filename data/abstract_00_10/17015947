The present study was undertaken to clarify the epileptogenic activity induced by intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v.) of antibiotics effective in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in chronically electrode implanted rats. Teicoplanin (10-100 microg, i.c.v.) caused dose-related electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure characterized by an uninterrupted high voltage and wave complex. At the same time, the rats showed forelimb clonus, head nodding, jumping and severe convulsion. At a high dose (100 microg, i.c.v.), the drug caused a severe twisting immediately after the intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v.) followed by jumping and violent convulsion with a continuous rhythmic spike and wave complex in EEG. On the other hand, vancomycin (30-1000 microg, i.c.v.) caused no or almost no epileptogenic activity in terms of behavior and in EEG. However, at a high dose (1000 microg, i.c.v.), the drug caused an occasional spike from the hippocampus without showing any behavioral changes in the rats. Fosfomycin (30-1000 microg, i.c.v.), cefazolin (10-100 microg, i.c.v.) and penicillin G (30-300 microg, i.c.v.), used as reference drugs, caused dose-dependent epileptogenic activity in both EEG. From these findings, it was found that teicoplanin caused a potent epileptogenic activity, different to vancomycin. Therefore, it can be concluded that vancomycin may be safety on epileptogenic activity used for the clinical purpose of infections caused by MRSA.
