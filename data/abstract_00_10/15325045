The anthelmintic resistance status of two field isolates derived from farms (farm A and B) located near Edinburgh were examined using both controlled efficacy tests (CET) and faecal egg count reduction tests (FECRT). Efficacies against fenbendazole (FBZ), levamisole (LEV) and ivermectin (IVM) and, for one isolate, against combinations of these anthelmintics and moxidectin were determined in naive lambs, artificially infected with the isolates and treated with the compounds at the manufacturers recommended dose rates. (FBZ, 5mg/kg bodyweight (BW); LEV, 7.5mg/kg BW; IVM, 0.2mg/kg BW; Moxidectin (MOX) 0.2mg/kg BW). In both field isolates, the predominant species found pre-treatment and the only species found post-treatment was Teladorsagia circumcincta. Resistance to FBZ, LEV and IVM was confirmed in CET and FECRT on farm A and to the latter two compounds on farm B, which had a history of benzimidazole resistance and where TBZ resistance was also demonstrated using an egg hatch assay (EHA). For the farm A isolate CET efficacies against FBZ; IVM; LEV; FBZ + IVM; FBZ + LEV; FBZ, LEV + IVM and MOX were 59, 60, 88, 94,93, 92 and 98%, respectively. The CET efficacies for the farm B isolate were 51% and 72% for LEV and IVM, respectively.
