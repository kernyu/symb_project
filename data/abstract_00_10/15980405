Seventy-four erythromycin-resistant group B Streptococcus isolates were analyzed regarding their phenotype-genotype and phenotype-serotype correlation. Four different phenotypes were assessed, one of them for the first time. ermB and ermTR were the most frequent genotypes (80%). The most prevalent serotype III showed great phenotypic variability while serotype V was strongly associated only with two different phenotypes.
