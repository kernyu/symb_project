In the course of 20 years in collaboration with dermatologists and doctors attending adolescents 75 patients were treated suffering for at least four years from 10 relapses of herpes labialis or genitalis every year. The usual treatment mitigated only temporarily their complaints but had no effect on the frequency of relapses. Two thirds of the patients had immunological examinations, in half of them shortage of IgA was found. Only 12 subjects had during comprehensive immunological examinations normal results. After 3-4 years immunomodulation with poliovaccine in rare instances combined with other immune preparations, the condition improved in 67 of 69 patients (97%), in two (3%) it remained unaltered. The procedure involved restricted exposure to tobacco smoke, alcohol, UV rays and sleep deficiency. After a comprehensive immunological examination immunomodulation with levamisol was started. This was followed by the administration of 2-3 drops of poliovaccine, at first every month, when the complaints receded the interval of vaccine administration was prolonged. When the complaints persisted the immunity of the organism was promoted by protection from influenza (vaccination, Remantadin) and other respiratory infections (Isoprinosin, Modimunal) and the general resistance was reinforced (Biostim). The mentioned procedure should be reserved for subjects with herpes persisting for a long time and with frequently relapsing herpes.
