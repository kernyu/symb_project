The antibacterial activities of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin on 100 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were determined by using standard proportion dilution method and Etest. When 98 of 100 M. tuberculosis isolates were susceptible to ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, two were resistant to both of the drugs. The correlation between E test and standard proportion dilution method was 100%.
