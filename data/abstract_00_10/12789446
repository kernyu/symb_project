Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 carrying plasmid pTOK233 encoding the hygromycin resistance (hph) and beta-glucuronidase (uidA) genes has been used to transform two agronomic grass species: tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum). Embryogenic cell suspension colonies or young embryogenic calli were co-cultured with Agrobacterium in the presence of acetosyringone. Colonies were grown under hygromycin selection with cefotaxime and surviving colonies plated on embryogenesis media. Eight Lolium (six independent lines) and two Festuca plants (independent lines) were regenerated and established in soil. All plants were hygromycin-resistant, but histochemical determination of GUS activity showed that only one Festuca plant and one Lolium plant expressed GUS. Three GUS-negative transgenic L. multiflorum and the two F. arundinacea plants were vernalised and allowed to flower. All three Lolium plants were male- and female-fertile, but the Festuca plants failed to produce seed. Progeny analysis of L. multiflorum showed a 24-68% inheritance of the hph and uidA genes in the three lines with no significant difference between paternal and maternal gene transmission. However, significant differences were noted between the paternal and maternal expression of hygromycin resistance.
