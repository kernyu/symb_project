The aim of the present study was to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) for innate and adaptive immunity in pigs. For this purpose, a Duroc x Pietrain F(2) resource population (DUPI) with 319 offspring was used to map QTL for the immune traits blood antibodies and interferon-gamma using 122 microsatellites covering all autosomes. Antibodies response to Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and tetanus toxoid vaccine and the interferon-gamma (IFNG) serum concentration were measured at three different time points and were used as phenotypes. The differences of antibodies and interferon concentration between different time points were also used for the linkage mapping. Line-cross and imprinting QTL analysis, including two-QTL, were performed using QTL Express. A total of 30 QTL (12, 6, and 12 for mycoplasma, tetanus antibody, and IFNG, respectively) were identified at the 5% chromosome-wide-level significant, of which 28 were detected by line-cross and 2 by imprinting model. In addition, two QTL were identified on chromosome 5 using the two-QTL approach where both loci were in repulsion phase. Most QTL were detected on pig chromosomes 2, 5, 11, and 18. Antibodies were increased over time and immune traits were found to be affected by sex, litter size, parity, and month of birth. The results demonstrated that antibody and IFNG concentration are influenced by multiple chromosomal areas. The flanking markers of the QTL identified for IFNG on SSC5 did incorporate the position of the porcine IFNG gene. The detected QTL will allow further research in these QTL regions for candidate genes and their utilization in selection to improve the immune response and disease resistance in pig.
