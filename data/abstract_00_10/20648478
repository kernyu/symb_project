The widespread natural sources-derived cationic peptides have been reported to reveal bacterial killing and/or growth-inhibiting properties. Correspondingly, a number of artificial peptides have been designed to understand antibacterial mechanism of the cationic peptides. These peptides are expected to be an alternative antibiotic against drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria because major antimicrobial mechanism of cationic peptides involves bacterial membrane disorder, although those availabilities have not been well evaluated. In this study, cationic peptides containing Aib were prepared to evaluate the availability as an antimicrobial agent, especially against representative pathogenic bacteria. Among them, BRBA20, consisting of five repeated Aib-Arg-Aib-Ala sequences, showed strong antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, growth of Serratia marcescens and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, known as proteases-secreting pathogenic bacteria, were also completely inhibited by BRBA20 under 20 microg/ml peptide concentrations. Our results suggested availabilities of Aib-derived amphiphilicity and protease resistance in the design of artificial antimicrobial peptides. Comparing BRBA20 with BKBA20, it was also concluded that Arg residue is the preferred cationic source than Lys for antimicrobial action of amphiphilic helices.
