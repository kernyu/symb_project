Type II IFN exists as a single molecule (IFN-gamma) in contrast to type I IFN, of which there are a number of different forms. IFN-gamma is involved both directly and indirectly in antiviral activity, stimulation of bactericidal activity, antigen presentation and activation of macrophages. Recently IFN-gamma was cloned from a salmonid fish, the rainbow trout and a functional recombinant protein produced exhibited IFN-gamma activity. This recombinant IFN-gamma was used to stimulate an Atlantic salmon cell line, SHK-1, to monitor the changes in protein expression by proteomic analysis 24 h after stimulation compared to unstimulated control cells. An SHK-1 cell proteome map was developed and proteins altered in abundance by the IFN-gamma stimulation were identified. Under the analytical conditions used, 22 proteins were found to be altered in abundance, 15 increased and 7 decreased. Several proteins were excised from the gel and identified, following trypsin digestion and MALDI-MS/MS/LC-MS and database interrogation. Transcriptional analysis of five mRNAs encoding proteins increased in abundance by IFN-gamma in the proteome analysis was determined by real-time PCR. We assessed the correlation between gene expression and change in abundance of proteins for these genes.
