The chemical space of registered oral drugs was explored for inhibitors of the human multidrug-resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2; ABCC2), using a data set of 191 structurally diverse drugs and drug-like compounds. The data set included a new reference set of 75 compounds, for studies of hepatic drug interactions with transport proteins, CYP enzymes, and compounds associated with liver toxicity. The inhibition of MRP2-mediated transport of estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide was studied in inverted membrane vesicles from Sf9 cells overexpressing human MRP2. A total of 27 previously unknown MRP2 inhibitors were identified, and the results indicate an overlapping but narrower inhibitor space for MRP2 compared with the two other major ABC efflux transporters P-gp (ABCB1) and BCRP (ABCG2). In addition, 13 compounds were shown to stimulate the transport of estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide. The experimental results were used to develop a computational model able to discriminate inhibitors from noninhibitors according to their molecular structure, resulting in a predictive power of 86% for the training set and 72% for the test set. The inhibitors were in general larger and more lipophilic and presented a higher aromaticity than the noninhibitors. The developed computational model is applicable in an early stage of the drug discovery process and is proposed as a tool for prediction of MRP2-mediated hepatic drug interactions and toxicity.
