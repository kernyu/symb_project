BACKGROUND: Acne is a multifactorial disease exhibiting distinct clinical presentations. Among them, the catamenial type is a matter of concern for young women. Some oral contraceptives may help without, however, clearing the skin condition. AIM: The present open study aimed at evaluating the effect of overnight applications of a paste made of petrolatum,15% zinc oxide and 0.25% miconazole nitrate. METHOD: The split-face trial was conducted in 35 women. A non-medicated cream was used as control. Clinical evaluations and biometrological assessments on cyanoacrylate follicular biopsies were performed monthly for 3 months. Comedometry and the density in autofluorescent follicular casts were used as analytical parameters. In addition, the five most severe cases at inclusion were tested at the completion of the study for follicular bacterial viability using dual flow cytometry. RESULTS: Compared with baseline and to the control hemi-face, the medicated paste brought significant improvement of acne. The number of papules and their redness were reduced beginning with the first treatment phase. A reduction in the follicular fluorescence was yielded beginning with the second treatment phase. The ratios between injured and dead bacteria, on the one hand, and live bacteria, on the other hand were significantly increased at completion of the study. CONCLUSION: A miconazole paste applied for 1 week at the end of the ovarian cycle has a beneficial effect on catamenial acne.
