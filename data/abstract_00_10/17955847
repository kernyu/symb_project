This article presents a case of early postoperative endophthalmitis that occurred after vitrectomy and Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (New World Medical, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA) placement and was treated with intravitreal antibiotics. Intravenous vancomycin was started after aqueous culture grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The endophthalmitis improved, but new purulent discharge around the peritomy was noted 10 days after presentation, requiring removal of the valve.
