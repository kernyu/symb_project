SETTING: Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai. OBJECTIVE: To rapidly identify multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis using a novel method. DESIGN: A new assay, based on DNA-lanthanide fluorescence, was standardised and evaluated using 93 each of coded rifampicin-resistant and rifampicin-sensitive M. tuberculosis clinical isolates for the correct identification of rifampicin resistance. The results obtained by the new assay were compared with the conventional results. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The new assay gave a sensitivity and specificity of 88% and 85%, respectively. It is simple, easy to perform and requires 48 hours for the drug susceptibility results to be available after obtaining the primary culture.
