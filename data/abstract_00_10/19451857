Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat highly resistant infections, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia occurs in pediatric patients. We present a teenager admitted for bacteremia caused by E faecalis with a distinctive pattern of resistance to linezolid. This organism has the highest MIC to linezolid reported in the literature to date.
