The recent rise in antimicrobial resistance among health-care associated pathogens is a growing public health concern. According to the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System, rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in intensive care units have nearly doubled over the last decade. Of equal importance, gram-negative agents such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and extended-spectrum beta lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae demonstrate increasing resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and, in some cases, carbapenems. As a consequence, hospitalists may find themselves utilizing new antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial infections. This case-based review will highlight 8 antibiotics that have emerging clinical indications in treating these multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens.
