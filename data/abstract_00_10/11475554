Proper identification of the organism and determination of their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents, is the most important part of the management of patients with symptoms of respiratory system infections. In the case of pulmonary infections, the utility of sputum for diagnosing the cause of lower respiratory tract infections seems to be limited. In the patients receiving antibiotics, there is a high rate of colonization of the upper respiratory tract that may lead to the overgrowth of one or an other pathogen, making it more abundant in the upper than an lower respiratory tract. Also, the patients may be unable to provide adequate lower-respiratory-tract samples. For these reason, more invasive procedures have been recommended. These include bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sampling. The purpose of our study was to determine the value of sputum and BAL fluid on the basis of profile bacteria and their drug sensitivity isolated from the patients treated in Nat. Res. Inst. Tuber. and Lung Diseases in Warsaw during period of 3 years (1995-1997). On the basis of analysis of 5926 sputum samples and 3534 bronchoscopic materials we have found that the bacterial pathogens species and drug resistant pattern were similar in sputum samples as in materials of bronchoscopic procedures. The same bacterial species and numbers Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were predominant in both type of clinical materials with near the same frequency.
