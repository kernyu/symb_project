New ketolides such as ABT-773 are a promising group of antibiotics in an era of increasing antibiotic resistance. We tested 704 invasive strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae collected from 1990 to 1998. Overall resistance was 8.3, 4.6, 4.5 and 3.6% for penicillin, cefuroxime, erythromycin and clarithromycin, respectively. By using a recommended breakpoint for susceptibility of <0.5 mg/L, no strains showed reduced susceptibility to ABT-773. ABT-773 was very active against all penicillin-resistant strains (MIC > 2 mg/L, with a mean geometric mean <0.06 mg/L), and against all 33 erythromycin-resistant strains, irrespective of the mode of resistance [mef- or erm(B)-mediated]. ABT-773 is a very active and promising agent against invasive strains of S. pneumoniae, including multiresistant strains.
