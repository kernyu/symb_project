We studied the effects of recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH) on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication by growing both wild-type and drug-resistant variants of virus in the presence of various concentrations of eight different antiretroviral drugs. r-hGH had no significant effect on either viral replication or the 50% inhibitory concentrations of these compounds.
