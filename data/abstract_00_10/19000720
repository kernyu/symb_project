The aim of the present investigation was to develop a novel approach for rapid identification and differentiation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clones from Canadian cystic fibrosis patients by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. We screened P. aeruginosa isolates for lipopolysaccharide structure and presence/absence of alginate and correlated these findings with antibiotic resistance patterns.
