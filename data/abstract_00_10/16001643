BACKGROUND/AIMS: Results of 13C urea breath test (UBT), a noninvasive test for detecting active H. pylori infection, have been regarded also numerically for a possible predictive value on bacterial load and entity of mucosal inflammation. In the present study we wished to determine whether there is a particular value of Delta Over Baseline (DOB) result which could predict resistance to anti-H. pylori therapy. METHODOLOGY: 570 subjects from 1376 tested received a standard triple anti-H. pylori regimen. After a minimum of 6 weeks subjects underwent control UBT testing. Correlation of DOB values at diagnostic and control UBT and sensitivity of different DOB levels to predict resistance to therapy were calculated using simple linear correlation and Bayes' theorem, respectively. RESULTS: Modest linear correlation was observed between DOB values (r2=0.28). The value of 13.0 at diagnostic UBT showed a sensitivity of 65.5% to predict and further positivity at control testing. CONCLUSIONS: In our large series, UBT numerical DOB value weakly predicted resistance to first-line anti-H. pylori therapy.
