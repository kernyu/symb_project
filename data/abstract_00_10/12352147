With limited data available on the optimal treatment of primary HIV infection, disease modeling can be used to project clinical outcomes and inform decision makers. The authors developed a simulation model to evaluate the clinical outcomes and life expectancy projections for three primary HIV infection treatment strategies: 1) continuous antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiated at CD4 count <350 cells/mm(3); 2) continuous ART initiated immediately on diagnosis of primary HIV infection; and 3) ART initiated on diagnosis followed by structured treatment interruption. Projected life expectancies for the three strategies were 23.92, 24.46, and 26.07 years, respectively. The impact of key variables was assessed in sensitivity analysis, with the structured treatment interruption strategy remaining the most effective over a broad range of inputs. The immunologic benefit associated with immediate therapy and the potential for antiretroviral resistance due to structured treatment interruption have the most important impact on the optimal strategy. Based on current data, immediate treatment on diagnosis of primary HIV infection followed by structured treatment interruption will likely yield the best outcome. These results can assist decision makers and those planning clinical trials in defining evidence-based performance measures for primary HIV infection treatment and future trials.
