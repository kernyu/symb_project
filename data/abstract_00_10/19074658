The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and socio-demographic risk factors for primary Helicobacter pylori antibacterial resistance. In total, 266 consecutive H. pylori strains, from untreated symptomatic adult patients who answered a questionnaire, were evaluated. Strain susceptibility to amoxicillin, metronidazole, clarithromycin and tetracycline was tested by a breakpoint susceptibility test. Metronidazole resistance was found in fewer (17.0 %) peptic ulcer patients than in non-ulcer subjects (28.3 %, P=0.037), as well as in fewer patients born in villages (12.7 %) than in those born in towns (27.6 %, P=0.016). Clarithromycin resistance varied from 8.8 to 23.4 % (P=0.009) within the hospital centres. The highest clarithromycin resistance rate was found in hospital centre A (23.4 %) compared to other centres (12.9 %, P=0.041). The factors sex, age, symptom duration, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, diabetes, type of profession and educational level were not associated with H. pylori resistance. Logistic regression revealed that the risk factors for metronidazole resistance were non-ulcer disease [odds ratio (OR) 1.95, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1.04-3.65] and a birthplace of a town (OR 2.64, 95 % CI 1.18-5.93). The hospital centre may be a risk factor (OR 2.07, 95 % CI 1.02-4.21) for clarithromycin resistance but further studies are required to verify this suggestion. In conclusion, the knowledge of the risk factors for H. pylori resistance to antibacterials could facilitate the treatment choice for H. pylori eradication.
