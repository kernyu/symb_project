The neonatal population is at extremely high risk for developing infections. Because of the premature infant's prolonged length of stay, these patients may receive several courses of antibiotics while hospitalized. Although the number of antibiotics used in this population is limited, the dosing regimens must be carefully prescribed and adjusted to account for changing pharmacokinetic parameters. In addition, the development of antimicrobial resistance should always be a concern. The neonatal nurse can help ensure antimicrobial regimens are given appropriately and monitor these regimens for efficacy and toxicity.
