One hundred Vitek-2 identified oxacillin resistant S. aureus (ORSA) isolates were tested by oxacillin screen-plate (OXA-plate) and cefoxitin disk (FOX-disk) for confirmation of oxacillin resistance. Ninety-five of 100 confirmed oxacillin resistant by both, 3 of 5 were oxacillin susceptible by both and mecA negative, and 2 of 5 were oxacillin susceptible by OXA-plate, resistant by FOX-disk and mecA positive. The FOX-disk out-performed the OXA-plate for ORSA confirmation and can be performed using standard laboratory techniques.
