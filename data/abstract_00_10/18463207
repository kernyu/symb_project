We evaluated a real-time quantitative PCR combined with a multiplex PCR assay for the quantification of Streptococcus pneumoniae and the simultaneous detection of drug-resistant genes by gel-based PCR, using purulent sputum samples. This assay correctly quantified S. pneumoniae and identified their penicillin and erythromycin susceptibilities directly from samples within 3 h.
