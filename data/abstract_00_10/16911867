The objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial resistance patterns, integron characteristics and gene cassettes as well as the presence of Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) in non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) isolates from human and animal origin. Epidemiologically unrelated Dutch NTS strains (n=237) originating from food-producing animals and human cases of salmonellosis were tested for their susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents. Resistance to 14 of these antimicrobials, including the third-generation cephalosporins, was detected. Resistance to sulphonamides, ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, trimethoprim and nalidixic acid was common (>/=10% of the strains were resistant). Resistance against three or more antimicrobials was observed in 57 isolates. The same 237 strains were studied for the prevalence of class 1 integrons, their gene cassettes and the presence of SGI1. Thirty-six isolates (15.2%) carried class 1 integrons. These integrons had ten distinct profiles based on the size of the integron and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Integrons were detected for the first time in serovars Indiana and Senftenberg. Multidrug resistance was strongly associated with the presence of class 1 integrons in which the aadA2, aadA1, bla(PSE-1), dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA14 or sat genes were present, as determined by nucleotide sequence determination. The presence of gene cassettes or combinations of gene cassettes not previously found in integrons in Salmonella was observed. SGI1 or its variants (SGI-B, -C and -F) were present in 16 isolates belonging to either serovar Typhimurium, Derby or Albany. Regardless of whether the isolate was of human or animal origin, the same resistance phenotype, integron profile and SGI1 structure could be observed.
