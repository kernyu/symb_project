Fecal samples from animal species and humans were analyzed by quantitative culture for enterococci and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). Each host species carried enterococci which exhibited intrinsic intermediate resistance to vancomycin and sensitivity to teicoplanin (Van C phenotype). The carriage rate in humans was 9%. Carriage rates varied among animal species with the highest percentages being found in deer, duck, goose, horse and turkey.
