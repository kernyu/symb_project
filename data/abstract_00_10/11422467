BACKGROUND: Clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori (CRHP) has increasingly been isolated from patients in Japan. The aim of our study was to test whether proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and their thioether derivatives, which are secreted into the gastric mucosa, could inhibit the growth and motility (a factor in colonization) of CRHP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CRHP was isolated from patients who had experienced gastritis or peptic ulcers in Tokyo and Niigata. Drugs and related agents tested were omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, the thioether derivative of rabeprazole (rabeprazole-TH), clarithromycin, amoxicillin and metronidazole. The MICs of the drugs and agents for H. pylori strains were determined by the agar dilution METHOD: Bacterial swimming in a liquid layer was examined under an inverted, phase-contrast microscope. RESULTS: The PPIs and rabeprazole-TH, but not the anti-H. pylori agents, inhibited the motility of CRHP at both pH 7.4 and 6.0. The concentrations (microg/ml) necessary to inhibit 50% of the motility at pH 7.4 were 0.25-0.5, 8-32, 8-16 and 128-256 for rabeprazole-TH, rabeprazole, lansoprazole and omeprazole, respectively. Rabeprazole-TH exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect against the growth of CRPH (MIC, 0.5 microg/ml). CONCLUSION: Rabeprazole-TH, which is secreted into the gastric mucosa, had the strongest inhibitory action against both the growth and motility of CRHP, suggesting that it is a potential novel agent for CRHP eradication.
