UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to analyse antimicrobial susceptibility of ureaplasmas isolated from the tracheal aspirates from premature infants with respiratory disorders. The study encompassed 73 ureaplasma strains, 47 belonging to U parvum (U.p.) species and 26 to U. urealyticum (U.u.). The strains were isolated paralelly on BioMerieux as well as liquid and solid PPLO media. Identification of studied strains was perfomed using PCR with primers specific to both ureaplasma species. Susceptibility to doxycycline (DOX), tetracyclin (TET), josamycin (JOS), azithromycin (AZY), erythromycin (ERY), clarytromycin (CLA), ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), pristinamycin (PRI) was tested using a BioMerieux Mycoplasma IST 2 kit. RESULTS: in 7 of 9 examined antimicrobials the percentage of susceptible U.u. was lower thain the percentage of U.p. susceptible strains. CONCLUSIONS: The biggest differences related to susceptibility reffered to macrolides. Higher resistance of U.u. species to antimicrobials may suggest its higher pathogenecity.
