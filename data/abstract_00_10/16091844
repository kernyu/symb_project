We describe a general strategy for the identification of functional genes that, when downregulated, result in a selectable phenotype. This strategy is based on expression selection of cDNA fragments that counteract their cognate genes. A cDNA library containing random fragments expressed in human HepG2, A375 and CLS-354 cells was used to identify functional genes whose inhibition conferred resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis. Thirty-five clones were isolated, 28 of which were derived from unknown genes, that tagged 19 individual genes and 7 of which referred to known genes that tagged the apoptosis-related protein (APR)-1, -2 and indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3,-dioxygenase (IDO). The ability of APR-1-, -2- and IDO-derived antisense RNAs to induce resistance to Fas in HepG2, A375 and CLS-354 cells suggested that APR-1, -2 and IDO genes are involved in the machinery of Fas-mediated apoptosis. Our gene discovery strategy provides a generally applicable procedure to identify functional genes that interfere with apoptosis, and may therefore be clinically relevant for tumor therapy.
