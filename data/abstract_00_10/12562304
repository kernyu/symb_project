Cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139, is characterised by profuse purging of watery stools, and vomiting and dehydration. The mainstay of therapy of cholera patients is rehydration with oral rehydration salt solution or intravenous Ringer's lactate depending upon the degree of dehydration. Antibiotics such as tetracycline, doxycycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and furazolidone may be used as an adjunct to rehydration therapy for severely purging cholera patients to reduce the rate of stool output. This shortens the duration of hospital stay, stops excretion of vibrios in the stool and minimises the requirement of fluids. Resistance to many of these drugs has been observed and is a matter of concern. Other antidiarrhoeals are not recommended. Many antisecretory drugs have been tried as an adjunct therapy, unfortunately, until today, none has been found useful in the treatment of cholera. Feeding during and after cholera is emphasised.
