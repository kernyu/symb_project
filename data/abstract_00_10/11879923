Acute rhinosinusitis represents a condition for which educational efforts could help minimize the inappropriate use of antibiotics, particularly for children. The majority of acute rhinosinusitis cases are of viral etiology and thus, are self limiting. Although bacterial infection complicates a small number of cases, the lack of accessibility to the sinus, the limitations of diagnostic modalities and the lack of specificity among signs and symptoms often make it difficult to determine when bacterial infection occurs. Furthermore, antimicrobial resistance among the pathogens that frequently cause bacterial infection complicates the election of empiric therapy. The Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership recently developed and published antimicrobial guidelines to provide practitioners in the US with recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. The purpose of this paper is to review the rationale behind the development of these guidelines and how they apply to the management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in children.
