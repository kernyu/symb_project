BACKGROUND: This study was designed to investigate the impact on mortality of colonization by glycopeptide-resistant Enterococci (GRE) during hospitalization. METHODS: Between 2004 and 2006, a hospital in Nancy, France, was subject to a GRE van A outbreak. Some 113 patients who had acquired GRE after hospital admission were matched with 113 controls. Basic demographic data, such as sex, age, principal pathology, history of surgery, and presence of associated pathology, were obtained for each case and control. Information on whether or not the case subject was still alive was obtained by searching the hospital mortality database and the civil death register and by phoning the patient's home. Statistical analysis used the Cox proportional hazards model for calculating survival function with SPSS software version 9.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). RESULTS: The mean age was 71.2 in the GRE+ group and 70.8 in the control group (P = .80). There was a significant difference between the groups for severity status health (P = .035). The mortality rate was 30.1% in the case group and 19.5% in the control group. Single predictor variable analysis showed a hazard ratio of death in the case group of 4.61 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.58-8.28], P = 2 x 10(-7)). The final Cox regression model with multiple predictor variables showed that only GRE presence (OR, 1.63 [95% CI: 1.04-2.57], P = .035) and severity of comorbidity (P = .013) were independently significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the GRE acquisition has a poor prognosis and that this is independent of the other prognostic factors such as age and severity of underlying disease. Survival in GRE+ patients was significantly shorter.
