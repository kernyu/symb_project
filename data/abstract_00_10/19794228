There are now 26 antiretroviral drugs and 6 fixed-dose combinations, including reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, integrase inhibitors and fusion (or entry) inhibitors, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use. Although they are clinically effective when used in combination, none of the existing drugs are considered ideal because of toxic side effects and the ascendance of inducing drug-resistant mutants. Development of new antiviral agents is essential. In the past decades, there has been great progress in understanding the structure of HIV type-1 (HIV-1) gp41 and the mechanism of HIV-1 entry into host cells. This opened up a promising avenue for rationally designed agents to interfere with this process. A number of fusion inhibitors have been developed to block HIV-1 replication. Enfuvirtide (T20) was one of those approved for clinical use. This signalled a new era in AIDS therapeutics. It is a synthetic polypeptide with potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 infection. However, it is sensitive to proteolytic digestion and resistant virus strains are easily induced with multiple clinical use. One of the directions in designing new fusion inhibitors is to overcome these shortages. In the past years, large numbers of promising fusion inhibitory peptides have emerged. The antiviral activities are more potent or they can act differently from that of T20. Some of these new compounds have great potential to be further developed as therapeutic agents. This article reviewed some recent developments of these peptides and the possible role in anti-HIV-1 therapy.
