Infection is an important consideration in war wounds. Improvements in survival and use of increasingly broad-spectrum antibiotics have led to new challenges with novel pathogens and conventional pathogens with multiple drug resistance patterns.. learnt in conflicts centuries ago. The cornerstone remains early, appropriate and repeated surgery. Antimicrobial agents contribute a very minor part to overall patient outcome, but prudent use of antibiotics and good infection control is essential to prevent establishment and spread of hospital-acquired infections. Research in progress will provide an evidence base for antibiotic and infection control policies and baseline data for research into novel wound management strategies.
