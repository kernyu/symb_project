Intestinal tract colonization with vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) was studied during five months and 25 days. Out of 171 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, 124 (73%) were included in this study. Thirty five of them (28%) were recognized as colonized with VRE. VRE isolates (n = 35) were identified as Enterococcus faecium (n = 18), Enterococcus gallinarum (n = 16), and Enterococcus raffinosus (n = 1). All of them were resistant to vancomycin (MIC90 = 512 microg/ml) and to teicoplanin (MIC90 = 32 microg/ml), having the vanA gene. By means of molecular methods a high homology was found among E. faecium and E. gallinarum isolates, respectively, suggesting their spread as a kind of outbreak. No significant differences in age or sex were found among colonized and non-colonized patients (p > 0.05). On the other hand, the hospitalization time and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics were associated with colonization. From this study we highlight the importance of enhancing all measures of control and prevention of hospital infections, carefully analyzing the empiric antimicrobial schemes, trying to reduce the hospital stage, and following the surveillance to evaluate the efficacy of such procedures.
