Praziquantel is efficacious against the adult stages of all human schistosome parasites, and has become the drug of choice for morbidity control of schistosomiasis. There is concern that resistance to praziquantel might develop or already exists, and could be further facilitated through new control initiatives relying on large-scale administration of praziquantel. Therefore, monitoring praziquantel efficacy in different epidemiological settings is required. We assessed the efficacy and side effects of praziquantel against Schistosoma mansoni in a rural community of western Cote d'Ivoire. Three consecutive stool specimens from 545 children and adults were examined by the Kato-Katz technique, revealing an overall prevalence of 40.9%. S. mansoni-infected individuals were treated with a single oral dose of praziquantel at 40 mg/kg. The most frequent side effects were abdominal pain, dizziness and diarrhoea. The overall cure rate, assessed 6 weeks post-treatment, was 60.9%. Moderate or heavy infections were only cleared in half or one-third of the individuals, respectively. The total egg count reduction was 61.4%. Infection intensity pre-treatment was significantly associated with age, cure rate, reported diarrhoea and dizziness. Our findings call for additional studies that rigorously evaluate the efficacy of praziquantel against different schistosome species in entire communities, using similarly sensitive diagnostic approaches as employed here.
