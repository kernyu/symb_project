This article reviews the recent studies on H2O2 adaptation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When the cell exposed in the H2O2 sub-lethal doses, the plasma membrane permeability decreased, meanwhile the plasma membrane fluidity is minished. These changes resulted in a gradient across the plasma membrane, which conferring a higher resistance to oxidative stress. Recent work has also shown that the yeast cells adapted to H2O2 would lead to several changes in the expression of genes coding the key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lipid profile and in the organization of lipid microdomains of the plasma membrane, which finally decreased its' permeability and fluidity. The reorganization of the plasma membrane might be the major mechanism of the H2O2 adaptation. Once the yeast cells adapted to the external H2O2, changes in plasma occurred. The H2O2 dependent signaling pathways in the plasma membrane might be activated by high levels of H2O2. But the details of the signaling events should still be further studies.
