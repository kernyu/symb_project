The macrolide and lincosamide (ML) resistance phenotype of 65 pigeon and 30 human Streptococcus gallolyticus strains was determined by the disk diffusion method. Constitutive resistance against the tested antibiotics was seen in 13 human and 28 pigeon strains. Simultaneous screening for the presence of erm(B) and mef(A) genes using PCR revealed that the erm(B) gene was present in 40 out of these 41 phenotypically resistant S. gallolyticus strains while the mef(A) gene was detected in only one resistant and one susceptible human-derived strain. The erm(B) genes of 10 human and 10 pigeon S. gallolyticus strains were sequenced and compared. Four human and seven pigeon strains possessed exactly the same sequence for the erm(B) gene. The sequence of the erm(B) gene of the remaining strains differed in one to five nucleotides. These findings could indicate a possible exchange of resistance genes between human and pigeon strains.
