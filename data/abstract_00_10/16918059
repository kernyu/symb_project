Zygomycosis is a highly aggressive infection observed in immunocompromised patients, such as those with haematological malignancies. The sites most frequently involved are the sinuses and the lungs. New diagnostic tools and new antifungal treatments are essential in order to diagnose early and treat efficiently infections due to moulds. We report a case of sinusitis due to Absidia corymbifera occurring during chemotherapy-induced bone marrow aplasia in a patient with acute leukaemia. The sinusitis was successfully treated with AmBisome, and surgical debridement.
