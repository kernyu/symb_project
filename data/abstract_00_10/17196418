Coumarin and its derivatives are naturally occurring substances with multiple biological activities. Here we demonstrate that prophylactic peroral administration of coumarin or 7-hydroxycoumarin (7-OHC) enhances resistance to subsequent lethal Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium infection in mice. 7-OHC decreased bacterial load in liver and spleen, and enhanced phagocytosis and bacterial killing by macrophages when applied in vitro and in vivo. 7-OHC treatment induced significant NO release in peritoneal macrophage cultures. The observed protective effect correlated with the induction of Th1-associated cytokines, such as IL-12, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha. These data demonstrate a clear immunomodulatory potential of coumarins which might have important therapeutic implications to enhance resistance to infection.
