The Etest MBL (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) correctly differentiated all 57 isolates of Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the bla(IMP-1) allele and 135 of 137 (98.5%) Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. isolates with the bla(VIM-2) allele. The Etest MBL was reliable for detecting the IMP-1- and VIM-2-producing Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter isolates.
