Co (II), Cu (II) and Ni (II) complexes of starch dialdehyde dithiosemicarbazone (DASTSC) of low (approximately 15%) degree of oxidation were prepared and their tuberculostatic activity was tested in vitro against isoniazid-sensitive and isoniazid-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In 10-week lasting tests the DASTSC complex with Ni (II) was tuberculostatic to a similar extent as was the free ligand, whereas the Co (II) and Cu (II) complexes inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis more efficiently. It was also proved that the corresponding non-co-ordinated metal salts were inactive to both strains of M. tuberculosis.
