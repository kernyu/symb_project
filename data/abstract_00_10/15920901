The in vitro activity of fluoroquinolones, including lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin, was evaluated against 55 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by absolute concentration method on Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) and Middlebrook's 7H11 media. Both ofloxacin susceptible and ofloxacin resistant strains of M. tuberculosis isolates were tested. The in vitro activities of these fluoroquinolones on the M. tuberculosis isolates were in the order: lomefloxacin < ciprofloxacin < or = ofloxacin < sparfloxacin < moxifloxacin = gatifloxacin. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin showed low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for both ofloxacin resistant and ofloxacin susceptible strains even though some cross resistances were observed.
