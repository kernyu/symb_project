The avermectin analogue doramectin (CHC-B1), which is produced in mutants that have an altered biosynthesis pathway of avermectin, is one of the most effective agricultural pesticides and antiparasitics. We report here the construction of a bkdF olmA double-deletion mutant lacking one of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase encoding genes (bkdF) and the oligomycin PKS encoding gene cluster (olmA) in Streptomyces avermitilis 76-05. We then characterized the production of various antibiotics in cultures of the deletion mutant. In a fermentation medium supplemented with cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, this double mutant produced doramectin and its analogues but no oligomycin. The mutant proved to be genetically stable, without any antibiotic resistance markers inserted into its chromosome, and could potentially become an industrial doramectin-producing strain after further improvement.
