Acinetobacter species are problematic nosocomial pathogens. In November 1997, pathogens isolated by microbiology laboratories were collected from 15 hospitals in Brooklyn, New York. Acinetobacter species accounted for 10% of gram-negative isolates. Only half of Acinetobacter species were susceptible to carbapenems; 11 hospitals had at least 1 isolate resistant to carbapenems. Other Acinetobacter susceptibility rates were as follows: polymyxin, 99%; amikacin, 87%; ampicillin/sulbactam, 47%; ceftazidime, 25%; and ciprofloxacin 23%. Overall, 10% were resistant to all commonly used antibiotics. Genetic analysis by use of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of 12 carbapenem-resistant isolates revealed 4 strains that were recovered from >1 hospital, which suggests interinstitutional spread. Antibiotic usage data from 11 hospitals revealed that the use of third-generation cephalosporins was associated significantly with the percentage of carbapenem-resistant strains (P=.03). Resistant Acinetobacter species have become endemic in Brooklyn, New York. Citywide strategies that involve surveillance, infection-control practices, and the reduction of antibiotic usage may be necessary to control the spread of these pathogens.
