OBJECTIVE: Mutations in topoisomerase genes were main cause of the resistence of Salmonella typhimurium to fluoroquinolone. METHODS: The MICs of three Salmonella typhimurium isolates X2, X7, X11 to ciprofloxacin were above 32 microg/ml, 0.38 microg/ml and 0.023 microg/ml, respectively. The genetic alterations in four topoisomerase genes, gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE were detected by multiplex PCR amplimer conformation analysis in these three strains. RESULTS: X2 isolate showed both gyrA mutations (Ser83-->Phe, Asp87-->Asn) and parC mutation (Ser80-->Arg). X7 isolate showed a single gyrA mutation (Ser83-->Phe) and X11 isolate had no changes in all of the four quinolone resistance genes, gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE. X7 isolate with a single gyrA mutation was less resistant to ciprofloxacin than X2 with double gyrA mutations and an additional parC mutation. CONCLUSION: GyrA and parC genes play important role of the resistance of Salmonella typhimurium to ciprofloxacin.
