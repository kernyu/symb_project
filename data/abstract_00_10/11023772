Chronic active hepatitis B exacerbations have been reported following development of resistance to or withdrawal of lamivudine in HIV-infected patients. A 38-year-old woman with HIV and chronic HBV infections was hospitalized because of acute hepatitis. The occurrence of cytolysis with replication of HBV 2 months after withdrawing lamivudine suggests that our patient experienced a severe reactivation of HBV infection due to the modification of her treatment. Sequencing of the HBV precore region showed the strain to be a mutant. We conclude that lamivudine should not be stopped in HIV- and HBV-infected patients, but could be continued at the dose of 100mg/day as used in isolated HBV infection.
