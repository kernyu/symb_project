The recently identified murMN operon is essential for the production of branched-structured muropeptides in the cell wall and also for the expression of the resistant phenotype in penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The purpose of studies described in this communication was to understand better the role of murMN in penicillin resistance. Deletion of murM in the penicillin-resistant strain Pen6, which causes reduction in the penicillin MIC from 6.0 to 0.03 microg/ml, was successfully complemented to recover the original high level of penicillin resistance in transformants that received functional murM alleles cloned in plasmid pLS578. Inactivation of penicillin resistance was not accompanied by any detectable change in the low affinity or abnormal molecular size pattern of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) nor in the mosaic sequence of PBP2X typical of resistant strain Pen6. Exposure of strain Pen6 with inactivated murM to 0.05 microg/ml of penicillin (i.e., a concentration more than 100 times below the MIC of the parental strain) initiated a phenotypic response typical of penicillin-susceptible strains of pneumococci: inhibition of growth followed by rapid and extensive loss of viability and lysis. Unexpectedly, inactivation of murMN also caused hypersensitivity to lysis by low concentrations of a variety of cell wall active antibiotics such as fosfomycin, D-cycloserine, and nisin, suggesting that the murMN operon may perform an important regulatory role in the control of the irreversible antimicrobial effects of cell wall inhibitors.
