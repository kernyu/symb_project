A "Tet(L)-12" version of Tet(L), a tetracycline efflux protein with 14 transmembrane segments (TMS), was constructed by deletion of two central TMS. Tet(L)-12 catalyzed Na+/H+ antiport and antiport with K+ as a coupling ion as well as or better than wild-type Tet(L) but exhibited no tetracycline-Me2+/H+ antiport in Escherichia coli vesicles.
