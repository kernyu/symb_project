Transposon-induced B. pseudomallei mutants deficient in membrane proteins production were obtained for evaluation of the functional role of these cell components. In comparison with the wild type strain B. pseudomallei 57576, mutant clones TTM6, TTM7 and TTM9 carrying Tn5 chromosome insertions were characterized by lost or decreased production of outer membrane proteins 27, 48, 52, 150, 200 kDa. Alterations in outer membrane protein spectra were accompanied by twofold increase in susceptibility of bacteria to fluoroquinolones (pefloxacin, ofloxacin) and cephalosporins (ceftazidime) and noticeable reduction of virulence for white mice and guinea pigs in contrast to the initial strain, the obtained mutants were also less resistant in in vitro phagocyte killing.
