Recent data indicate that fosamprenavir/ritonavir as part of an initial antiretroviral regimen in HIV-1-infected patients is associated with favourable efficacy and tolerability and in the KLEAN study (kaletra versus lexiva with epivir and abacavir in antiretroviral-naive patients) it was found to be non-inferior to lopinavir/ritonavir in association with abacavir/lamivudine. In our open-label, observational study conducted in 82 therapy-nasmall yi, Ukrainianve HIV-1-infected patients followed-up for 18 months, virological and immunological efficacy was comparable in subjects receiving a fosamprenavir/ritonavir-based and a lopinavir/ritonavir-based treatment (proportions of patients with HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at month 18 were 76.9% and 74.4%, respectively, when discontinuations were counted as failures). At the same time, frequency of treatment discontinuations and adverse events were similar in both groups, whereas incidence of diarrhoea and hypertriglyceridaemia was significantly higher in lopinavir-treated patients than in fosamprenavir-treated ones (53.5% vs. 25.6% and 69.8% vs. 43.6%, respectively; P < 0.01). In subjects with virological failure, no viral protease resistance mutations were detected by genotype analysis.
