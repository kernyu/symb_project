Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus comprise relatively benign local skin infections, as well as serious generalised conditions. In Denmark, more than 85% of all S. aureus isolates are found resistant to penicillin, whereas resistance to methicillin is rare (< 1%) and therefore one of the penicillinase-stable penicillins is still the drug of choice. Dicloxacillin is usually chosen, because of its superior penicillinase stability. Infections caused by methicillin resistant strains may be treated with different combinations of macrolides, fusidic acid, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and rifampicin, but vancomycin is generally used. Newer drugs like the oxazolidinones and streptogramins are effective against methicillin-resistant strains and will be available in Denmark within a short time. Antibiotic treatment, however, is most often only a supplement to surgical intervention. This paper deals with the clinical picture and treatment of some common S. aureus infections.
