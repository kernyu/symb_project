The choice of the antibiotic should be based on clinical, chest X-ray radiography and essentially microbiologic criteria. Incurrent practice treatment is more often empiric based on epidemiologic characteristics of the microbiologic agents and the particularities of each patient. A satisfactory approach requires, in addition, a perfect knowledge of different available antibiotics and the resistance of certain etiologic pathogens to these latters. because S. Pneumoniae is the most frequently encountered pathogen, B lactams and especially Penicillin G. and amoxicillin remain the most useful drugs prescribed for adults with risk factors. However, in advanced age patients and those with comorbidity, the spectrum should be enlarged and should include, besides S. Pneumoniae, H. influenzae and other Gram negative bacilli. When the pneumonia is more severe and has required hospitalization, the antimicrobial therapy must be immediate, multiple and large. The causal agent must be searched for desperately, so that the antimicrobial therapy can be adapted secondary to the results of the antibiogram.
