The presence of p53 mutation or deletion predicts for poor response to conventional therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We sought to determine whether the humanized anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab was effective in this patient group. Thirty-six patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL were treated with alemtuzumab, 15 (42%) of whom had p53 mutations or deletions. Clinical responses in patients with p53 mutations, deletions, or both were noted in 6 (40%) of 15 versus 4 (19%) of 21 of patients without. The median response duration for this subset of patients was 8 months (range, 3-17 months). These data suggest that alemtuzumab may be an effective therapy for patients with CLL with p53 mutations or deletions.
