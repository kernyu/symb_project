Daptomycin, a new lipopeptide antibiotic, is highly bactericidal against the majority of Gram-positive human pathogens, including methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Its mechanism of action is unique resulting in the destruction of the membrane potential without lysing the cell wall. The mechanism of action of daptomycin, its antibacterial spectrum, the development of resistance and pre- and clinical studies are discussed in this review.
