OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of topical cyclosporin A 0.05% in the treatment of patients with severe, steroid-resistant atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC). DESIGN: Multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized trial. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two patients with AKC refractory to topical steroid treatment. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with topical 0.05% cyclosporin A eyedrops or a placebo (artificial tears) for a period of 28 days, 6 times daily during the first 2 weeks and 4 times daily during the last 2 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms (itching, tearing, discomfort, mucous discharge, and photophobia) and signs (bulbar conjunctival hyperemia, upper tarsal conjunctival papillae, punctate keratitis, corneal neovascularization, cicatrizing conjunctivitis, and blepharitis) of AKC recorded on the day of enrollment and at the end of the treatment period. RESULTS: A composite score computed by summing the severity grade over all 5 symptoms and 6 signs of AKC for each patient indicated a greater improvement in the cyclosporin A group relative to the placebo at the end of the 4-week treatment period (P = 0.048 and P = 0.002, for symptoms and signs, respectively). No adverse effects of the treatment with cyclosporin A 0.05% eyedrops were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Topical cyclosporin A 0.05% seems to be safe and have some effect in alleviating signs and symptoms of severe AKC refractory to topical steroid treatment.
