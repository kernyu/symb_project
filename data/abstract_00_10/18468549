Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide problem. For patients with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia, resistant pathogens pose a significant challenge to successful treatment outcomes and to the cost-effective delivery of health care. In the developing world, antibiotic resistance may be relatively more prevalent compared with Western countries. Common resistant pathogens include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multidrug resistant Acinetobacter species, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The emergence of these strains has provided a major impetus toward development of the present consensus treatment recommendations of the Asian HAP Working Group. The following review provides summary data regarding the incidence and prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in 10 Asian countries.
