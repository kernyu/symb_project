INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to utilize an in vitro biofilm model of subgingival plaque to investigate resistances in subgingival biofilm communities to antibiotics commonly used as adjuncts to periodontal therapy. METHODS: Biofilms were grown on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite supports in trypticase-soy broth for 4 h-10 days and then exposed for 48 h to either increasing twofold concentrations of tetracycline, amoxicillin, clindamycin, and erythromycin or therapeutically achievable concentrations of tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and amoxicillin/metronidazole. RESULTS: Concentrations necessary to inhibit bacterial strains in steady-state biofilms were up to 250 times greater than the concentrations needed to inhibit the same strains grown planktonically. In the presence of therapeutically available antibiotic concentrations, significantly higher proportions of the biofilms remained viable as the biofilms reached steady-state growth. The combinations of amoxicillin/clavulanate and amoxicillin/metronidazole were the most effective in suppressing growth. These combinations were particularly effective against biofilms up to and including 7 days of age and inhibited 90% or more of the bacteria present relative to untreated controls. As the biofilms approached steady state, these combinations were less effective with 50-60% of the bacteria retaining viability. CONCLUSION: Most, but not all, species of subgingival bacteria are considerably more resistant in biofilms than in planktonic cultures. Resistance appeared to be age-related because biofilms demonstrated progressive antibiotic resistance as they matured with maximum resistance coinciding with the steady-state phase of biofilm growth.
