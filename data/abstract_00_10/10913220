We report a series of 4 cases of community acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus hand infections in patients without risk factors. Methicillin-resistant S aureus infections commonly involve the skin and soft tissue; therefore, hand infections may become more common as the prevalence of this pathogen increases. Hand surgeons must be aware of this emerging pathogen and obtain appropriate tissue cultures to diagnose and effectively treat this infection.
