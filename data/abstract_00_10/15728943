Nitroimidazole resistance (nim) genes were detected in 2% of 1,502 clinical Bacteroides fragilis group strains isolated from 19 European countries, and a novel nim gene was identified. High metronidazole resistance could be induced in nim-positive strains, which emphasizes the importance of acknowledging metronidazole resistance in the clinical setting.
