For older adults in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), the rate of infections caused by antimicrobial resistant strains of bacteria has increased and is prompting renewed interest in investing health care resources for prevention and control of these pathogens. This document offers a simple framework to combat infections due to antimicrobial resistant bacteria in LTCF residents by providing a multi-step approach consisting of four major strategies: prevent infection, diagnose and treat infection effectively, use antimicrobials wisely, and prevent transmission. Recommendations from this multi-step approach are directed at LTCF medical directors and practicing clinicians involved with the medical care of older adult LTCF residents.
