Isogenic strains containing insertional disruptions of 10 Haemophilus influenzae Rd genes were investigated for their effects on the susceptibility of the organism to various classes of antimicrobial compounds. MIC results show that HI1462, which encodes an Escherichia coli TolC homolog, is the third component of the H. influenzae AcrAB pump.
