BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Information regarding serotype distributions of Streptococcus pneumoniae causing ophthalmic infections is scanty. This study was therefore undertaken to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility status and serotypes of S. pneumoniae isolated from various ophthalmic infections and to compare with those isolated from systemic infections and commensal nasopharyngeal flora. METHODS: Thirty eight of S. pneumoniae isolates from ophthalmic infections, 9 from systemic infections and 14 from the nasopharynx of apparently healthy school children were biochemically characterized and tested for in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility to various antibiotics. Serotyping of these 61 isolates was done by a rapid co-agglutination method. RESULTS: All the 61 isolates were sensitive to oxacillin (penicillin) and susceptibility against other antimicrobials was variable. No multidrug resistance was observed. The 38 ophthalmic isolates were distributed in 15 different serotypes. Most prevalent serotypes were 14, followed by 8 and 19F. The 9 systemic and 14 commensal. isolates of S. pneumoniae were distributed in 7 and 11 serotypes respectively. Three of the systemic and six of the commensal serotypes were observed in ophthalmic infections whereas four of the commensal serotypes were observed in systemic infections. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: Resistance to penicillin was not observed. In ophthalmic infections, a wide range of serotypes of S. pneumoniae were observed. More than half of the commensal serotypes obtained in the study as well as majority of the systemic serotypes were observed in ophthalmic infections.
