Fluoroquinolones resistance in bacteria can be due to chromosomal and plasmid-mediated mechanisms. Of growing concern is the acquisition of genes encoding quinolone resistance in combination with other resistance mechanisms such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. In this study we describe the identification of an isolate of Escherichia coli from cattle which carried qnrS1 in combination with a blaCTX-M gene, although they were not co-localised on the same plasmid. In addition, using a DNA array it was possible to identify several other antimicrobial resistance genes in this isolate. This is the first report of a qnr gene in E. coli from cattle in the UK and highlights the need for surveillance of these emerging resistance mechanisms.
