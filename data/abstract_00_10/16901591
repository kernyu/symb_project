There are few data published regarding the incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia in Italian children. A 14-month surveillance study was conducted in 10 paediatric hospitals to investigate the rate of Sp bacteremia in children aged less than 5 years. The serotype prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates were determined. A total of 55 Sp isolates were obtained from 4576 blood cultures (incidence rate, 1.2%). In order of frequency, the most common serotypes were 14, 23F, 19F, 9V, 1. Serotypes in the 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F) accounted for 70% of isolates under 2 years of age, and 58% in the interval between 2 and 5 years of age.
