IDX899 is a novel nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) with potent in vitro activity against wild-type and NNRTI-resistant strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and with a high genetic barrier to resistance. Single rising doses of 50 and 100 (given by use of a 50-mg capsule) and 200, 400, 800, and 1,200 mg (given by use of a 200-mg capsule) of IDX899 or matching placebo were administered sequentially to cohorts of healthy male subjects, followed by the administration of multiple doses of 800 mg once daily (QD) or 400 mg twice daily (BID) for 7 days. A single dose of 400 mg was also administered to a cohort of females. IDX899 was administered orally under fasted (50- to 400-mg doses) and then fed (> or = 200-mg doses) conditions. Exposure to IDX899 was dose proportional and comparable in males and females. With a different drug-to-excipient ratio, the 50-mg capsule led to a higher exposure but a shorter mean terminal half-life (t(1/2)) of 6.2 to 6.8 h. The 200-mg capsule resulted in a more sustained exposure with a longer mean t(1/2) of 7.9 to 14.6 h. Food enhanced absorption by approximately twofold, while it delayed the time to the maximum concentration. The mean concentration at 24 h following the administration of a single 200-mg dose under fed conditions exceeded the in vitro protein binding-adjusted 90% inhibitory concentration by fourfold. The levels of plasma exposure were similar between the single dosing and the repeat dosing with 800 mg QD and was approximately twofold higher with 400 mg BID. Mean steady-state trough levels were 0.9 microg/ml (range, 0.2 to 2.5 microg/ml) and 2.1 microg/ml (range, 0.5 to 4.5 microg/ml) for the 800-mg QD and 400-mg BID regimens, respectively. The level of excretion of unchanged drug in urine was negligible. IDX899 was well tolerated; and no serious adverse events, dose-dependent adverse events, or laboratory abnormalities were detected. These favorable safety and pharmacokinetic results support further clinical studies with patients with HIV-1 infection by the use of a QD regimen.
