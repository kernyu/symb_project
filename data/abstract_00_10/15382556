Linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial agents, the oxazolidinones, to become available. Linezolid has a unique mechanism of action in its inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis in Gram-positive and a number of anaerobic bacteria. Because of this unique mechanism of action, linezolid exhibits no cross-resistance with other antibiotics and is effective against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The excellent bioavailability after oral administration (almost 100%) makes it suitable for outpatient treatment and treatment by general practitioners. In the Netherlands, however, the indications for linezolid are limited by its high cost, the availability of other effective antibiotics for the treatment of sensitive micro-organisms, and the toxicity associated with a prolonged treatment period. Resistance to the new agent was reported rather quickly after the introduction of linezolid.
