BACKGROUND: In the absence of randomized controlled trials with sufficient power to assess the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics (PA), the best evidence is provided by large population-based register studies. METHODS: The Swedish Register of Gallstone Surgery and ERCP (GallRiks) started in May 2005 and reached 75% national coverage in 2007. During 2006 and 2007, a total of 16,400 operations were registered in GallRiks. In the present study, all elective procedures performed in 2006-2007 in units performing at least 25 operations annually were included in an analysis of the risk for postoperative infectious complications RESULTS: Altogether 10,927 procedures were performed 2006-2007. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed a paradoxical increase in postoperative infectious complications requiring antibiotic treatment and postoperative abscess if PA were given (p < 0.05). This increase disappeared in multivariate analysis with adjustment for age, gender, presence of cholecystitis, accidental gallbladder perforation, and presence of bile duct stones. CONCLUSION: No benefit from PA was seen in this study on elective cholecystectomy. Although a randomized controlled trial could possibly show a reduction in the risk for postoperative infectious complications not detected in this study, such a reduction must be weighed against the risk of promoting drug resistance by the widespread use of PA.
