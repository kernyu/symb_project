For 60 minutes, a mycobacterial (MBT) clinical strain resistant to streptomycin (S), rifampicin (R), isoniazid (I) was treated with dissolved ozone (PO3) at the concentration used for intravenous injection in the clinic. Then the strain was added to the Lowenstein-Jesen solid medium containing different concentrations of antituberculous agents. Following 3 weeks, drug sensitivity was determined by the number of grown colonies. Then MBT were retreated with PO3 in the same fashion, by repeating the cycle three times. At week 3, a growth of over 100 colonies was recorded in all control cultures. After each PO3 treatment of the strain, there was a reduction in its resistance to I and R. After triple treatment, MBT sensitivity to I completely recovered. In the R-containing media, there was also decrease in drug resistance, but the latter remained high (640 mu/ml). S resistance substantially lowered after the second PO3 treatment, but it restored after the third one. A mechanism responsible for lower MBT resistance to I and R under the action of "therapeutical" concentrations of PO3 is analyzed. The paper discusses whether MBT resistance can be changes at the phenotypic level rather that at the genetic one.
