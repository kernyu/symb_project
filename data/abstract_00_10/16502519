In sexually transmitted infections and more precisely in uncomplicated urethritis and cervicitis, the two infectious agents most commonly identified in France are Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococci) and Chlamydia trachomatis, alone or associated. The resistance of N. gonorrhoeae to ciprofloxacin has reached over 20 % in France. A new national strategy for the therapeutic management of probabilistic treatment applied to uncomplicated urethritis and cervicitis is required. Bacteriological sampling before treatment is mandatory. Anti-gonococcal probabilistic treatment is a monodose using one of the following molecules: third generation cephalosporin: ceftriaxone (intra-muscular or intra-venous), cefixime (oral); aminoside: spectinomycin (intra- muscular); fluoroquinolone (bacteriologically controlled): ciprofloxacin (oral); An oral anti-Chlamydia treatment must be associated: azithromycin (monodose); or doxycycline (standard treatment). Blood tests (screening for syphilis, HIV infection, hepatitis B, hepatitis C) must be performed taking into account the delay for sero-conversion. Hepatitis B vaccination must be offered to any non-immunized patient. Protected intercourse (using condoms) must be recommended.
