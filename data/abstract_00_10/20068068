Type I IFNs (IFN-alpha/beta) are pleitropic cytokines widely used in the treatment of certain malignancies, hepatitis B and C, and multiple sclerosis. IFN resistance is a challenging clinical problem to overcome. Hence, understanding the molecular mechanism by which IFN immunotherapy ceases to be effective is of translational importance. In this study, we report that continuous IFN-alpha stimulation of the human Jurkat variant H123 led to resistance to type I IFN-induced apoptosis due to a loss of signal transducers and activators of transcription 2 (STAT2) expression. The apoptotic effects of IFN-alpha were hampered as STAT2-deficient cells were defective in activating the mitochondrial-dependent death pathway and ISGF3-mediated gene activation. Reconstitution of STAT2 restored the apoptotic effects of IFN-alpha as measured by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, caspase activation, and ultimately cell death. Nuclear localization of STAT2 was a critical event as retention of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT2 in the cytosol was not sufficient to activate apoptosis. Furthermore, silencing STAT2 gene expression in Saos2 and A375S.2 tumor cell lines significantly reduced the apoptotic capacity of IFN-alpha. Altogether, we show that STAT2 is a critical mediator in the activation of type I IFN-induced apoptosis. More importantly, defects in the expression or nuclear localization of STAT2 could lessen the efficacy of type I IFN immunotherapy.
