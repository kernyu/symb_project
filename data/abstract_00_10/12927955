The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against over 4900 bacterial isolates was determined by microbroth dilution with interpretation in accordance with NCCLS guidelines. Susceptibility results were compared with those for ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Gemifloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones were not affected by either beta-lactamase production or penicillin-resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MIC90 values for gemifloxacin were: S. pneumoniae 0.063 mg/l; Haemophilus influenzae 0.016 mg/l; Moraxella catarrhalis 0.008 mg/l, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 0.063 mg/l; methicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes 0.031 mg/l; Enterobacteriaceae 0.031-0.16 mg/l; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 mg/l; Neisseria meningitidis 0.008 mg/l. The MIC90 for gemifloxacin was lower than those for the other quinolones tested against S. pneumoniae (ciprofloxacin 2-4 mg/l, gatifloxacin 0.5 mg/l, levofloxacin 1-2 mg/l, moxifloxacin 0.25 mg/l). This study confirms the enhanced potent activity of gemifloxacin against Gram-positive pathogens, its broad-spectrum, Gram-negative activity and indicates that gemifloxacin is likely to have an important role in treating patients with Gram-positive and/or Gram-negative infections.
