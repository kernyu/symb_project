Mutations selected or deselected during passage of human immunodeficiency virus strain HXB2 or resistant variants with tenofovir (TFV), abacavir (ABC), and lamivudine (3TC) differed depending on the drug combination and virus genotype. In the wild-type virus, TFV-ABC and TFV-3TC selected K65R (with reduced susceptibility to all three inhibitors) and then Y115F. TFV-containing regimens might increase K65R selection, which confers multiple nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance.
