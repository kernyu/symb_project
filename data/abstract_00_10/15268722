Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a serious problem in lung transplant recipients. Development of potent oral antiviral agents, molecular techniques for the detection of infection and its response to therapy and the emergence of isolates with antiviral resistance have had significant impacts on the approach to CMV in these patients. This article discusses the following issues as part of a comprehensive CMV management strategy in lung transplant recipients: (1) Prevention strategies in the era of potent oral antiviral agents, (2) the role of new diagnostic techniques in the management of CMV, (3) treatment regimens for established CMV infection or disease, (4) the potential impact of treatment of CMV on the indirect effects on long-term allograft function, and (5) the incidence, risk factors for and impact of ganciclovir resistance following lung transplantation.
