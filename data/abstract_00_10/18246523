Forest Laboratories (following its acquisition of Cerexa Inc, a spin-out from Peninsula Pharmaceuticals Inc), under license from Takeda, is developing ceftaroline fosamil, an N-phosphono prodrug of ceftaroline, a derivative of a fourth-generation cephalosporin, for the potential treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. Phase III clinical trials evaluating ceftaroline fosamil for community acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections are underway.
