We describe a large outbreak involving a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain producing a plasmid-encoded ACC-1 type AmpC beta-lactamase in a hospital caring for patients with motor impairment. The epidemic strain was isolated from 57 patients in six wards between September 1999 and May 2003 and caused clinical infections in 19 patients.
