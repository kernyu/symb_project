Studies of group B streptococci (GBS) have been limited in Korea, despite the necessity for such studies because of the increase in serious adult infections, the emergence of new serotypes, and the increase of resistance to certain antibiotics. In this study, trends in serotypes of GBS isolated in Korea were compared to determine any changes and emergence of new types, while antimicrobial susceptibility was tested and compared with that of group A streptococci (GAS). It was found that the most frequent infections caused by GBS were of the urinary tract, but other severe infections also occurred not only in newborns but also in adults. The prevalent serotypes were still Ia, Ib, and III, while new serotypes, VI and VIII, also emerged. GBS were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, but were much less so than GAS. The resistance rates to erythromycin and tetracycline were much higher than those in other countries, suggesting that these antibiotics are no longer very useful in Korea for the treatment of GBS infections.
