The full extent of anthelmintic resistance in nematodes of farm animals is not known. Resistance can be detected with a faecal egg count reduction test and two in vitro tests, the egg hatch and larval development tests. The sensitivity of these two in vitro tests can be increased by using discriminating doses rather than calculating LD50 values. Only benzimidazole resistance can be detected with PCR based tests because the molecular mechanisms of resistance to levamisole and the macrocyclic lactones remain unknown. Resistance detection is important because it enables the appropriate management strategies to be put in place. The development of resistance is delayed by keeping sufficient parasites in refugia (not exposed to anthelmintic), but the necessary management details have not yet been validated in the field. It is probably too late to use combination products to delay the development of resistance, except in cattle but quarantining animals to prevent introduction of resistant helminths onto a farm is important. Dilution of resistant worms with susceptible ones is only at the preliminary research stage and the application of non-chemical methods of control to delay resistance is not yet a practical option. Extensive research is required to manage resistance, especially in the control of resistance in Fasciola hepatica.
