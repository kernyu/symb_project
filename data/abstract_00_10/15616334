In100, a new integron carrying a carbapenemase gene (bla(VIM-2)) associated with a carbenicillinase (blaP1b) and aminoglycoside resistance genes (aacA4 and aadA2), was detected in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate. The particular gene cassette organization of In100 seems to reflect the evolution of antibiotic usage in therapeutics.
