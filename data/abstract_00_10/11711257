Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n=1191) were collected during a 1997-1999 European surveillance study. In addition to susceptibility data, a molecular epidemiological survey of their mechanisms of resistance to macrolides, tetracyclines, and quinolones was provided. Of the isolates tested, 72.6% were penicillin-susceptible, 19.9% penicillin-intermediate and 7.5% penicillin-resistant. There was an obvious relationship between resistance to penicillin and resistance to erythromycin (19% of all isolates), clindamycin (14%) and tetracycline (23%). Only one isolate was resistant to levofloxacin. Seventy-three percent of the European S. pneumoniae isolates resistant to erythromycin (n=229) carried the erm(B) gene, while the remaining 27% possessed the mef(A) gene. No mutations were detected in 23S rRNA or in ribosomal proteins L4 and L22. All tetracycline-resistant isolates (n=277) carried the tet(M) gene; none carried the tet(O) gene. Classical mutations in gyrA (Ser 81-Phe or Tyr) and parC (Ser 79-Phe and Asp 83-Asn) and efflux contributed to the decreased quinolone susceptibility. This study of recent European S. pneumoniae isolates can be used to recognize any changes in susceptibility patterns and resistance mechanisms that may occur in the future.
