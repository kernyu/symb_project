Levofloxacin has been reported to have in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. A recent survey carried out at our Institution showed clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to be more susceptible to levofloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. The in vitro activity of the two fluoroquinolones was evaluated further by looking at their bactericidal activity against two strains of each of the following antibio-phenotypes of P. aeruginosa: levofloxacin- and ciprofloxacin-susceptible, levofloxacin-susceptible/ciprofloxacin-resistant, levofloxacin-susceptible/ciprofloxacin-susceptible and ceftazidime-resistant, (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards susceptibility breakpoints were used). MIC and MBC values were measured and time-kill experiments were carried out. Drugs were used at susceptibility or resistance breakpoint concentrations in the time-kill experiments and results were recorded over 12 h in an attempt to link in vitro results with the clinical situation The polypeptide profiles of outer membrane preparations of the six strains were examined by gel electrophoresis. Levofloxacin was shown to be more bactericidal than ciprofloxacin in the time-kill experiments. No differences were observed between the outer membrane proteins of the six strains. Levofloxacin showed greater bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates than ciprofloxacin.
