The biological properties of vaginal lactobacilli strains with different colonization capacity were studied. As revealed in this study, colonization depended on the characteristics of species, individual elements of intrageneric antagonism, adhesion, resistance to antibacterial factors and the capacity for producing lysozyme. These properties of lactobacilli ensured the possibility of their adaptation to the conditions of the environment, manifested by its bacterial contamination. The data obtained in this study may be used for the study of symbiotic relationships between nonpathogenic bacteria with the host organism.
