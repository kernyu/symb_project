Reverse transcription of HIV-1 into double-stranded DNA involves initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis at the polypurine tract, PPT, by reverse transcriptase (RT). The PPT is a possible target for triple-helix formation. We show the effects of triple-helix formation by assays of RNase H cleavage inhibition in vitro using two systems (two-strand-system (FTFOs) or three-strand-system (TFOs)) targeted to the polypurine tract (PPT) of HIV-1. The two-stranded composition of a triple-helix is thermodynamically and kinetically superior to the three-strand-system. The FTFOs inhibited the RNase H activity in a sequence-specific manner, i.e., the triplex actually formed at the PPT and blocked the RNase H. The FTFOs containing the phosphorothioate groups at the antisense strand showed greater 3'-exonuclease resistance. In HIV-1 infected MT-4 cells, the FTFOs containing the phosphorothioate groups at the antisense strand and guanosine rich parts within the third Hoogsteen base pairing sequence inhibit the replication of HIV-1 more effectively than the antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, indicating sequence-specific inhibition of HIV-1 replication.
