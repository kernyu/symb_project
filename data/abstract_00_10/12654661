A Salmonella enterica serotype Cubana isolate exhibiting resistance to most beta-lactam antibiotics, including oxyimino-cephalosporins and imipenem, was isolated from a 4-year-old boy with gastroenteritis in Maryland. beta-Lactam resistance was mediated by a conjugative plasmid that encoded KPC-2, a class A carbapenemase previously found in a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from the Maryland area as well. Sequence analysis of the flanking regions indicated a potential association of bla(KPC-2) with mobile structures.
