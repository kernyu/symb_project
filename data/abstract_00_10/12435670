Among 730 Escherichia coli, 438 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 141 Proteus mirabilis isolates obtained between September 2000 and September 2001 in seven hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, 26.6% were resistant to ceftazidime, 30% were resistant to cefotaxime, 31.5% were resistant to ceftriaxone, 15.9% were resistant to cefoperazone, and 6% were resistant to cefepime. Resistance to imipenem was found in 5.6% of the isolates. In 55 strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (32 E. coli isolates, 13 K. pneumoniae isolates, and 10 P. mirabilis isolates), structural genes for VEB-1 (25.5%), CTX-M (25.5%), SHV (38.1%), and TEM (76.3%) enzymes were detected alone or in combination. Sequencing of the PCR products obtained from the K. pneumoniae isolates revealed the presence of bla(VEB-1), bla(CTX-M-14), bla(CTX-M-17), bla(SHV-2), and bla(TEM-1). Molecular typing of the strains with a similar resistance phenotype to broad-spectrum cephalosporins indicated polyclonal spread. ISEcp1 was presumably responsible for dissemination of the bla(CTX-M-like) gene.
