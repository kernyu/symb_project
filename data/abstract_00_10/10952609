Forty clonally related clinical isolates of Escherichia coli from hospitalized patients were resistant to cefoxitin (MICs, >256 microg/ml) and ceftazidime (MICs, 32 to 256 microg/ml) and were intermediate or resistant to cefotaxime (MICs, 16 to 128 microg/ml) but susceptible to both cefepime (MICs, 0.5 to 2 microg/ml) and imipenem (MICs, 0.125 to 0.25 microg/ml). Resistance to beta-lactams was related to high-level production of AmpC beta-lactamase and loss of OmpF porin.
