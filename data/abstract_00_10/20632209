Resistance to the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species produced by phagocytes and production of hydrolytic enzymes are important aspects of Candida albicans virulence. In this report, we compared twelve C. albicans isolates for their in vitro capacity to resist oxidants-hydrogen peroxide, menadione and paraquat; and to produce hydrolytic enzymes-phospholipase and protease. Different C. albicans isolates showed different degrees of resistance to oxidants as well as differences in production of hydrolytic enzymes. Resistance to oxidative stress did not correlate with production of hydrolytic enzymes. This reinforces the view that C. albicans differentially regulates the expression of virulence factors in response to local environmental conditions.
