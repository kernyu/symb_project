Knowledge about survival of micro-organisms in stressful situations not only influences the evolutionary theory in a fundamental way, but bears an extraordinary importance in finding a global solution to a very concrete urgent problem of mankind, namely bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Recent in vitro experiments demonstrate that the adaptive mutation process involving transient hypermutators could be one of the most important mechanisms whereby bacterial cells achieve the antibiotic resistance. An effective response of the mutation rates to specific selective conditions and an increasing number of conclusive evidence that bacterial cells are indeed communicative and co-operative organisms lead us to a hypothesis that the emergence of the antibiotic resistant mutants through the so-called adaptive mutation is deeply connected with the multicellular organisation of bacterial cells.
