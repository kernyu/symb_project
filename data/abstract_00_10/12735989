Crystalline 1 (TAK-599) is a novel N-phosphono prodrug of anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cephalosporin 2a (T-91825) that has high affinity for penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2' (IC(50); 0.90 microg/mL) and shows potent in vitro anti-MRSA activity (MIC against MRSA N133; 1.56 microg/mL), comparable to that of vancomycin (1.56 microg/mL). Although 2a had insufficient water solubility (2.3 mg/mL) for parenteral administration, 1 showed excellent water solubility (>100 mg/mL, pH 7) as well as good chemical stability in the solid state and solution. In pharmacokinetic studies, when 1 was administered intravenously to rats and monkeys, it was rapidly converted into 2a in the blood. These results show that 1 (TAK-599) is a highly promising parenteral cephalosporin targeted for MRSA infection.
