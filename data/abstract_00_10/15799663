BACKGROUND: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis affects up to 5% of premenopausal women. It is often associated with significant morbidity and may be difficult to manage. OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the pathogenesis investigations and management of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. DISCUSSION: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis may be misdiagnosed as presenting signs and symptoms are not specific. Examination and microbial testing are required to confirm the diagnosis. Some women appear to have an abnormal host response to the presence of candida species in the vagina, making them susceptible to recurrent episodes of symptomatic infection. Women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis generally respond to a course of suppressive treatment, but many relapse after ceasing therapy.
