Mycobacterium bovis is best identified by screening those isolates of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex that have any pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance, using a confirmatory test such as spoligotyping, biochemical testing, or genomic deletion analysis. The sensitivity for detection of M. bovis is lowered to 82% when only PZA-monoresistant isolates are screened.
