Two hundred and fifty-four patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, treated with reserve antituberculous drugs due to multidrug resistance, the ineffective prior stage of treatment, or intractable adverse reactions, were examined. Aminoglycosides and capreomycin were administered. Combinations simultaneously included 5-7 drugs. Adverse reactions were developed in 72.8% of the patients to different drugs and in different periods. Adverse gastrointestinal, renal, central nervous system, and auditory reactions of reserve drugs were most commonly detected. Essential were also electrolyte metabolic disturbances, hypothyroidism (when reserve drugs were given), intestinal dysbacteriosis, and allergic reactions. The paper analyzes the pattern of adverse reactions caused by each preparation, the time of their occurrence, and methods for their elimination in detail. Adverse reactions to reserve drugs exerted a negative effect of the efficiency of the chemotherapy performed.
