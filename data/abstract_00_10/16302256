Deformability of erythrocyte was found to fundamentally alter the wetting dynamics of red blood cell (RBC) suspensions during their invasion into capillaries. Normal RBC suspensions failed to penetrate more than 1 cm into a glass capillary when the capillary radius was smaller than a critical value that is dependent on the erythrocyte concentration (about 50 microm for whole blood). In contrast, suspensions of rigidified RBCs, after cross-linking with different concentrations of glutaraldehyde or incubating with 100 ng/mL of an endotoxin, could penetrate any capillary larger than the erythrocyte dimension. The effect of RBC deformability on penetration was attributed to the enhanced shear-induced migration of normal deformable RBCs toward the capillary centreline, which imparted a higher average velocity to the RBCs than the average plasma velocity. As a result, the erythrocytes advanced into the capillary faster than the wetting meniscus, packing behind it to form a concentrated slug. This tightly packed slug had a high hydrodynamic resistance that could arrest the penetrating flow of concentrated suspensions into the small capillaries.
