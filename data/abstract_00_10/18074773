The influence of H2O2 at concentrations of 10(-8)--10(-2) mol/l on neutrophil ability to generate the reactive oxygen and chlorine species (ROCS) and secrete myeloperoxidase (MPO) was studied, and H202 injurious effect on neutrophils was also investigated in this work. It was revealed that H2O2 at concentrations of 2 x 10(-3)--2 x 10(-2) mol/l induced disturbance of the neutrophil membrane barrier properties and lactate dehydrogenase release. The incubation of the neutrophils with the addition of 10(-4)--10(-7) mol/l H2O2 led to an increase in the cell ability to generate ROCS during phagocytosis and decreased neutrophil ability to secrete MPO and ROCS in extracellular medium during adhesion. The mechanisms of H2O2 effect are coupled with arachidonic acid metabolism. Inhibition of metabolic pathways of 5-lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase increased the destructive effect of H2O2 on the cells. Five-lipoxygenase way prohibition led to cancellation of H2O2 influence on MPO and ROCS secretion and to enhancement of H2O2 effect on neutrophil ability to generate ROCS during phagocytosis. The data obtained testify to the high neutrophil resistance to destructive effect of H2O2 and confirm the regulatory role of H2O2 with respect to the neutrophil functions.
