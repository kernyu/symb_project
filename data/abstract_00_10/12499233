In Hong Kong, ParC changes among high-level quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (QRNG) isolates at Ser-87-->Arg were associated with a higher level of resistance than a Ser-87-->Ile alteration. Two previously undescribed mutations in clinical isolates occurring in gyrA, conferring Ala-92-->Pro and Asp-95-->Tyr changes, were detected. Nine different outer membrane lipoprotein (Lip) repeat classes-11 to 19 repeats-were identified, with repeat lengths of 16 and 17 the most common, indicating considerable strain diversity.
