In 2003, primary health care reported 230,356 (2.7% of diagnosed diseases and conditions) cases of urinary bladder infections in Croatia. Results of this study including 815 outpatient urine samples confirmed the diagnosis of urinary system infection in 27.4%. Positive urine cultures were recorded in 32.8% of female and 20.1% of male patients, Escherichia (E.) coli and Enterococcus spp. with 67.3% and 12.6%, respectively were the most common causative agents of urinary system infection. Considering the efficacy of antibiotic action on individual pathogenic isolates, sulphametoxazole-trimethroprim showed high efficacy (94.3%) against E. coli strains. Th diagnosis of cystitis is established more often than confirmed by study the findings. Urine culture makes a considerable contribution to the diagnosis, rationalizing the costs of treatment by preventing the unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics and the development of antibiotic resistance. Thus it is necessary to make it fully accessible. Application of the current state-of-the-art in patients attending primary health care clinics, should be enabled by proactive or interactive measurable use of (on-line) guidelines on the treatment of urinary tract infections.
