CASE DESCRIPTION: A 2-year-old dog was evaluated because of complications that developed following tibial plateau leveling osteotomy. Infection of the surgical site developed following removal of the failed implant. CLINICAL FINDINGS: The dog was lame with evidence of a deep surgical site infection, and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was isolated from the surgical site. Results of in vitro testing indicated that the isolate was resistant to multiple antimicrobials but susceptible to cefoxitin. Subsequent testing confirmed that the isolate was methicillin-resistant S pseudintermedius and was in fact resistant to cefoxitin. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: On the basis of results of follow-up testing, doxycycline was administered before and after surgery to remove the surgical implant. The dog recovered without further complications. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Findings suggested that certain strains of methicillin-resistant S pseudintermedius, which appears to be an emerging pathogen in dogs, may be falsely identified as methicillin susceptible on the basis of results of testing for cefoxitin susceptibility because cefoxitin may not induce the mecA gene as reliably in S pseudintermedius as it does in Staphylococcus aureus. Isolates of S pseudintermedius should be considered to likely be methicillin resistant when multidrug resistance is identified, even if susceptibility to some beta-lactam antimicrobials is reported.
