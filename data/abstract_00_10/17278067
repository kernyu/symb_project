Since the establishment of the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) in 1996, it has been an essential resource for the surveillance and investigation of foodborne disease in the United States. FoodNet has had a major impact on food safety because it conducts population-based, active surveillance for laboratory-confirmed infections from 9 pathogens commonly transmitted through food. Each year, FoodNet publishes the National Report Card on Food Safety, which is used by regulatory agencies, industry and consumer groups, and public health personnel to prioritize and evaluate food safety interventions and monitor progress toward national health objectives. FoodNet also determines the human-health impact of foodborne illness by conducting related epidemiological studies that contribute to the estimates of the overall burden of foodborne illness, attribute the burden of foodborne illness to specific foods and settings, and address important foodborne disease-related issues, such as antimicrobial resistance and sequelae from foodborne infections. This article summarizes the activities, achievements, and lessons learned during the first 10 years of FoodNet.
