RNA interference (RNAi) has been extremely effective against hepatitis C viral (HCV) gene expression in short-term cell culture. Our aim was to determine whether long-term RNAi might result in HCV-resistant mutants. Huh7 HCV subgenomic replicon cells were transfected with short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). HCV-RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR, and HCV NS5A levels were assayed by Western blots using specific antibody. Treatment with HCV-siRNA resulted in a 50% inhibition of HCV-RNA levels compared with pretreatment levels after 4 weeks (P < 0.05). HCV-RNA returned to 85% of pretreatment levels after cessation of HCV-siRNA treatment. Sequencing of the HCV-siRNA target and upstream region was performed on 10 colonies from subcloning using PCR products, each before, during and after siRNA treatment. All colonies except one from HCV-siRNA-treated cells during and after treatment had mutations. There were no mutations in the HCV-siRNA target region following control HBV-siRNA treatment. Subcloned replicon cells containing the point mutations in the target region were found to be resistant to HCV-siRNA inhibitory effects. In conclusion, even after 4 weeks of treatment of replicon cells with HCV-siRNA, HCV-RNA and HCV-NS5A protein expression could not be completely eliminated. HCV replicons isolated during or after treatment were associated with mutations in the siRNA target region, while controls were not.
