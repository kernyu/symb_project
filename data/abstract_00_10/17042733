OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of common respiratory tract pathogens from sheep and goats. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SAMPLE POPULATION: 41 respiratory tract isolates from sheep and 36 isolates from goats. PROCEDURES: Disk diffusion assay was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, ciprofloxacin, florfenicol, and tetracycline. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of florfenicol for these isolates were determined by use of the microbroth dilution technique. RESULTS: The most common isolates were Pasteurella multocida (n = 28) and Mannheimia haemolytica (39). All isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, ciprofloxacin, and florfenicol. Five percent (4/77) of isolates were resistant to tetracycline. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens isolated from sheep and goats to commonly used antimicrobial drugs in this study was high. Treatment of these species for bacterial respiratory tract disease is likely not complicated by antimicrobial resistance.
