This study was conducted in 124 children with meningitis to review the etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility and outcome of disease in a Nigerian tertiary health facility. Of these, 97 (78.27%) were culture positive; in the rest 27(21.8%), diagnosis was based on Gram staining of the CSF. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were isolated in 33.9%, 33.9%, 5.6%, 2.4%, and 2.4% samples respectively. All the isolates had 100 percent; sensitivity to both ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin while the sensitivities to penicillin and ampicillin were remarkably low. The mortality was 33/124 (26.6%) while 16/ 91 (17.6%) of the survivors had various neurologic sequelae.
