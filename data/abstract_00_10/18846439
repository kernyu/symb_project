Bacteria growing in biofilms can become up to 1000-fold more resistant to antibiotics and biocides as compared to their planktonic counterparts. As a result of this increased resistance, biofilms and biofilm-related infections cannot be effectively treated with conventional antibiotic therapy. The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of three neutral pH, super-oxidised solutions (nSOSs, OIS-80, OIS-125, OIS-200, Microcyn Technology) varying in oxychlorine concentration (80, 125 and 200 ppm) against P. aeruginosa grown planktonically and as biofilms. Exposure for 20 s of exponential phase cells to any of the three solutions was sufficient to reduce viability by more than five logs. However, only exposure for 10 min to OIS-125 and OIS-200 for 10 min was sufficient to eradicate stationary phase P. aeruginosa cells. The efficacy of nSOSs on P. aeruginosa biofilms, grown to maturity in continuous flow tube reactors, was determined upon treatment up to 60 min. Viability pre- and post-treatment was determined by CFU counts. The effect of these solutions on P. aeruginosa biofilms and biofilm architecture was further visualised by confocal scanning laser microscopy and quantitatively analysed by COMSTAT. Under these experimental conditions, only OIS-125 and OIS-200 achieved a >3-log reduction and biofilm disaggregation within 30 min of exposure. Because OIS-125 and OIS-200 enhance the disaggregation of biofilms, their use in the treatment of surface-related biofilm infections deserves further investigation.
