Infections with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-Acinetobacter calcoaceticus complex bacteria complicate the care of U.S. military personnel and civilians worldwide. One hundred thirty-three isolates from 89 patients at our facility during 2006 and 2007 were tested by disk diffusion, Etest, and broth microdilution for susceptibility to tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, and tigecycline. Minocycline was the most active in vitro, with 90% of the isolates tested susceptible. Susceptibilities varied significantly with the testing method. The acquired tetracycline resistance genes tetA, tetB, and tetA(39) were present in the isolates.
