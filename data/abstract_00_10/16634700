Otitis media is one of the most common disorders occurring in children, and there is growing concern that bacteria are quickly becoming resistant to antimicrobials. As a result, global antibiotic treatment is no longer the standard of care and treatment of otitis media has changed dramatically in the last decade. In addition to new antimicrobials currently in development, the effects of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine are just beginning to be understood. Furthermore, new surgical techniques are for the first time being tested as alternatives for tympanostomy tubes for recurrent acute otitis media. This review discusses current and emerging otitis media therapeutics, with particular attention to acute otitis media. Topics include antimicrobial use, antimicrobial resistance, effects of vaccination and new surgical techniques.
