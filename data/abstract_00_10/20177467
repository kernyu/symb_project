In a wide search program towards new and efficient antibacterial agents, we assessed the extent to which physicochemical properties can be exploited to promote antibacterial activity associated with a series of substituted s-triazine. The synthesized compounds (1a-12b) were subsequently screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against three gram positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus) and three Gram-negative microorganism (Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes) by the broth dilution technique, recommended by European Committee for antimicrobial susceptibility testing with reference to streptomycin.
