OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori is considered as an important etiologic factor in pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis and gastric cancer. To eradicate this micro-organism, numerous regimens containing various antimicrobial agents have been suggested. However, H pylori antimicrobial resistance is a leading factor to treatment failure and recurrence of the disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of H pylori resistance to metronidazole, clarithromycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, erythromycin and furazolidone in authors pediatric patients. METHODS: Antral biopsy of all pediatric patients with negative history of receiving anti-H pylori regimen and endoscopic findings of nodular gastritis or peptic ulcer without previous history of NSAID consumption, burning and trauma were performed for H pylori histology, urease test and culture. All positive cultures were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Twenty four patients (14 male and 10 female) between 3.5 and 14 years of age were culture positive. 54.16% of the isolates were resistant to metronidazole, 8.33% to amoxicillin, 4.16% to erythromycin and 4.16% to clarithromycin. None of authors patients were resistant to tetracycline and furazolidone. CONCLUSION: H. pylori antimicrobial resistance could be a major contributor to failure of H pylori eradication. Continuous prospective surveillance of H. Pylori is essential. Moreover, culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test is recommended for resistant cases after the first failure to therapy.
