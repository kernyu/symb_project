The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between ATP-based chemotherapy response assay (ATP-CRA) results and clinical outcomes in ovarian cancer. Twenty-nine fresh tumor specimens were collected. Tumor cells were isolated and cultured for 48 hrs in medium containing anticancer drugs. The median age of patients was 56 years. The sensitivity, positive predictive value, and accuracy of ATP-CRA were respectively 94.1%, 94.1%, and 90.0%. There was a significant relationship between ATP-CRA results and clinical responses (p = 0.046). This study suggests that ATP-CRA has high sensitivity, positive predictive value, and accuracy for predicting response to chemotherapy in ovarian cancer.
