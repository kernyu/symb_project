Amphotericin B is the primary antifungal agent used for candida sepsis in neonates. Breakthrough candidemia was not reported in neonates during either amphotericin B or liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) treatment. We describe a case of a premature infant with congenital cutaneous candida infection, who had two episodes of breakthrough infection, from Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis, while he was treated with amphotericin B and AmBisome, respectively. We discuss the pathogenesis of breakthrough infections, and the relevance of antifungal resistance and sensitivities testing.
