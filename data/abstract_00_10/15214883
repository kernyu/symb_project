Between January 1993 and December 2001, the overall frequency of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, rose from 2.4% to 7.4%. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most prevalent species (56%), followed by Escherichia coli (15%) and Proteus mirabilis (9%). A rate of 49% was observed among isolates from paediatric patients in 1999, caused mostly by outbreaks in the neonatal intensive care unit of K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis isolates that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
