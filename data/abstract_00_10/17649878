OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bacterial flora and their drug resistance in hospitalized burn patients on tropical islands. METHODS: Retrospective study was carried out to analyze pathogenic microorganisms and their drug resistance characteristics in 392 burn patients hospitalized during 2000-2005. RESULTS: (1) Totally 671 strains of bacteria were isolated, among which Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Aerobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter species were predominant, but the isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was declining compared with that in 1990's. (2) The resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to imipenem and cefepime was 32.2% and 36.7% , respectively, while that to other antibiotics was above 80%. (3) Among 141 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 89 strains (63.1%) of MRSA were isolated, and none of them were resistant to Vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Aerobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter species were predominant in tropical islands. The species of the pathogens are changing . The drug resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are rather high.
