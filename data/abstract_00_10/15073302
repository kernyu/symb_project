A link between control of respiration and glucose repression in yeast is reported. The HAP4 gene was overexpressed in a Delta mig1 deletion background, generating a mutant in which respiratory function is stimulated and glucose repression is diminished. Although this combination does not result in derepression of genes encoding proteins involved in respiratory function, it nevertheless generates resistance against 2-deoxyglucose and hence contributes to more derepressed growth characteristics. Unexpectedly, overexpression of HAP4 in the Delta mig1 deletion strain causes strong repression of several target genes of the Mig1p repressor. Repression is not restricted to glucose growth conditions and does not require the glucose repressors Mig2p or Hxk2p. It was observed that expression of the SUC2 gene is transiently repressed after glucose is added to respiratory-growing Delta mig1 cells. Additional overexpression of HAP4 prevents release from this novel repressed state. The data presented show that respiratory function controls transcription of genes required for the metabolism of alternative sugars. This respiratory feedback control is suggested to regulate the feed into glycolysis in derepressed conditions.
