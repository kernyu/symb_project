Among new available antifungal agents voriconazole is a new triazole with an intravenous (i.v.) and oral formulation, and caspofungin is an echinocandin, new family with a new mode of action on the cell wall. It is available as an i.v. preparation. Both drugs have a broad spectrum targeting most of the usual pathogens: Candida and Aspergillus, even with low suceptibility or resistance to other antifungals. Voriconazole is also active on Scedosporium and Fusarium. The efficacy of these molecules was established in vitro and in experimental infections in animals either normal or immunosuppressed. Voriconazole is active in oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis, in refractory invasive candidiasis and as a first line treatment of invasive aspergillosis with better results than amphotericine B. It was also effective in scedosporiosis and in fusariosis. Caspofungin is active in oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis, in invasive candidiasis ranking among the best drugs in non neutropenic patients. It was shown effective in refractory aspergillosis. As empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic patients, these molecules should probably be restricted to the highest risk-population. Safety is good, side effects are a rare cause of discontinuation of treatment, class specific drug-drug interactions occur with voriconazole. These molecules open an important field of investigations with combination of antifungal agents.
