We report a rare case of meningitis caused by Enterococcus gallinarum, a bacterium characterized by its ability to express low-level resistance to vancomycin. As in the three other previously reported cases, this one occurred in a patient with a cerebrospinal fluid drainage catheter and properly responded to antimicrobial therapy and removal of the drain.
