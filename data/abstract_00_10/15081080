Seventy-three Salmonella isolates classified as ciprofloxacin susceptible when using the criteria of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards were studied for nalidixic acid (NA) resistance. The aim of the study was to determine the predictive value of nalidixic acid resistance in screening for decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility. We observed that isolates with decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility were all resistant to nalidixic acid. Identification of nalidixic acid resistance by the disk diffusion method provided 100% sensitivity and a specificity of 98.4% in strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) >0.008 mg/l.
