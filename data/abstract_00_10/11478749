Helicobacter pylori is a serious, chronic, progressive, and transmissible infection associated with a significant morbidity and mortality, which alone emphasizes the priority of developing adequate prophylactic or therapeutic measures. What was previously termed "asymptomatic H. pylori infection" is now recognized as a latent infection, and it is now accepted that the presence of an H. pylori infection is an indication for eradication therapy. Successful cure of H. pylori infection requires 2 or more antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is the major impediment of cure. The ideal duration of therapy is unknown, but in general, 1 week therapy is less effective than longer durations. Compliance is important for the success of treatment; therefore, the favored regimen should have the least side effects. At present, a proton pump inhibitor (or ranitidine bismuth citrate)-clarithromycin triple therapy with either amoxicillin or metronidazole, for at least 10 days is considered first-line therapy. The alternative is quadruple therapy containing a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, tetracycline, and a higher dose of metronidazole. Quadruple therapy is the best choice after failure of proton pump inhibitor-clarithromycin triple therapy. Confirmation of successful therapy with a urea breath test or a stool antigen test is now the standard of practice.
