Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) represents an adjuvant therapy of proven effectiveness in increasing disease-free interval and survival in subgroups of melanoma patients. Since high doses of cytokine are required, the treatment is often accompanied by toxic side effects. Furthermore, naturally occurring insensitivity to IFN-alpha may hamper its therapeutic efficacy. Clinical, molecular or immunological markers enabling the selection of potential responders have not been identified so far. To explore the molecular basis of IFN-alpha responsiveness, we analysed the expression pattern of about 7000 genes in IFN-alpha sensitive and resistant cell lines and we compared the transcription profiles of cells cultured in the presence or absence of the cytokine using high-density oligonucleotide arrays. Melanoma cell lines were screened for their sensitivity to proliferation inhibition and HLA class I induction upon IFN-alpha treatment by standard 3H-thymidine incorporation and flow-cytometry. The study of 4 sensitive and 2 resistant cell lines allowed the identification of 4 genes (RCC1, IFI16, hox2 and h19) preferentially transcribed in sensitive cells and 2 (SHB and PKC-zeta) preferentially expressed in resistant cells. IFN-alpha stimulation resulted in the expression of a panel of 19 known inducible genes in sensitive but not in resistant cells. Moreover a group of 30 novel IFN-alpha inducible genes was identified. These data may provide a useful basis to develop diagnostic tools to select potential IFN-alpha responders eligible for treatment, while avoiding unnecessary toxicity to non-responders. Furthermore, by extending the knowledge of the polymorphic effects of IFN-alpha on gene expression, they offer novel clues to the study of its pleiotropic toxicity.
