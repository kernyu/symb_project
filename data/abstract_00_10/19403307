A series of novel 2-aryl-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno[3,2-b]indoles has been synthesised regioselectively in good yields from the reaction of 5-aryldihydro-3(2H)-thiophenones and arylhydrazine hydrochloride. This reaction is found to be assisted by microwaves. The thieno[3,2-b]indoles were evaluated for their in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB) and multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Among 22 compounds screened, [2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-7-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno[3,2-b]indole] (6t) was found to the most active compound with MIC of 0.4 microg/mL against MTB and MDR-TB.
