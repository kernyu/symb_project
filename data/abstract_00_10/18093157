The occurrence and diversity of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in wastewaters from the Brighton and Hove area of south-east England were investigated. VRE were recovered from 71% of raw urban wastewater samples, 22% of treated urban wastewater samples, 15% of hospital wastewater sample and 33% of farm wastewater samples. Two hundred and eighty-eight isolates were typed and identified and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to six antibiotics were determined for selected VRE. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) strains with a vancomycin MIC of more than 32 mug ml(-1) were examined by polymerase chain reaction for the vanA, vanB and esp genes. Twenty-three VREF with the vanA or vanB gene were further analysed by multilocus sequence typing which revealed that a cluster of VREF from both hospital and urban wastewaters belonged to the high-risk, epidemic, clonal complex-17 (CC17). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium belonging to the CC17 group contained the purK-1 allele, were resistant to ampicillin and frequently ciprofloxacin, and usually contained the esp gene. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of CC17 strains isolated from urban wastewaters in the UK, and indicates that certain clones carrying antibiotic resistance or virulence traits indicative of the hospital environment can be detected in the urban wastewater system.
