Antiviral drugs against DNA viruses are widely used for the management of diseases caused by infections with the Herpes viruses and have recently been introduced for Hepatitis B. There are also several emerging treatments (i.e. those that are in clinical development) and novel treatments that are still in the preclinical phase. Although the majority of emerging drugs are nucleoside analogues, there is a trend towards the development of non-nucleosidic drugs with unique mechanisms of action, in the hope that efficacy will be maximised and drug resistance and viral rebound minimised.
