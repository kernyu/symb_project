Drp35 has been identified as a protein that is induced in Staphylococcus aureus in response to exposure to certain antibiotics. Here we demonstrate that Drp35 is a lactonase that does not contribute directly to the resistance to the inducer antibiotics except for bacitracin. The detailed analysis on the expression of Drp35 revealed that in addition to a broad range of antibiotics, agents such as detergents that perturb the membrane integrity could induce its expression. The significance of this characteristic expression is discussed in relation to its activity similarity to the eukaryotic counterparts, paraoxonase family proteins.
