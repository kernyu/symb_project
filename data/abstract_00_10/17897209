AIMS: The aim of this work was to establish if the response to tetradecyltrimethylammonium (TDTMA), a representative quaternary ammonium compound (QAC), involves changes in the phospholipid (PL) composition of Pseudomonas putida A ATCC 12633. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pseudomonas putida was exposed to 50 mg l(-1) of TDTMA for 15 min, and PL composition was analysed. With respect to control values, phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylglycerol increased by 140% and 120%, respectively; cardiolipin decreased about 60%. In TDTMA-adapted bacteria, the most significant change was a 380% increase in phosphatidic acid. Accompanying this change was a 130% increase in phosphatidylglycerol and a 70% decrease in cardiolipin. The changes in adapted cells were reverted after two subcultures without biocide. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas putida responded to TDTMA through quantitative changes in PLs with specific variations in the content of phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. These modifications indicated that these PLs are involved in cellular responses to QACs, utilizing phosphatidic acid principally to neutralize the high positive charge density given for the ammonium quaternary moiety from TDTMA. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The changes in PL composition give a new insight about the response inflicted by Ps. putida when these bacteria are exposed to QACs.
