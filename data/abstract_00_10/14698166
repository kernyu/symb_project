A series of 7-(substituted)aminomethyl quinolones was synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. Derivatives with (monoalkyl)aminomethyl substituent at C-7 displayed high in vitro activities comparable to Lomefloxacin against gram-negative organisms, whereas those bearing a [(substituted)phenyl]aminomethyl side chain at C-7 demonstrated good activities against gram-positive organisms as potent as Lomefloxacin and Vancomycin.
