Two genes, md1 and md2, coding for multidrug resistance ATP-binding cassette transporters were identified in Mycoplasma hominis PG21. Expression of these two genes, quantified by quantitative competitive reverse transcription-PCR, was significantly increased in ethidium bromide-resistant strains of M. hominis compared to that in M. hominis PG21.
