We developed two colorimetric methods for the detection of vancomycin- and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in </=6 h: (i) a nitrate reductase assay and (ii) a resazurin microplate method. MICs agreed with results obtained by CLSI methods for oxacillin. However, detection of vancomycin resistance required a larger inoculum. These methods may be recommended for the detection of vancomycin- and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus.
