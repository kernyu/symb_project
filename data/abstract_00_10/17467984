A series of oxadiazole mannich bases were synthesized by reacting oxadiazole derivatives, dapsone and appropriate aldehyde in the presence of methanol. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for antimycobacterial activity against M. tuberculosis H(37)Rv and INH resistant M. tuberculosis. Among the synthesized compounds, compound (4) 3-{2-furyl[4-(4-{2-furyl[5-(2-naphthyloxymethyl)-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1,3,4-oxadi azol-3-yl]methylamino}phenylsulfonyl)anilino]methyl}-5-(2-naphthyloxymethyl)-2,3- dihydro-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thione was found to be the most promising compound active against M. tuberculosis H(37)Rv and isoniazid (INH) resistant M. tuberculosis with Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 0.1 microM & 1.10 microM respectively.
