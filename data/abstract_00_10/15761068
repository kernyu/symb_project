OBJECTIVES: To measure the effect of opsonophagocytosis mediated by complement activated by specific antibodies on the co-amoxiclav serum bactericidal activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae strains with reduced susceptibility to beta-lactams (amoxicillin MICs of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg/L). METHODS: An open Phase I study measuring ex vivo bactericidal activity after anti-pneumococcal vaccination and an oral dose of 2000/125 mg sustained-release co-amoxiclav was carried out. The ex vivo bactericidal activity was investigated through killing curves over 3 h [assuring polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) viability] with serum samples collected 1.5 h and 5 h after dosing. Global killing was measured as the area under the killing curve (AUKC; log cfu x h/mL). The AUKC of the control growth curve of S. pneumoniae in Hanks' balanced salt solution (AUKC(K)) was used as control. The effect of the presence of complement and/or PMN was evaluated by the difference in the AUKC(K) and the different AUKCs obtained in the presence of inactivated serum (AUKC(IS)), active serum (AUKC(S)), inactivated serum plus PMN (AUKC(IS+PMN)) and active serum plus PMN (AUKC(S+PMN)). RESULTS: Significant differences were found in all cases between the bactericidal activity of active serum+PMN (AUKC(K) - AUKC(S+PMN)) and that of inactivated serum (AUKC(K) - AUKC(IS)) with therapeutic indexes ranging from 0.56 to 3.04. At 1.5 h after dosing, a significantly higher bactericidal activity of co-amoxiclav was obtained when opsonophagocytosis occurred (samples with active serum and PMN) than when not occurring (killing curves with inactivated serum and without PMN), for all amoxicillin non-susceptible strains. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this ex vivo study suggest that the collaboration of co-amoxiclav and complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis activated by specific antibodies may lay new approaches to overcome in vivo amoxicillin non-susceptibility.
