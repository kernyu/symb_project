Recent advances in knowledge of the properties of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are reviewed. AMPs are typically small, positively charged, amphipathic peptides that interact electrostatically and non-stereospecifically with the bacterial cell membrane, resulting in its permeabilization and cell death. Classes of AMPs, their mechanisms of action, hemolytic activity, and cytotoxicity towards host cells are discussed. A particular focus is AMPs with potential for use in defense against biological warfare agents. Some AMPs cytotoxic to Bacillus anthracis have been described. Synthesis of these peptides in multivalent form leads to a synergistic increase in antibacterial activity. Strategies to enhance the potency, stability, and selectivity of AMPs are discussed.
