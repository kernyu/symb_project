TiO(2)/Ag nano-antibacterial material was prepared at low temperature using polyethylene glycol (PEG-600) as reducing and stabilizing agent. The size and shape as well as the optical properties of the nano-materials were characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-vis spectroscopy (UV-vis). The results showed that the average particle size of TiO(2) among these nano-materials was around 50-150 nm, and the average particle size of nano-silver was around 20 nm. Formation of Ag nano-particles on the surface of TiO(2) was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the antibacterial activity was also investigated. By the antibacterial activity study and ultraviolet resistance test, it is noted that growth inhibition rates against E. coli was 99.99% as the concentration of nano-particles dispersion solution was 10 ppm, the minimum UV protective effect could be achieved as the concentration was 290 ppm.
