Data from retrospective and prospective studies support use of genotypic and phenotypic resistance assays to guide treatment changes when initial or subsequent antiretroviral regimens fail. Several retrospective studies have shown that response to antiretroviral therapy can be predicted based on genotypic analysis of HIV, with baseline genotypic evidence of resistance predicting virologic failure. Other retrospective analyses demonstrated that phenotypic drug sensitivity correlates with increased viral load suppression, particularly when virus remains sensitive to two or three drugs at initiation of the regimen. Furthermore, prospective studies such as VIRADAPT and Genotype-Assisted Antiretroviral Resistance Testing (GART) have substantiated that drug selection based on genotypic assay results yield superior viral suppression compared with empiric treatment assignment. One additional study suggested significant improvement in short-term virologic outcome when phenotypic testing was used to guide treatment selection. Based on these findings, resistance testing is currently recommended for patients with acute HIV infection, those who have failed one or more antiretroviral regimens, and pregnant women. Although these tests move toward becoming a standard of care, several research questions remain: the long-term benefit of resistance testing is not yet certain, the interpretation of specific genotypic resistance patterns needs to be better defined, and clinical cut-off points for phenotypic resistance need to be established. As these issues continue to be studied, resistance testing likely will prove a reliable tool to help plan successful ART strategies.
