The presence of erm genes was investigated among macrolide-resistant Gram-positive bacteria isolated from soil samples collected from four Danish farms that had been treated with animal waste. Soil samples were collected before, a few days after spread and 1 1/2 months and 5 months later. In 33% (9/27) of these isolates, an erm gene was detected using PCR. Eight isolates were positive for erm(B) and one isolate was positive for erm(C). No isolates contained erm(A), erm(D) or erm(F). The positive isolates were identified to genus level. Two erm(B) positive isolates were identified as Enterococcus spp., and the erm(C)-positive isolate as a Streptococcus spp., probably indicating survival from animal waste. The remaining six erm(B) positive isolates all belonged to the Bacillus cereus group. The erm(B) gene has not previously been identified in B. cereus but is frequently found among enterococci. This result could indicate horizontal transfer from bacteria of animal origin to indigenous soil bacteria.
