Spoligotyping was undertaken in 65 multiple-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Bombay, India. The spoligotype patterns showed seven closely related clusters, a cluster with 2 Beijing-like isolates, and unique spoligotypes (43%). Of the clusters, one with 29% of all the isolates suggested transmission of a dominant resistant clone.
