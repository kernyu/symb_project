A 50-year-old man had uneventful bilateral laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for moderate myopia (-4.50 diopters sphere, both eyes). Twelve days postoperatively, he developed unilateral bacterial keratitis. Cultures revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The antibiotic regimen was adjusted, and he regained an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 and a best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) of 20/15. Bacterial keratitis after LASIK is a rare occurrence. Aggressive use of cultures and fortified antibiotics can prevent significant loss of BSCVA, even when a resistant organism is the cause.
