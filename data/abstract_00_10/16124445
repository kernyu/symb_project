Abstract. A 17-year-old man who presented with progressive quadriparesis is reported. About 8 months prior to admission, he had miliary tuberculosis, and that improved with anti-tuberculous therapy. He had also developed tuberculous meningitis and tuberculous myelitis, respectively. He regularly took anti-tuberculous drugs until this illness. Neurological findings were compatible with cervical cord lesion. CSF analysis indicated a predominate lymphocytic pleocytosis with a high protein level and low sugar profile. MRI findings revealed a multi-loculated arachnoid cyst at C1-C3 level with pressure affecting the adjacent spinal cord and evidence of myelitis at C3-T1 level. Hemi-larminectomy and removal of the arachnoid cyst were performed, but without improvement. A CSF culture yielded M. tuberculosis, that was susceptible to anti-tuberculous drugs.
