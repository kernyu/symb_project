The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens is escalating worldwide. Outbreaks of community- and hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are being reported more frequently. Although antimicrobial resistance is well recognised as a global problem, decisions about appropriate intervention and treatment should be made at the level of the local hospital or healthcare system. Thus, local surveillance to identify prevalent pathogens, detect bacterial resistance and identify particular strains is necessary for selecting optimal treatment regimens. In addition, bactericidal antimicrobial agents with novel mechanisms of action and activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria, together with improved infection control measures, are needed to address this growing medical problem more effectively.
