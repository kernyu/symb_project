1. Therapeutic decisions are guided by a patient's clinical status (severity of disease and presence of comorbidities) and previous drug-exposure history. 2. Lamivudine is safe and effective in liver transplant recipients with recurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection caused by wild-type virus or failure of hepatitis B immunoglobulin therapy. Lamivudine resistance, developing in approximately 25% after 12 months of therapy, is its main limitation. 3. Famciclovir is safe in liver transplant recipients; however, virological and clinical responses are less consistent than with lamivudine. Thus, lamivudine is favored over famciclovir as first-line therapy in transplant recipients with no previous exposure to nucleoside analogues. 4. Although limited in availability, adefovir dipivoxil appears safe and effective in treating liver transplant recipients with lamivudine-resistant HBV disease. Close monitoring of renal function is recommended, with dose adjustment in patients with reduced creatinine clearances. 5. Limited data suggest that intravenous ganciclovir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and interferon alfa may be useful as rescue therapies for patients with lamivudine- or famciclovir-resistant HBV disease. 6. Antiviral therapy with two or more suitable agents may minimize the chance for viral resistance; therefore, future therapeutic strategies likely will use combination therapy in the long-term management of recurrent HBV disease.
