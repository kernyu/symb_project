Studies of the use of antiseptics for the treatment of diseases of the ear, nose and throat are rather rare in literature. Many of the until recently common drugs are now assessed as obsolete or dispensable. The local application of systemic antibiotics has to be rejected because of the microbial development of antibiotic resistance. Here is where antiseptics prove to have maintained their importance. On the basis of the present literature, an overview is given of the antiseptics that are presently recommended for use in ENT practice and their use in the area of the oral cavity, the nose, the ear and in wounds.
