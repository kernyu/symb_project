A novel series of quinolones was discovered as HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) using a structure-based approach. The lead quinolones exhibited single digit nanomolar potency in the HIV-1 replication assays. The preliminary SAR of these quinolones was also established via systematic structural modifications. These novel and potent quinolones could serve as advanced leads for further optimization.
