OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlation between non-hospital antimicrobial consumption and resistance. METHODS: Information on the non-hospital sales of antimicrobials from 14 European countries in 1997 and 2000 was compared with the antimicrobial resistance profiles of Escherichia coli isolated from women with community-acquired urinary tract infection in the same countries in 1999/2000. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant correlation between the consumption of and resistance to co-amoxiclav, cefadroxil, fosfomycin, mecillinam, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. On the other hand, there were statistically significant correlations between consumption of broad-spectrum penicillins and quinolones in 1997 and 2000 and resistance to ciprofloxacin (P range 0.0005-0.0045) and nalidixic acid (P range 0.0013-0.0049). Total antimicrobial consumption in 1997 was significantly correlated to ciprofloxacin (P=0.0009) and nalidixic acid (P=0.0018) resistance, and there were significant relationships between quinolone consumption in both years and resistance to gentamicin (P range 0.0029-0.0043) and nitrofurantoin (P range 0.0003-0.0007). E. coli with multiple antimicrobial resistance were significantly more common in countries with high total antimicrobial consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the frequent presence of many possible confounding factors, antimicrobial resistance to one drug does not always correlate well to the consumption of the same drug or closely related drugs. This study showed that the degree of antimicrobial consumption was significantly correlated to the incidence of multidrug-resistant E. coli.
