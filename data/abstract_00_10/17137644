There is a limited information with regard to the neuraminidase (NA) mutations conferring resistance to peramivir and zanamivir in the influenza N1 background. In this study, an influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) recombinant virus was passaged under peramivir or zanamivir pressure. The peramivir-selected variant had a H274Y mutation in the neuraminidase (NA) gene conferring resistance to peramivir and oseltamivir but susceptibility to zanamivir. The zanamivir-selected variant had a massive deletion in the region encoding the NA active center and an A200T hemagglutinin mutation. This variant exhibited reduced susceptibility to zanamivir with a drug-dependent phenotype.
