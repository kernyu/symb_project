Chronic bacterial prostatitis is the most frequent cause for recurrent urinary tract infection in young and middle-aged men. The selection of an appropriate antimicrobial agent that has optimal pharmacokinetics for urine and prostatic secretion and tissue is important in both entities. Fluoroquinolones possess several pharmacologic characteristics that favor them for treatment of urinary tract infection and prostatitis. The pharmacokinetics of fluoroquinolones and the theoretical background of drug penetration into the prostate are outlined. Analyzing the concentrations of various fluoroquinolones in urine, prostatic and seminal fluid, and in prostatic tissue, it becomes obvious that the fluoroquinolones differ in plasma concentrations and in their concentrations at these sites. Nevertheless, overall, the concentrations at the site of infection of most of the fluoroquinolones should be sufficient for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis and vesiculitis and recurrent urinary tract infection in men caused by susceptible pathogens.
