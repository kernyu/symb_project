Our study compared the susceptibility of 136 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and 119 multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from Oslo to a range of antibiotics, including the novel antibiotics quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid and daptomycin. All isolates were susceptible to daptomycin, linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin, although a subgroup was less susceptible to the latter. There was no linkage between reduced susceptibility to daptomycin, linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin and resistance to other classes of antimicrobials. In addition, MRSA strains from 2004 have become more sensitive to fucidin and rifampicin. The results can be used to evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints and to define a baseline for monitoring possible future emergence of resistance to daptomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in Staphylococcus aureus in Norway.
