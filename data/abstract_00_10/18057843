A total of 153 isolates of Salmonella Typhimurium derived from food-producing animals in Japan between 2002 and 2005 were investigated for antimicrobial resistance and phage types related to definitive phage type 104 (DT104). The predominant resistance type was resistance to ampicillin, dihydrostreptomycin, kanamycin, and oxytetracycline in bovine (45.2%, 48/104) and resistance to dihydrostreptomycin and oxytetracycline in porcine isolates (58.7%, 27/48). DT104-related phage type was found in 32 of 104 bovine isolates, two of 48 porcine isolates, and one of eight isolates from poultry, showing that the proportion of the phage type in S. Typhimurium isolates from cattle and pigs significantly (P<0.01) decreased from 71.9% and 31.4% in 1999-2001 to 30.8% and 4.1% in 2002-2005, respectively.
