ASHP supports the identification and treatment of H. pylori infection in appropriate patients as an effective method of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with peptic ulcer disease. Successful and safe therapy requires extensive patient education and monitoring by qualified health care professionals to maximize patient understanding of and compliance with medication regimens and to minimize adverse events. Pharmacists are key to ensuring that patients use prescribed regimens appropriately so that H. pylori is eradicated and that clinical outcomes of associated peptic ulcer disease are optimal.
