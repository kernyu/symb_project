A highly N-phosphonomethylglycine (glyphosate)-resistant Pseudomonas fluorescens G2 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) was mapped to identify potential split sites using a transposon-based linker-scanning procedure. Intein-mediated protein complementation was used to reconstitute glyphosate resistance from the genetically divided G2 EPSPS gene in Escherichia coli strain ER2799 and transgenic tobacco.
