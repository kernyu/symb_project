Inoculation at weaning with Trypanosoma cruzi in inbred "l" rats resulted in a self-resolving acute infection characterized by marked parasitaemias, whereas challenge to adult rats revealed a mild disease with extremely low parasitaemias. To explore the mechanisms underlying such age-associated differences in disease outcome, we analysed the in vitro replication of T. cruzi, nitric oxide and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production in peritoneal macrophages (PMs), the serum concentrations of the specific immunoglobulins (Igs) IgM and IgG, antibodies exhibiting lytic activity against bloodstream forms of T. cruzi and circulating levels of nitrate, TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Macrophages from young rats were as effective as their adult counterparts for restraining intracellular parasite replication. When stimulated with IFN-gamma, culture supernatants from young PMs contained higher amounts of nitrite and TNF-alpha. Serum samples from 4 and 7 days post infection revealed easily detectable amounts of nitrate, with values being further augmented by day 7 post infection and significantly higher in the young group. TNF-alpha levels were only detected in the young group by day 7 post infection. Both groups had increased amounts of IFN-gamma in their sera, although in adult rats, this trend was followed by a significant drop at day 7, with young rats showing values still higher by the same time point evaluation. In contrast, young rats presented significantly lower levels of IgM and IgG antibodies during the first week of infection. Increased resistance in adult rats seems to be the result of a more appropriate antibody production.
