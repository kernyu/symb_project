Resistance to antiparasitic drugs is all too common in parasites of veterinary interest. The fact that resistance has arisen in so many different species of parasite and hosts against so many different drugs and in so many geographic areas suggests that the resistances may have common features. Such features may be useful in generating ideas for resistance management. Although describing the nature and presence of resistance remains an important objective, there is now a pressing need to develop improved methods of detection of resistance and to devise schemes for integrated parasite management (IPM). Multidisciplinary teams of researchers and extension workers are exploring new ways to deal with the problem of resistance.
