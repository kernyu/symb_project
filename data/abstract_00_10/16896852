OBJECTIVE: To assess the distribution of bacterial species and antimicrobial resistance in an ICU during long-term use of selective digestive decontamination (SDD) in the context of national reference data. DESIGN AND SETTING: Five-year prospective observational study in a 24-bed interdisciplinary surgical ICU of a university hospital (study ICU) participating in the project "Surveillance of Antimicrobial Use and Antimicrobial Resistance in German Intensive Care Units" (SARI; reference ICUs). PATIENTS: Resistance data were obtained from all patients; patients intubated for at least 2 days received SDD (colistin, tobramycin, amphotericin B). INTERVENTIONS AND MEASUREMENTS: SDD was performed in 1,913 of 7,270 patients. Antimicrobial resistance was examined in 4,597 (study ICU) and 46,346 (reference ICUs) isolates. RESULTS: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remained stable (2.76 and 2.58 isolates/1000 patient days) in the study ICU; this was below the German average (4.26 isolates/1000 patient days). Aminoglycoside- and betalactam-resistant Gram-negative rods did not increase during SDD use. Aminoglycoside resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 50% below the mean value of SARI (0.24 vs. 0.52 isolates/1,000 patient days). The relative frequency of enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) was higher than in the SARI ICUs (23.2% vs. 17.3%, and 25.0% vs. 20.6%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Routine 5-year-use of SDD was not associated with increased antimicrobial resistance in our ICU with low baseline resistance rates. Vigorous surveillance and control measures to search and destroy MRSA were considered a mandatory component of the SDD program. The relative increase in enterococci and CNS is of concern requiring further investigation.
