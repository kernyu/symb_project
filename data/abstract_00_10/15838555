To transform grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) with a visual reporter gene (gfp) and a target gene (tlp), three genotypes (two inbreds, Tx 430 and C401, and a commercial hybrid, Pioneer 8505) were used. We obtained a total of 1011 fertile transgenic plants from 61 independent callus lines, which were produced from 2463 zygotic immature embryos via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The reporter gene, gfp, encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP), was used as a visual screening marker, and the target gene, tlp, encoding thaumatin-like protein (TLP), was chosen for enhancing resistance to fungal diseases and drought. Both genes were under the control of the maize ubi 1 promoter in the binary vector pPZP201. A total of 320 plants showing GFP expression, derived from 45 calli, were selected and analyzed by Southern blot analysis. There was a 100% correlation between the GFP expression and the presence of the target gene, tlp, in these plants. Transgenic plants showing strong TLP expression were confirmed by Western blotting with antiserum specific for TLP. The transgene segregated in various ratios among progeny, which was confirmed by examining seedlings showing GFP fluorescence. The progeny also showed different copy numbers of transgenics. This report describes the successful use of GFP screening for efficient production of stably transformed sorghum plants without using antibiotics or herbicides as selection agents.
