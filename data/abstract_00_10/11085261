Although previously reported attempts to construct recA null mutants in Streptomyces spp. have been unsuccessful, we have used the suicide plasmid pErmdeltaRecA to inactivate the recA gene in Streptomyces rimosus by gene disruption. pErmdeltaRecA carries the erythromycin resistance gene ermE and a 451-bp fragment of the S. rimosus recA gene (encoding amino acids 2-151). An erythromycin-resistant clone with single plasmid integration into the recA gene on the chromosome was analyzed in detail. This clone possesses one inactive copy of recA which lacks the entire promoter region and the ATG start codon, and a second, truncated gene that encodes only first 151 amino acids of the RecA protein. This S. rimiosus rec A mutant can therefore be considered a completely RecA-deficient strain. The mutant strain is highly sensitive to UV light. Introduction of a plasmid carrying the wild type S. rimosus recA gene completely restored the UV resistance of the recA mutant to wild-type levels. recA genes encoding RecA proteins with short deletions at the C-terminus (21 and 51 amino acids) could not fully rescue the UV sensitivity of the S. rimosus recA strain, when introduced in the same way.
