OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation between genotype drug resistance and CD(4)(+) T-lymphocyte of AIDS patients who received antiretroviral treatment in Henan province. METHODS: Several indicators were studied through questionnaires and whole blood was collected to analyze CD4+ T-lymphocyte as well as the virus load. In-House technique was used to detect the genotype drug resistance. RESULTS: 32.21% and 29.17% of the patients were identified as genotype drug resistant to AIDS when used first and second generation medicine schemes but the improvement (P = 0.7538) of disease process was not influenced much. However, if the genotype drug resistance of patients with HAART last longer than two years (33.20%) or patients with HAART less than one year (18.97%), a greater impact on the improvement was noticed. Age (OR = 0.68) and the interval on distribution of medicines (OR = 1.93) had a great impact on the improvement with the genotype drug resistance through logistic regression analysis. Medicine scheme (OR = 0.51), genotype drug resistance (OR = 3.20) and the rate of regular dose in a month (OR = 0.51) all had a great impact on the improvement to CD4+ T-lymphocyte by logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Part of HIV/AIDS patients showed resistant to genotype drugs in Henan province, suggesting that we must reinforce the surveillance on HAART and program on drug administration to the patients, in order to increase the number of CD4+ T-lymphocyte so as to avoid the development of drug resistance.
