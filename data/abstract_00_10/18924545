Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in dermatology practice for a variety of disorders, including acne vulgaris and rosacea. Importantly, they often are used long-term for these inflammatory dermatoses. Changes in bacterial ecology related to antibiotic prescribing have led to the decreased sensitivity of some bacterial organisms, such as Propionibacterium acnes, to antibiotics commonly prescribed by dermatologists. The potential clinical outcomes of altered bacterial sensitivities may vary among specific disease states and include decreased therapeutic response and the need to alter approaches in disease management. Additionally, changing patterns of antibiotic sensitivity and the emergence of more virulent pathogens, such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, macrolide-resistant staphylococci and streptococci, and mupirocin-resistant S aureus, have led to marked changes in how clinicians use antibiotics in clinical practice. This article reviews antibiotic prescribing in dermatology practice and provides important clinical perspectives and recommendations to preserve the therapeutic value of antibiotics based on a thorough review of current literature and clinical experience.
