A nosocomial outbreak of epidemiologically related VEB-1 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii occurred in 33 patients in an intensive care unit. A case-control study identified previous treatment with third-generation cephalosporins as the only risk factor for A. baumannii acquisition. Rationale for antibiotic use should be strengthened.
