BACKGROUND: Docetaxel and gemcitabine are active against chemotherapy-pretreated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose of this phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of monthly docetaxel combined with weekly gemcitabine in NSCLC patients failing one prior regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients were enrolled. Prior chemotherapy was a platinum-based combination in 36 patients, using vinorelbine in 26 patients and etoposide in 10 patients. The other four patients had prior single agents. Tumors were refractory or resistant to front-line therapy in 80% of patients. Treatment was gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 days 1, 8, 15 and docetaxel 100 mg/m2 day 1, with cycles repeated every four weeks. RESULTS: Thirteen patients responded (32.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 19%-49%), including one complete and 12 partial responses. Responses were observed at all metastatic sites, with similar response frequencies in platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant/refractory tumors. The median time to progression for responders was nine months, with two responses lasting longer than a year. Median survival was 8.1 months. Hematologic toxicities included grade 4 neutropenia in 23 patients, with 4 episodes of febrile neutropenia, grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia in 9 patients, and anemia requiring red cell transfusions in 9 patients. With the exception of asthenia, severe non-hematologic toxicities were infrequent. CONCLUSIONS: Monthly docetaxel, combined with weekly gemcitabine, is an active and safe second-line therapy for NSCLC patients.
