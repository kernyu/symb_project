OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and laboratory properties, to see the response to therapy, incidence of antimicrobial resistance and complications of Enteric Fever in children. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 82 cases of enteric fever admitted in department of pediatrics, Manipal Teaching hospital, Pokhara, Nepal. Study period was six years from (Jan 2000 to Dec 2005). RESULTS: Total of 82 cases of Salmonella infections were admitted .There were 50 (60%) males and 32 (40%) females. Most of the patients were above the age of five. The leading clinical feature were Fever (100%) , GI symptoms (73%), followed by splenomegaly (60%), hepatomegaly (58%), chills & rigor (41%), headache(33%),coated tongue(17%), lymphadenopathy (13%), Respiratory signs (13%), toxic look (7%). The laboratory reports revealed leucopenia in 26% and leukocytosis in 16%. Widal test was positive in 83%, Blood culture was positive in 37 %.Bone marrow was done in 8 cases, out of which 5(62.5%) were culture positive. Out of 35 culture positive cases 32 were Salmonella typhi and 3 were Salmonella paratyphi A. Regarding the treatment 55% were treated with ciprofloxacin, 29 % with ceftriaxone, 7% with ampicillin, 6% with cefotaxime and 2.4 % with chloramphenicol. Response to therapy was assessed by day of defervescence after antibiotics. Best response was observed with ciprofloxacin (4.7 days) followed by ceftriaxone (5 days), ampicillin (5.5 days), cefotaximee (6.4 days), chloramphenicol (10 days) respectively. In the antibiogram resistance was 43% with chloramphenicol, 37% with ampicillin, 31% with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, 5.7%with ciprofloxacin and 4% with cefotaxime. Resistance was 0% with ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, and ofloxacin. Gentamycin was found to show high sensitivity (91%). The complications observed were anemia in 10%, 5% had neurologic signs like clouding of consciousness and 3.7% had CNS irritability. CONCLUSION: It is important to include Enteric fever in the differential diagnosis of febrile patients with abdominal symptoms. Though blood culture is the definite test, Widal test plays supportive role in diagnosis of enteric fever, especially when patients come after a course of antibiotics. Sometimes when both blood culture and Widal tests are negative Bone marrow can be the diagnostic tool for the diagnosis. Based on this analysis ciprofloxacin is still a good drug for the treatment of Enteric Fever. Ceftriaxone, Cefuroxime and Ofloxacin can be considered as first line treatment for Enteric fever since resistance was nil with these drugs on culture reports.
