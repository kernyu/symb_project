A rare case of pulmonary Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (N. otitidiscaviarum) was encountered in an immunocompetent host. A 74-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a high fever and a productive cough. His chest radiograph and CT scan revealed infiltrative shadows in the right middle and lower lung fields. Although several antibiotics (third-generation cephalosporin, minocycline, imipenem) were administered, the fever and cough persisted, and C-reactive protein remained elevated. Repeated sputum cultures showed normal flora, so a transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed bronchoscopically at the right S5. The BAL fluid contained acid-fast, branching filamentous structures. The microorganism was identified as N. otitidiscaviarum by the Research Center for Pathogenic Fungi and Microbial Toxicoses (Chiba University). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was therefore administered, but the fever continued to rise daily, and C-reactive protein remained elevated. This isolated N. otitidiscaviarum showed resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents in vitro when examined by the disk diffusion method, and so, on the basis of the antibiogram, the patient was treated with clarithromycin (oral, 600 mg/day) plus amikacin (400 mg/day), which proved successful. Testing for pulmonary nocardiosis should be added to the differential diagnosis procedures for refractory pneumonia as an opportunistic infection and for community-acquired pneumonia.
