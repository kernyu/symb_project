The full-length nucleotide sequence of alpha-tubulin gene from each of 6 Fusarium graminearum strains from China which had different carbendazim (MBC) sensitivity phenotypes were separated using PCR with 4 primer sets designed in accordance with nucleotide sequence of the gene from the reference isolate, NRRL 31084 (PH-1). The DNA sequence comparison showed that there was no difference in the nucleotide sequence of alpha-tubulin gene amongst 3 sensitive and 3 resistant strains from China. This result demonstrates that there is no relationship between MBC-resistance and alpha-tubulin gene. The full-length of the gene spans 1718 bp, including 6 introns, encoding 449 amino acids. With 99% homology, there is 5 nucleotide differences in alpha-tubulin gene between PH-1 isolate and the 6 strains from China. The homology of the deduced amino acid sequence of the gene is 99.78% between the 6 strains and PH-1 isolate, and 37%-86% between the 6 strains and other 6 species of fungi.
