The Th1 response elicited in mice infected with Leishmania major has been used as a model to characterize cellular immune defects associated with L. amazonensis infection. However, it is not known if the immune response associated with the infection by virulent L. major parasites can promote resistance to a subsequent L. amazonensis infection. Our data demonstrate that C3HeB/FeJ mice infected subcutaneously with virulent L. major are resistant to an L. amazonensis challenge. The healing phenotype is characterized by a Th1 response as measured by increased production of interferon-gamma and low levels of interleukin-4 in the draining lymph node. Together, this indicates that the Th1 response associated with L. major infection can promote resistance to L. amazonensis infection and that it can be used as a tool to study the immune defects associated with L. amazonensis infection.
