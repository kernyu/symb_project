Bacterial isolates from poultry products were tested for their susceptibility to 10 antibiotics commonly used in the therapeutic treatment of poultry. Bacteria were isolated from fresh whole broiler carcasses or from cut-up meat samples (breast with or without skin, wings, and thighs) that were either fresh or stored at 4 or 13 degrees C (temperatures relevant to poultry-processing facilities). The Biolog system was used to identify isolates, and a broth dilution method was used to determine the antibiotic resistance properties of both these isolates and complementary cultures from the American Type Culture Collection. The antibiotics to which the most resistance was noted were penicillin G, sulfadimethoxine, and erythromycin; the antibiotic to which the least resistance was noted was enrofloxacin. Individual isolates exhibited resistances to as many as six antibiotics, with the most common resistance pattern involving the resistance of gram-negative bacteria to penicillin G, sulfadimethoxine, and erythromycin. Differences in resistance patterns were noted among 18 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative bacteria, and comparisons were made between species within the same genus. The data obtained in this study provide a useful reference for the species and resistance properties of bacteria found on various raw poultry products, either fresh or stored at temperatures and for times relevant to commercial processing, storage, and distribution. The results of this study show that resistance to antibiotics used for the therapeutic treatment of poultry occurs in bacteria in the processing environment.
