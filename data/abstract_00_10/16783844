The use of antibiotic prophylaxis in neutropenic patients remains controversial. The main arguments against prophylaxis are the lack of survival benefit and the risk of inducing antibiotic resistance. At present, clinical guidelines advise against routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis and current practice is to commence broad-spectrum antibiotics at the onset of fever in the neutropenic patient. However hospitalization, investigations and treatment all impact on resources as well as affecting patient quality of life, often resulting in chemotherapy delays and dose reductions. The benefits of prophylactic antibiotics have been emphasized by two major double-blind, placebo controlled trials with levofloxacin with very significant reductions in all infection-related events. Furthermore, the meta-analysis confirms a survival advantage and this is greatest with the use of fluoroquinolones. These benefits must be weighed against the problem of emerging antibiotic resistance. It has been shown that antibiotic prophylaxis does induce resistant organisms, but some studies have shown that the impact on clinical outcomes may not be as great as expected. Current evidence supports antibiotic prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones in acute leukaemia and high-dose chemotherapy patients, commencing at the same time as chemotherapy. Febrile episodes are much commoner with the first cycle in patients with solid tumours or lymphoma having moderately myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and these patients should be offered prophylaxis for at least the first cycle of chemotherapy. Further work is ongoing to facilitate the selection of patients with the greatest chance of benefit so that prophylaxis can be used efficiently.
