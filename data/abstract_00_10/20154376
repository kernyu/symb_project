More than 90% of Staphylococcus strains are resistant to penicillin. In 1961 S. aureus developed resistance to methicillin (MRSA), invalidating almost all antibiotics, including the most potent beta-lactams. Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, was used for the treatment of MRSA in 1980. Vancomycin inhibits the bio-synthesis of peptidoglycan and the assembly of NAM-NAG-polypeptide into the growing peptidoglycan chain. Vancomycin resistant S. aureus (VRSA) first appeared in the USA in 2002. Folic acid tagged chitosan nanoparticles are used as Trojan horses to deliver vancomycin into bacterial cells. These nanoparticles are biocompatible and biodegradable semisynthetic polymers. These nanosized vehicles enhance the transport of vancomycin across epithelial surfaces and show its efficient drug action, which has been understood from studies of the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of nanoparticles of a chitosan derivative loaded with vancomycin. Tolerance values distinctly show that vancomycin loaded into nanoconjugate is very effective and has a strong bactericidal effect on VRSA.
