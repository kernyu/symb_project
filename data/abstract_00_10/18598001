Quantitative and qualitative composition of microflora of nasal mucosa as well as carriage of staphylococci was assessed in patients with chronic and acute forms of maxillary sinusitis. Changes in microflora of nasal mucosa and presence of pathogenic and persistence-associated characteristics of staphylococci in both forms of maxillary sinusitis were revealed. Increase of resistance staphylococci to antibiotics in patients with chronic form of maxillary sinusitis was shown.
