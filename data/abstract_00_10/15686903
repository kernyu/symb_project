A simple two-step synthesis method was used to make 51 B-ring-substituted 4-hydroxyquinolines allowing analysis of the effect of ring substitutions on inhibition of growth of chloroquine sensitive and resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum, the dominant cause of malaria morbidity. Substituted quinoline rings other than the 7-chloroquinoline ring found in chloroquine were found to have significant activity against the drug-resistant strain of P. falciparum W2.
