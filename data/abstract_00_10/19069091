Drug resistance in various organisms including cancer cells, bacteria and fungi is a serious issue for human disease therapy, including use of anticancer drugs, antibiotics and antifungals, respectively. Candida strains resistant to the azole class of antifungal drugs, have been isolated frequently from HIV patients following prophylaxis with azole drugs such as fluconazole. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the emergence of drug-resistant clinical isolates, despite the recent introduction of new, effective classes of antifungal drugs such as the azole voriconazole, and the candin micafungin. In this review we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to the azole and candin antifungal agents.
