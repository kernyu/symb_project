Capnocytophaga spp. are normal inhabitants of the oropharyngeal flora. They are also involved in periodontal diseases or animal bites, complicated by septicaemia with dissemination to a great variety of sites, both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. This review will focus on their pathogenesis, spectrum of clinical infections and susceptibility to disinfectants and antibiotics. The spread of beta-lactamase-producing strains limits the use of beta-lactams as first-line treatments, underlying the necessity to test the in vitro susceptibility of clinical strains. Many antimicrobial treatments have been used, despite an absence of randomised studies and guidelines regarding the duration of treatment according to infected sites. Imipenem/cilastatin, clindamycin or beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations are always effective and their use can be recommended in all infections.
