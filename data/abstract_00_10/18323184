A 78-year-old man underwent a left lower sleeve lobectomy and lymph node dissection for lung cancer. His postoperative course had been uneventful until postoperative day (POD) 3, but severe dyspnea occurred suddenly and the chest X-p showed infiltration shadow on POD 3. Streptococcus pneumonia antigen in the urine was elevated, suggesting pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumonia. The patient was treated with double dose of imipenem/cilastatin sodium and supported with a mechanical ventilator in an intensive care unit. Although the patient recovered from penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumonia, he was suffered from Klebsiella sepsis and expired on the POD 26.
