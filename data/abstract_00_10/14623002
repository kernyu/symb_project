Problems of low solubility, high serum protein binding, and lack of efficacy in vivo in first generation MexAB-OprM specific efflux pump inhibitors were addressed. Through the use of pharmacophore modelling, the key structural elements for pump inhibition were defined. Use of alternative scaffolds upon which the key elements were arrayed gave second generation leads with greatly improved physical properties and activity in the potentiation of antibacterial quinolones (levofloxacin and sitafloxacin) versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vivo.
