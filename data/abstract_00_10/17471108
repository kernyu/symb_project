Aspergillus infection of the petrous apex is a rare and devastating condition. To date, only two such cases have been reported, which resulted from direct extension of chronic Aspergillus otitis media. We present a case of petrous apex aspergillosis occurring years after surgical drainage of a petrous apex granuloma cyst. Because of the potential lethal nature of this condition, aggressive surgical therapy should be considered early in this illness and may provide the best chance for survival.
