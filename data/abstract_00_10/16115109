An unusual central venous catheter (CVC)-related infection caused by Candida membranaefaciens in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is described. Clinical signs and microbiological results observed in this case may support the hypothesis of an emerging CVC-related fungaemia, because of new azole-resistant yeast, successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B. To date C. membranaefaciens (the teleomorph of Pichia membranaefaciens) has traditionally been considered non-pathogenic and this report seems to be the first case of systemic fungal infection. We believe that another fungus can be added to the list of opportunistic strains.
