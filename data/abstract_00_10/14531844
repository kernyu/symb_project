The emergence of strains of the human pathogen Candida albicans with resistance to commonly used antibiotics has necessitated a search for new types of antifungal agents. Six peptides with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from the foothill yellow-legged frog Rana boylii. Brevinin-1BYa (FLPILASLAA10KFGPKLF CLV20TKKC) was particularly potent against C. albicans [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 3 microm] and also active against Escherichia coli (MIC = 17 microm) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 2 microm), but its therapeutic potential for systemic use is limited by its strong hemolytic activity (HC50 = 4 microm). The single amino acid substitution (Phe12 --> Leu) in brevinin-1BYb resulted in a fourfold lower potency against C. albicans and the additional amino acid substitutions (Lys11 --> Thr, Phe17 --> Leu and Val20 --> Ile) in brevinin-1BYc resulted in a ninefold decrease in activity. Two members of the ranatuerin-2 family and one member of the temporin family were also isolated from the secretions but showed relatively low potency against the three microorganisms tested.
