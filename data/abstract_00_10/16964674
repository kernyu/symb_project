Despite of significant progress in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C after introduction of combination therapy with pegylated form of interferon-a with ribavirin, still overall response rate in HCV genotype-1 infected has been modest. Several teams has been working on modification of therapeutic methods. Optimization of the results is realized by individualization of therapy taking under consideration some known virological and host features. The main trends are following: settlement of optimal period of treatment of infected with HCV genotype-1, applying interferon-induction therapy for non-responders and relapsers at the course of previous treatment, as well as prolongation of therapy-period, and ribavirin-dose increasing. Very important is also looking for optimal predictive-viral parameters in early course of disease.
