BACKGROUND: The current study is part of a larger study--Self-Medication with Antibiotics and Resistance Levels in Europe (SAR project)--coordinated by the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and run in 19 European countries and Israel. OBJECTIVES: To estimate self-medication with antibiotics by a population in northern Israel. METHODS: We sent by post a questionnaire on antibiotic usage to 2,615 adults, both Jewish and Arab, living in northern Israel. RESULTS: The overall response rate was low (17.9%), particularly among the Arab population (9.4% of respondents). Among the 467 respondents, 169 (36.2%) reported 215 antibiotic courses within the last year. Amoxicillin was the antibiotic most commonly used (32.7% of courses); 89.4% of antibiotics were obtained via a physician's prescription; 114 respondents (24.4%) stored leftover antibiotics at home, and 81 (18.7%) would consider self-medication with antibiotics without a medical consultation. CONCLUSIONS: Over-the-counter acquisition of antibiotics is rare in Israel. However, the storage of leftover antibiotics in the home constitutes an alternative potential source of self-medication that can have untoward consequences, not only for the individual patient but also for the general population since inappropriate antibiotic usage contributes to the increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance.
