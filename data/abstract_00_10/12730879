BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inducible heat shock proteins (hsps), particularly hsp25 and hsp72, are expressed by surface colonocytes and may have a role in protecting intestinal epithelial cells against injury. This study is aimed at determining if enteric bacteria and/or immune signals regulate their physiologic expression. METHODS: Intestinal hsp25, hsp72, and constitutive hsc73 expression were studied in immunodeficient RAG-1(-/-) mice and in normal mice. Mucosal permeability was measured by mannitol flux and transepithelial resistance. Hsp expression in intestinal YAMC cells was assessed after incubation with recombinant cytokines, activated lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs), or Bacteroides fragilis. RESULTS: Chronic metronidazole treatment decreases colonic mucosal hsp25 and hsp72 expression, an effect associated with increased susceptibility of mucosal barrier function to C. difficile toxin A. Hsp expression also was increased in YAMC cells incubated with B. fragilis, an effect mediated by lipopolysaccharide and other bacteria-derived factors. Colonic hsp72, but not hsp25 or hsc73, expression is decreased in RAG-1(-/-) mice. Recombinant IL-2 and other cytokines enhance YAMC hsp25 and/or hsp72 expression. Activated LPLs induce YAMC hsp expression, an effect blocked by IL-2 neutralizing antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Enteric flora and mucosal lymphocytes play a role in maintaining physiologic expression of colonocyte hsp25 and hsp72.
