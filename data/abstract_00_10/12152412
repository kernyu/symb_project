Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a newly recognised coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, pathogenic for humans. Following patients' records over a 25 month period, we revealed 25 cultures positive for S. lugdunensis. Most of the samples were from infected wounds or abscesses in patients suffering from angiopathies of lower limbs, late complications of diabetes. SL was also isolated from a chronic breast abscess and ascites in another patient with liver cirrhosis. In five cases we understood the isolate as normal skin flora or colonising organism mostly in mixed culture. Resistance to penicillin was found in 6/25 isolates, and resistance to azithromycin, chloramphenicol and/or gentamicin was less common.
