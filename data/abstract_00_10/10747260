Nisin, a bacteriocin produced by some strains of Lactococcus lactis, acts against foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. A single exposure of cells to nisin can generate nisin-resistant (Nisr) mutants, which may compromise the use of nisin in the food industry. The objective of this research was to compare the heat resistance of Nisr and wild type (WT) Listeria monocytogenes. The synergistic effect of heat-treatment (55 degrees C) and nisin (500 IU ml-1) on the Nisr cells and the WT L. monocytogenes Scott A was also studied. When the cells were grown in the absence of nisin, there was no significant (alpha = 0.05) difference in heat resistance between WT and Nisr cells of L. monocytogenes at 55, 60 and 65 degrees C. However, when the Nisr cells were grown in the presence of nisin, they were more sensitive to heat at 55 degrees C than the WT cells. The D-values at 55 degrees C were 2.88 and 2.77 min for Nisr ATCC 700301 and ATCC 700302, respectively, which was significantly (alpha = 0.05) lower than the D-value for WT, 3.72 min. When Nisr cells were subjected to a combined treatment of heat and nisin, there was approximately a four log reduction during the first 7 min of treatment.
