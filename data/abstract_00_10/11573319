Samples of urine collected from patients with complicated urology infection and hospitalized to the Moscow Region Research Clinical Institute in 1986, 1991, 1995 and 1999 were analysed. Of 11,444 samples examined, bacteriuria was estimated in 7143 samples. 9786 strains (29 genus) of bacteria were isolated--56.9 per cent as mono culture and 43.1 per cent as associations. Susceptibility to 21 antibiotic was determined by disk diffusion method for 1607 strains; beta-lactamase production was determined in 198 strains, MIC was determined for 41 antibiotics. Gram-negative rods relative amount among pathogens decreased substantially (84.7 per cent in 1986 against 61.6 per cent in 1999), particularly Enterobacteriaceae (74.7 per cent in 1986 against 41.4 per cent in 1999). Nonfermenting Gram-negative rods (NFGNR) relative amount increased (10.8 per cent against 19.2 per cent), along with Gram-positive cocci (19.8 per cent against 64.2 per cent), particularly coagulasenegative staphylococci (CNS) (10.8 per cent against 35.9 per cent) and enterococci (5 per cent against 16.5 per cent) and candida and fungi (0.5 per cent in 1986 against 15.9 per cent in 1999). At the period 1986-1999 the main pathogens in urology infection were E. coli, Enterobacter spp., NFGNR (including P. aeruginosa), Staphylococcus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. The problem pathogens for urological department were the following: E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., NFGNR including P. aeruginosa, CNS, Enterococcus spp., candida and fungi. At the period 1991-1997 Gram-negative pathogens susceptibility to amikacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime was not changed in general, Gram-positive cocci (staphylococci and enterococci) retained the same susceptibility to vancomicin, cefamandol and amoxyclave. Staphylococci were also susceptible to amikacin, imipenem, rifampicin, oxacillin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin. Production of beta-lactamase was registered for 38.7 per cent of CNS, 26.5 per cent of E. coli, 38.5 per cent of K. pneumoniae, 25 per cent of P. mirabilis and 55.6 per cent of P. aeruginosa strains.
