It was shown that transgenic Tg8 mice with monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) gene knockout demonstrate higher resistance to acute ethanol exposure compared to wild type C3H mice. This difference was observed at the early age (28-30 days). Long-term ethanol treatment changed the resistance to hypnotic, but not hypothermic action of this agent. Seven-day exposure increased the resistance to ethanol-induced narcotic sleep in Tg8 and C3H mice. After 30-day ethanol treatment the duration of narcotic sleep sharply decreased in C3H mice and increased in Tg8 mice, which attested to their decreased tolerance to ethanol.
