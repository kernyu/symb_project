We report a retrospective study of 58 cases of empyema caused by Staphylococcus aureus at the Albert Royer Children's Hospital at the Fann University Hospital, between January 1st 1992 and December 31st 1995. Staphylococcus aureus is the principal bacterium responsible for pleural effusions in children (54%), way ahead of Streptococcus pneumoniae (19%). Most of the children affected (86%) are less than 30 months old. Theses infections are often serious due to the resistance of the bacterium to the usual antibiotics, the lack of solid research data and mechanical complications associated with the effusion. Treatment is based on the use of an appropriate bactericidal antibiotic treatment and pleural drainage.
