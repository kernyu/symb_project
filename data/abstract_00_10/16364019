To study the influences of chemical and physical factors on the protease resistant activity in vitro and the infectivity in vivo of scrapie strain 263K, PrPSc from the hamsters infected intracerebrally with scrapie strain 263K were treated with several commonly used disinfection methods, including sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), heating or autoclaving at 80, 100, 121 and 134 degrees C in the solutions with or without 3% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). The protease resistance of PrPSc was analysed by a proteinase K (PK) digesting Western blot and the infectivity of PrPSc was analysed by intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation into experimental hamsters. The results showed that PrPSc signals were removed in the preparations treated with NaOH higher than 0.05 mol/l, NaOCl higher than 0.1%, autoclaved over 121 degrees C, or heated over 80 degrees C in the presence of 3% SDS. Animal challenges revealed that mixing with 2 mol/l NaOH or 2% NaOCl, autoclaving at 134 degrees C, as well as heating at 100 degrees C or autoclaving at 121 degrees C in the solutions with 3% SDS completely blocks the transmission of scrapie 263K in this experimental situation. It is obvious that the removal of PK resistance of PrPSc happened at relatively lower concentration chemicals or lower temperature, while elimination of the infectivity needs more vigorous conditions. Our data provide the useful evidences for several commonly used methods to inactivate TSEs agent and suggest that it is inappropriate to use PrPSc as a surrogate for TSEs infectivity in inactivation experiments.
