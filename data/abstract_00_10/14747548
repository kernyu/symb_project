The viral protein Nef and the cellular factor cyclophilin A are both required for full infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions. In contrast, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) do not incorporate cyclophilin A into virions or need it for full infectivity. Since Nef and cyclophilin A appear to act in similar ways on postentry events, we determined whether chimeric HIV-1 virions that contained either HIV-2 or SIV Nef would have a direct effect on cyclophilin A dependence. Our results show that chimeric HIV-1 virions containing either HIV-2 or SIV Nef are resistant to treatment by cyclosporine and enhance the infectivity of virions with mutations in the cyclophilin A binding loop of Gag. Amino acids at the C terminus of HIV-2 and SIV are necessary for inducing cyclosporine resistance. However, transferring these amino acids to the C terminus of HIV-1 Nef is insufficient to induce cyclosporine resistance in HIV-1. These results suggest that HIV-2 and SIV Nef are able to compensate for the need for cyclophilin A for full infectivity and that amino acids present at the C termini of these proteins are important for this function.
