Fifty-four Enterococcus faecalis and 20 Enterococcus faecium isolates from clinical and non-human sources in Rome, Italy, were characterized by antibiotic resistance and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Resistance to vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, and ciprofloxacin was more frequent in E. faecium than in E. faecalis, whereas high-level resistance to aminoglycoside was found primarily in E. faecalis. Multi-resistance was found primarily among clinical isolates, but was also observed among environmental isolates. Common genotypes shared among clinical and environmental isolates were observed, however, the majority of isolates occurred as unique, source-specific clones. Several PFGE types were associated with shared features in their antibiotic resistance patterns; evidences of clonal spread between and within wards were also noted. This is the first report indicating clonal relatedness between human and environmental enterococci isolated in Italy.
