The ermB gene was identified in 111 erythromycin resistant isolates of Streptococcus uberis from cases of bovine mastitis associated either with a constitutive (47/111) or an inducible (64/111) phenotype, as well as a phenotypic resistance to all macrolides tested. Resistance to lincosamides was identified in 14 other isolates of S. uberis from bovine mastitis cases and was mainly mediated by the linB gene; resistance conferred by a combination of two genes (linB-lnuD, ermB-linB) was also detected.
