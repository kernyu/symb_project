The treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the critically ill patient is challenging. Data for treatment of critically ill patients are often lacking because many such patients are excluded from industry-sponsored prospective randomized clinical trials. Infections due to MRSA are common in the critical care setting. Up to 24% of patients in intensive care units are colonized with MRSA, and 20% of all nosocomial bloodstream infections are due to MRSA. It is also one of the leading bacterial causes of ventilator- and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Vancomycin has been the drug of choice for treatment of MRSA in the critical care setting. Recent data showing vancomycin resistance, increasing numbers of MRSA isolates with higher vancomycin minumum inhibitory concentrations, and an apparent increase in vancomycin clinical failures have brought vancomycin's utility into question. A variety of treatment options for MRSA are available. Quinupristin-dalfopristin was the first alternative to vancomycin. However, its safety profile and potential for drug interactions limit its use. Linezolid has been shown to be effective in the treatment of pneumonia and skin and skin-structure infections due to MRSA. The drug's potential to cause bone marrow suppression limits its use, especially in treatment durations extending beyond 14 days. Daptomycin has been shown to be effective for the treatment of MRSA bloodstream and of MRSA skin and skin-structure infections. Tigecycline is the newest available drug with MRSA activity. It has demonstrated noninferiority to vancomycin in skin and skin-structure infections. However, its role in the treatment of ventilator- and hospital-acquired pneumonia is still unclear.
