PURPOSE: Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has proven to be effective in treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Chronic administration of antiretrovirals presents significant challenges, including the risk of selecting treatment-resistant viral strains that can determine treatment failure and can be transmitted. In many countries, a large proportion of the HIV-infected population goes through the correctional system at least once. Scarce data are available on circulation of resistant HIV strains in correctional facilities. We evaluated the prevalence of antiretroviral resistance among both naive and treatment-experienced HIV-infected inmates of a correctional institution in Genoa, Italy. METHOD: The prevalence of antiretroviral resistance among the HIV-infected inmates observed at our institution who underwent genotypic testing from January 2004 to June 2007 was retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: 45 genotypes from 43 inmates were available. Most of the naive patients (14/16; 87.5%) showed a wild-type (WT) genotype, as well as most of the ART-experienced patients who had discontinued ART (10/13; 76.9%). A high proportion of WT genotype (6/16; 37.5%) was also observed among the subjects apparently failing HAART. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of mutated strains in treatment-naive individuals of the studied cohort is comparable to what is reported in nonimprisoned naive subjects of our region. The high prevalence of WT genotypes in ART-failing patients makes it likely that they were not taking their treatments, probably to gain legal benefits from their worsening health conditions. Thus, resistance testing can also be considered as an additional tool for assessing adherence to ART for forensic/medicolegal evaluation. However, further and larger studies are necessary to validate it.
