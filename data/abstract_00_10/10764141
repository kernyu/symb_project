Splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL) is a B cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorder. Splenectomy and/or chlorambucil are usually regarded as the most effective treatment in SLVL patients. However, a few patients relapse and the second-line treatment remains questionable. In a retrospective study, we evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of fludarabine (FDR) in 10 SLVL patients. The median duration between diagnosis and treatment was 17 months (range, 1-30). Two patients were previously untreated. The patients received FDR 25 mg/m2/day by venous infusion for 5 days with a median of four cycles of chemotherapy (range, 2-6). All patients were assessable: five patients achieved a good and persistent response after a median follow-up of 14 months (5-31), two achieved a good response but relapsed after a follow-up of 15 and 36 months. One out of the three partial responders have a persistent response. The treatment was well tolerated. FDR appears to be an efficient therapy with a favorable toxicity profile for patients in relapse after splenectomy or resistant to CLB. Furthermore it could constitute an alternative to splenectomy in older patients. A longer follow-up and the study of a larger group of patients are warranted to confirm our findings.
