The aim of the study was to determine the rate of transmission of drug resistant human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) variants among therapy-naive HIV positive patients in Poland in the year 2008, to compare the data with the results from the years 2000 to 2007 and to monitor patterns of HIV-1 subtypes present in Polish population and their evolution. Complete protease and part of reverse transcriptase regions were sequenced from the sera of patients directed to the laboratory for drug resistance testing. The Stanford's HIVdb program was used for the interpretation of results and subtyping. The variants scoring at least "intermediate resistance" for at least one drug were considered as resistant. The results obtained were compared to those obtained in the years 2000-2007. A total of 95 patients were enrolled in the 2008 study. Homosexual transmission of infection was documented in more than 55% of all cases. The overall prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) was 5.3% (3.9% in 2007, 5.8% in 2006, and 14.1% in the years 2002-2005). The study from the years 2000 to 2001 revealed 28.7% prevalence. Preliminary analysis of the first half of 2009 shows the ratio of 7.8%. In four (4.2%) cases drug resistance was associated with protease inhibitors class, in one case (1.1%) with resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors class. In four cases (4.2%) non-B subtype was identified (C, G, CRF01_AE, CRF02_AG). An increase of percentage of drug resistant mutants-from 3.9% (2007) to 5.3% (2008)-was recognized. In this study, TDR was limited to single classes of antiretroviral drugs. HIV-1 subtype B prevails in Poland.
