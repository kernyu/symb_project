The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a mixture of vitamins and minerals on oxidative DNA damage and the resistance of DNA to H(2)O(2)-induced DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes from 80 elderly volunteers ex vivo by means of Comet assay. The intervention with vitamin complex decreased significantly the levels of DNA damage. Our results demonstrate that the vitamin complex was able to decrease H(2)O(2)-induced DNA breakage. Our data suggest that the consumption of some vitamins may reduce the effects of oxidative DNA damage and may be useful for attaining healthy aging.
