Antiretroviral therapy continues to rapidly evolve and complex drug interactions are common. The quick reference guide is an attempt to summarize the following aspects of highly active antiretroviral treatment in concise tables: dosing of antiretroviral agents; drug-drug interactions between antiretroviral agents; antiretroviral resistance mutations and interactions of antiretroviral agents with TB-medications, oral contraceptives and methadone. Dosing and drug interaction data has been collected from manufacturers' dosing information, peer reviewed medical journals and scientific meetings. References are inserted directly in the tables referring to conferences or publication the information is derived from. In order to remain clinically relevant, regular updates to this publication are posted on the Medscape Web site at http://hiv.medscape.com/updates/quickguide - Please check regularly to ensure you are using the most recent edition. It is available as an HTML document; a PDF document; and for downloading to your Palm organizer.
