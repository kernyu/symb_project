Recent studies have suggested that community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections are encroaching upon nosocomial settings. We assessed the performance characteristics of a rule using the antimicrobial phenotype to predict genotype. This rule could be applied for epidemiologic purposes to describe the trend in CA-MRSA infections over time.
