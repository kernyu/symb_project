Structured treatment interruption in HIV is now being debated. There are 2 cases in which it may be discussed: when the initial treatment was started early and when there is no compliance to treatment [Yeni P, et al. Les nouvelles recommandations de prise en charge des personnes infectees par le VIH 2006. Paris: Flammarion medecine-sciences; 2006]. Noncompliant behavior is one of the characteristics of chronic illness during adolescence. In HIV infection, however, the prognosis is negatively influenced because the resulting resistance to the antiretroviral therapy can further reduce therapeutic options. Therefore, it is important in such a critical period to consider both what is consciously and unconsciously at stake and what responsible action could be taken when a specialist is faced with spontaneous (unplanned) treatment interruption. We report here examples of follow-up care, interruption, and resumption of treatment in 4 female adolescents.
