Monitoring anthelmintic resistance in strongyle nematodes by the faecal egg count reduction test and a commercial larval development assay on an organized sheep farm in the semi-arid area of Rajasthan revealed the emergence of resistance to benzimidazoles and rafoxanide and a potential risk of the development of levamisole/tetramisole resistance. A benzimidazole/levamisole combination, avermectins and closantel were each found to be efficacious.
