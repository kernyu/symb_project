Two kinds of nanosize V(2)O(5) particles were synthesized in our own laboratory and concomitantly applied to V79 and L929 fibroblasts and SCCVII, B16F10 and FsaR tumor cells. The morphologies of the cells were monitored using an inverted inverse microscope equipped with digital camera, while quantitative determination of the cytotoxicity of nanosize V(2)O(5) particles was measured using crystal violet bioassay. Twenty four hours after the addition of nanosize V(2)O(5) particles (20muM), noticeable changes in the morphology and density of fibroblast and cancer cells were observed. Reculturing in a freshly prepared medium for the next 24h showed a high recovery effect on V79, SCCVII and B16F10 cells, while FsaR and L929 cells were seriously damaged and unable to recover. At a higher concentration of nanosize V(2)O(5) particles (100muM), the cytotoxicity of V(2)O(5) prevailed against the recovery effect in all cell types. Quantitative measurements have shown that the resistance of investigated cell cultures to the cytotoxicity of nanosize V(2)O(5) particles decreases in the order V79>SCCVII>B16F10>FsaR>L929. The high cytotoxic effect found on FsaR cells suggests that nanosize V(2)O(5) particles could be regarded as poisoning material in the treatment of FsaR fibrosarcoma cells. Possible mechanisms involved in the cytotoxicity of nanosize V(2)O(5) particles were discussed.
