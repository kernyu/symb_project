Betalactamases production is one of the main bacterial resistance mechanisms to betalactam antibiotics. The use of bectalactamases inhibitors combined with betalactam antibiotics allows the inactivation of certain betalactamases produced by Gram positive, Gram negative and anaerobic organisms, and even by mycobacteria. Betalactamases inhibitors are an improved therapeutic alternative compared with the other betalactam since, in most cases, they cover a wider antimicrobial spectrum than their analogues. Betalactamases enzimatic activity is specifically directed to the betalactam ring hydrolisis, producing a compound without antibacterial activity. According to their genomic position within microorganisms, betalactamases can be either chromosomic or plasmidic. Currently there are three betalactamases inhibitors locally available: clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam. Of them, only sulbactam has an intrinsic antimicrobial activity against penicillin binding proteins. The clinical experience from over 20 years confirms that the combination of betalactam antibiotics is effective in the empirical initial treatment of respiratory, intraabdominal, urinary tract and gynecologic infections, including those of polymicrobial origin. In the specific case of amoxicillin-sulbactam, experiences have shown the effectiveness of the combination in the treatment of peritonsillar abscess, otitis media, sinusitis, community acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonar disease (COPD), urinary tract infection and obstetric/gynecologic infections. The spectrum and pharmacologic properties of this combination makes it also an excellent option for the treatment of skin/soft tissue and intraabdominal infections.
