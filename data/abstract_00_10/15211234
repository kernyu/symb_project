BACKGROUND: Pristinamycin is a bactericidal antibiotic whose spectrum covers the main respiratory pathogens including S. pneumoniae poorly sensitive to penicillin. It has not yet been evaluated in short course treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive bronchitis (AECB). METHODS: 476 patients suffering from an AECB were randomised to either a short course of pristinamycin, 3 G daily for 4 days, or conventional treatment with co-amoxiclav (AAC) 2G daily for 8 days. The duration of follow-up was 6 months. RESULTS: The clinical success rate at 21 days was the same in both groups at 87.2% and 87.9%, CI95% [-7.0%, 6.0%], in the protocol population (FEV1<80%). Among the 120 patients in whom a bacterial pathogen was isolated at the time of inclusion a satisfactory bacteriological response was obtained in 84.6% of the PRI patients against 78.2% of the AAC patients. The time to relapse was comparable with a relapse rate of 25% reached in 128 days in the PRI group and 125 days in the AAC group. Treatment related side effects occurred in 9.2% of the PRI group and in 10.6% of the AAC group. CONCLUSION: Pristinamycin 3 G daily for 4 days is as effective and well tolerated as co-amoxiclav 2G daily for 8 days in the treatment of AECB.
