Increasing resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa to multiple antibiotics has been observed and is posing therapeutic dilemmas. Antibiotic utilization is one factor that has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. We examined the overall and specific antimicrobial use in relation to changes in susceptibility patterns in P. aeruginosa. Regression analysis was performed to explore the relationships between annual antibiotic use and the incidence of resistant P. aeruginosa. There were statistically significant relationships between increasing anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin and levofloxacin use and the increasing incidence of ciprofloxacin resistant P. aeruginosa. However, there was not an association between other fluoroquinolone or overall fluoroquinolone use and this change. In addition, there was no association between increasing anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin use and cefepime resistant P. aeruginosa. No statistical relationship was seen with overall antibiotic use and the development of resistance in P. aeruginosa, suggesting that the development of resistance is associated with the use of individual agents, rather than overall antibiotic consumption.
