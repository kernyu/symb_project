Methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) pose a challenge to clinicians and health administrators in human medicine, but MRS infections in cats and dogs are not perceived as a problem in veterinary medicine. Ten methicillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates obtained from healthy and diseased cats and dogs were subjected to partial DNA sequencing of the mecA gene. Sequence analysis shows that MRS isolates from both healthy and diseased cats and dogs can harbor the mecA gene. The mecA genes of animal isolates were identical to that found in human MRS strains, and therefore the possibility of zoonotic transfer must be considered.
