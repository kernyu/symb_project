We report on lead optimization of a compound that was originally discovered to bind bacterial 23S rRNA near the L11 binding site and inhibit translation in vitro, but lacked detectable antibacterial activity. In this study, we were able to generate compounds with antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, including a methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain.
