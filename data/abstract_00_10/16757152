Ertapenem activity in vitro was compared with that of nine reference antibiotics against 337 anaerobes by determining minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs). Amongst 246 Gram-negative anaerobes, 4, 8, 3, 4, 7, 2 and 52 strains showed resistance to ertapenem, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoxitin, imipenem and clindamycin, respectively, and all strains were inhibited by metronidazole. Ertapenem MIC(50) values were 0.5, 0.25, 0.06 and <or=0.03mg/L for the Bacteroides fragilis group, Prevotella spp., fusobacteria and Gram-positive cocci, respectively. Overall resistance rates were 2.1%, 51.3%, 2.4%, 1.2%, 1.5%, 7.1%, 0.6%, 22% and 1.5% for ertapenem, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole, respectively. Ertapenem showed a broad spectrum and good activity against anaerobes.
