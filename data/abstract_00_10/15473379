Non typhi-salmonella is the most common cause of hospitalization or death associated with acute diarrhea. It is usually a self limiting disease and antibiotic therapy is not required, but in immunocompromised people it is essential. Increasing antimicrobial resistance in salmonella, in future, would limit the therapeutic options. During 2002, 198 persons were hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. The 55% of cases were female, the age ranged between 4 and 94 years and the 25% of them were > 60 years old. The 58.5% of hospitalizations occurred between June and October. Non-typhi salmonella was isolated in the stool of 49 persons, with a rate of hospitalization of 24.7% respect to other causes of gastroenteritis. The incidence of resistance that was defined as resistance to one or more drugs was 14.3%. Only one non-typhi salmonella showed a multiple resistance (> four drugs). Among all antibiotics tested, only the fluorquinolones showed a susceptibility in vitro in all strains. Non typhoidal Salmonellosis is a public healt problem in the world and it will be important to restrict the use of antibiotics in medicine and veterinary to reduce the spread of multiresistant strains.
