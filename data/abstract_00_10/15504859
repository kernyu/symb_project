LB11058 is a new synthetic cephalosporin with good affinity for staphylococcal penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a). LB11058 was tested in vitro and in rats with experimental aortic endocarditis against three methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains, one penicillinase-negative strain (strain COL), and two penicillinase-producing strains (COL-Bla+ and P8-Hom). The MICs of LB11058 for the organisms were 1 mg/liter. The MICs of vancomycin and ceftriaxone were 1 and >/=64 mg/liter, respectively. In population analysis profiles, none of the MRSA strains grew at >/=2 mg of LB11058/liter. Rats with endocarditis were treated for 5 days. LB11058 was highly bound to serum proteins in rats (>/=98%). However, binding was saturable above a threshold of 250 mg/liter. Therefore, continuous concentrations of 250 mg/liter in serum were infused to ensure a free fraction (>/=5 mg/liter) above the drug's MIC for the entire infusion period. Control treatments included simulation of human serum kinetics produced by intravenous vancomycin (1 g twice daily, free drug concentration above MIC, >/=90% of infusion period) or ceftriaxone (2 g/24 h, free drug concentrations above the MIC, 0% of infusion period). LB11058 successfully treated 10 of 10 (100%) and 13 of 14 (93%) of rats infected with COL-Bla+ and P8-Hom, respectively. This was comparable to vancomycin (sterilization of 8 of 12 [66%] and 6 of 8 [75%] rats, respectively). Ceftriaxone was inactive. Low concentrations of LB11058 (5 and 10 mg/liter, continuously infused) in serum were ineffective, as predicted by the pharmacodynamic parameters. At appropriate doses, LB11058 was highly effective both in vitro and in vivo. This finding supports the development of this beta-lactam with high PBP2a affinity for the treatment of MRSA infections.
