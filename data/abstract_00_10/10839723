Evolutionary considerations implicate infectious causation of atherosclerosis and help to resolve different risk factors as parts of an overall process of disease causation. An evolutionary approach also provides insight for the timing of research efforts to provide better control of pathogen evolution. In particular, evolutionary considerations emphasize the need to understand the transmissibility of Chlamydia pneumoniae from systemic infections in order to control the evolution of antibiotic resistance.
