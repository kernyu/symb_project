Two controlled tests were performed to investigate the benzimidazole resistance of a nodular worm isolate "GIBZ" from a pig breeding farm in Germany. In Trial I, groups of five pigs, artificially infected with Oesophagostomum larvae isolated from that farm were treated with flubendazole at a single dose of 5 mg kg(-1) bodyweight (BW) or remained untreated. In Trial II, three groups of three pigs each infected with larvae after a further laboratory passage of this isolate were treated with flubendazole either at a single dose of 5 mg kg(-1) BW or at a divided dose of 1.5 mg kg(-1) BW daily for 5 consecutive days, or with fenbendazole at a single dose of 5 mg kg(-1) BW, the fourth infected group remained untreated. The respective doses of anthelmintics were mixed with a small amount of feed and administered to individual pigs in both trials. Fecal egg counts before and after treatment and post-mortem worm burdens 7 days after (last) treatment were examined to assess the anthelmintic efficacies. Only infections with Oesophagostomum dentatum were found in both trials. In Trial I, the mean worm count reduction by flubendazole was 30% as compared to the untreated controls. In Trial II, flubendazole administered at a single or divided dose reduced the mean worm burden by 0 and 85%, respectively, whereas fenbendazole was 100% effective. These results establish resistance to flubendazole in the isolate "GIBZ" of O. dentatum. The failure to reveal side resistance to fenbendazole may be explained by that the currently recommended dose rate of this compound is supra-optimal for porcine nodular worms.
