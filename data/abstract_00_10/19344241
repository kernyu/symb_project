Retapamulin is a new topical pleuromutilin antibiotic for the treatment of skin and skin-structure infections, including impetigo. In vitro studies indicate that retapamulin has a unique mode of action that minimizes the potential for target-specific cross-resistance with other antibacterials and a limited potential for resistance development. Its spectrum of activity includes the most likely causative pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. In the Global Surveillance Program, retapamulin was highly active in vitro, including against strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin, mupirocin or fusidic acid. In clinical studies, retapamulin was noninferior to fusidic acid and oral cefalexin, achieving per-pathogen success rates of 86-99%. Topical retapamulin has a good safety profile and is associated with high patient compliance.
