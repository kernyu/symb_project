Infection with voriconazole-resistant fungi may become problematic, because organisms with decreased susceptibility have been noted. Breakthrough fungal infections occurred in 13 of 139 patients who received voriconazole at our center during the period of September 1998 through September 2003. Zygomycetes were found in 6 patients, and Candida glabrata bloodstream infection occurred in 4 patients. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were > or =1 microg/mL for all available isolates. Yeasts and molds with decreased susceptibility to voriconazole may cause invasive infection in patients treated successfully for aspergillosis.
