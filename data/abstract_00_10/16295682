Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are plasmid mediated enzymes capable of hydrolyzing penicillins, broad spectrum-cephalosporins and monobactams. The ESBL producing K. pneumoniae strains are being reported from around the world including India. The present study was taken up to evaluate the ESBL production and in-vitro susceptibility of K. pneumoniae isolates from a hospital. The bacterial isolates collected during 2003 included 51 K. pneumoniae biochemically confirmed isolates from 395 patients admitted in various wards of a major hospital in New Delhi. The isolates were from pus, wound, pleural fluid, urine and tracheal aspirate of patients attending respiratory, urology and burns wards. Antimicrobial susceptibility was carried out by Kirby Bauer's disc diffusion technique using NCCLS criteria. A screening of ESBL production was done by Double-disc synergy test (DDST) and using E-test ESBL strips. The frequency of resistance among K. pneumoniae for the cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime) and non-cephalosporins (aztreonam, piperacillin, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) were in the range of 39.2-88.0% and 51.0-90.2% respectively. 14 different antimicrobial resistance profiles were recognized ranging from resistance to only four (n=6, 11.7%) to as many as ten (n=9, 17.7%). Among the 51 isolates of K. pneumoniae strains, a total of 36 (70.6%) could be identified as ESBL producers, that correlates with the high frequency of multi-drug resistant K. pneumoniae The study shows alarming rise in ESBL production among K. pneumoniae strains and high rate of resistance to a wide range of cephalosporin and non-cephalosporin group of antimicrobials.
