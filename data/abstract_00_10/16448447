Five agents are currently approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection. This article will discuss the three agents for which the most extensive data are available; interferon (IFN), lamivudine, and adefovir, while the following article by Dr. Jules Dienstag will discuss the recently marketed agents, entecavir and peginterferon alfa-2a. The advantages of IFN are its finite duration of therapy (4-6 months), lack of emergence of resistance, and durability of response. On the negative side, response to IFN is less durable in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV). Also, use of IFN is limited by adverse effects and the mode of administration (daily to thrice-weekly subcutaneous injection). Lamivudine and adefovir are orally administered and have good tolerability and safety. Even in patients who experience a marked decrease in serum HBV DNA and loss of HBeAg, oral therapy needs to be continued for at least 6 months, to avoid the risk of reappearance of HBeAg and viremia. Rates of HBeAg seroconversion to anti-HBe-positivity increase with duration of lamivudine or adefovir therapy. The likelihood of development of resistance to lamivudine and associated viral breakthrough limits its long-term use. In patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, long-term therapy is usually required, as off-treatment relapse is common. The emergence of resistance to adefovir is delayed and infrequent, hence adefovir may be preferred in patients requiring long-term therapy.
