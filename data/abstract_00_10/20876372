Oritavancin is an investigational lipoglycopeptide in clinical development for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. In this study, we demonstrate that oritavancin causes bacterial membrane depolarization and permeabilization leading to cell death of Gram-positive pathogens and that these effects are attributable to the 4'-chlorobiphenylmethyl group of the molecule.
