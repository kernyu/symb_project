In olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus infected with lymphocystis disease virus (LDV) bath treatment with formalin, hydrogen peroxide or Jenoclean at 50, 100, and 200 ppm daily 10 min for 60 days enhanced the innate immune response and disease resistance. Jenoclean enhanced the immune parameters at the lowest concentration of 50 ppm; on the other hand, hydrogen peroxide bath treatment enhanced the immunity level at 100 ppm, while formalin was effective only at 200 ppm. A low cumulative mortality and high relative percent survival was noted in Jenoclean treated group followed by formalin and hydrogen peroxide treated groups. In olive flounder at low concentrations of 50 ppm or 100 ppm hydrogen peroxide and Jenoclean effectively prevent LDV infection.
