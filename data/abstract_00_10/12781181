Molecular modeling studies show that the 2',3'-double bond of the sugar moiety of various 2',3'-unsaturated nucleosides interacts with the aromatic moiety of Tyr115 of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) by hydrophobic pi-pi interaction. In 3TC-resistant mutant (M184V) RT, 2'-fluoro-2',3'-unsaturated nucleosides with a bulky 4'-substituent experience significant steric hindrance with the side chain of Val184.
