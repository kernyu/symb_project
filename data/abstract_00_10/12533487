In Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis, we identified a gene that would encode a protein highly similar to NorM of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Y. Morita et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42:1778-1782, 1998). A nonpolar insertional mutation in either the gonococcal or meningococcal norM gene resulted in increased bacterial sensitivity to compounds harboring a quaternary ammonium on an aromatic ring (e.g., ethidium bromide, acriflavine hydrochloride, 2-N-methylellipticinium, and berberine). The presence of point mutations within the -35 region of a putative norM promoter or a likely ribosome binding site resulted in an increased resistance of gonococci and meningococci to the same compounds, as well as to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Structure-activity relationship studies with putative NorM substrates have found that a cationic moiety is essential for NorM recognition.
