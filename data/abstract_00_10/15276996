Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Gallinarum (S. gallinarum) is the causative organism of fowl typhoid, and an outbreak of fowl typhoid in Korea was confirmed in 1992. The aim of this study was to investigate possible changes in fluoroquinolone susceptibility among S. gallinarum isolates from 1995 to 2001, and to analyse mutations of the gyrA gene in fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates. Among 258 S. gallinarum isolates tested by the disk diffusion method, isolates from 1995 (n=18) were susceptible to all fluoroquinolones tested, whereas a number of isolates from 2001 (n=46) showed reduced susceptibility to enrofloxacin (6.5%), ciprofloxacin (10.9%), norfloxacin (52.5%) and ofloxacin (82.6%). The minimum inhibitory concentration range of enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and danofloxacin increased from < or =0.06 approximately 0.25 microg/ml in 1995 to 2 approximately 8 microg/ml in 2001. When amino acid changes in the gyrA were analysed by DNA sequencing, 22.5% and 14.7% among 258 isolates had a mutation at the Ser-83 and Asp-87 codons, respectively, and the prevalence of these mutants increased from 5.6% in 1995 to 89.1% in 2001. These mutants contained a change from Ser to Phe or Tyr at codon 83, or a change from Asp to Gly, Tyr or Asn at codon 87, and showed a range of minimum inhibitory concentrations of enrofloxacin from 0.5 to 8 microg/ml, ciprofloxacin from 0.25 to 4 microg/ml, norfloxacin from 2 to 32 microg/ml, ofloxacin from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml, and danofloxacin from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. These results suggested an important association between the gyrA mutations and fluoroquinolone resistance of S. gallinarum.
