Invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae infections in children are associated with serious consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. The main objective of the study was to determine if invasive infections caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) differed in clinical presentation, outcome, risk factors, or cost from those caused by penicillin-susceptible strains (PSSP) in children. All patients aged 18 or less with invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae infections admitted to two teaching hospitals in Montreal between 1989 and 1998 were included in the study. We present a case-control study in which for each index case of PRSP, 3 controls with PSSP infections were matched for age, sex, and site of infection. One hundred and forty-four patients were included in the analysis (36 cases, 108 controls). There was no difference between the two groups in terms of initial clinical presentation (vital signs, laboratory results) or total length of stay. Mortality was 2.7% in both groups. Hospital antibiotic cost was higher in the PRSP group (211 Canadian dollars (CAD) vs. 74 CAD; P=0.02). Antibiotic consumption in the preceding month was significantly associated with PRSP infection. Underlying diseases or day-care attendance were not shown to be significant risk factors for acquiring invasive PRSP infection. There were no differences between invasive infections caused by PRSP and PSSP in terms of clinical presentation, morbidity or mortality in a paediatric population.
