In vitro evolution was used to predict whether the IMP-1 metallo-beta-lactamase has the potential to evolve an increased ability to confer resistance to imipenem. Screening of eight libraries containing 9.8 x 10(6) +/- 1.4 x 10(6) (mean +/- standard error) variants per library, with an average of 1.2 mutations per variant, detected no increased resistance to imipenem. The results predict, with >99.9% confidence, that even under intense selection the IMP-1 beta-lactamase will not evolve to confer increased resistance to imipenem.
