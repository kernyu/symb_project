BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B is a worldwide health problem. Research interests have focused on the development of potent and safe antiviral agents with low resistance rates. Telbivudine is a nucleoside analogue that has been approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B. OBJECTIVE: This review article concentrates on the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of telbivudine. The resistance and safety profiles are also addressed. METHODS: Relevant publications were identified from searches of MEDLINE (1996-June 2007), the Cochrane Library and BIOSIS (1993-June 2007). Search items included, but were not limited to, telbivudine, pharmacokinetics, hepatitis B, resistance and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical trials demonstrated telbivudine to be a safe and potent antiviral agent for treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Telbivudine has superior efficacy compared to lamivudine and adefovir.
