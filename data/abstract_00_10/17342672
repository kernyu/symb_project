Gonorrhea, the second most commonly reported notifiable disease, is an important cause of cervicitis, urethritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. The selection of appropriate therapy for gonorrhea (i.e., safe, highly effective, single dose, and affordable) is complicated by the ability of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to develop resistance to antimicrobial therapies. This article reviews the key questions and data that informed the 2006 gonorrhea treatment recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Key areas addressed include the criteria used to select effective treatment for gonorrhea, the level of antimicrobial resistance at which changing treatment regimens is recommended, the epidemiology of resistance, and the use of quinolones, cephalosporins, and other classes of antimicrobials for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea.
