A Cryptococcus neoformans strain from cutaneous lesions of a patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura was tested for in vitro susceptibility against seven conventional antifungal agents. The strain was susceptible to fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole and miconazole but was resistant to 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC). Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values obtained against amphotericin B and terbinafine were 1 and 4 microg ml(-1), respectively. The isolate belonged to serotype D. Few human cases of cryptococcosis have been reported over the last 50 years in Turkey. This is the first C. neoformans isolate in Turkey shown to have primary resistance to 5-FC. Primary resistance to flucytosine is rarely reported in C. neoformans and may be associated with treatment failure in some cases.
