In the present study we describe the isolation and functional analysis of a sphingolipid biosynthetic gene, IPT1, of Candida albicans. The functional consequence of the disruption of both alleles of IPT1 was confirmed by mass analysis of its sphingolipid composition. The disruption of both alleles or a single allele of IPT1 did not lead to any change in growth phenotype or total sphingolipid, ergosterol, or phospholipid content of the mutant cells. The loss of mannosyl diinositol diphosphoceramide [M(IP)(2)C] in the ipt1 disruptant, however, resulted in increased sensitivity to drugs like 4-nitroquinoline oxide, terbinafine, o-phenanthroline, fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole. The increase in drug susceptibilities of ipt1 cells was linked to an altered sphingolipid composition, which appeared to be due to the impaired functionality of Cdr1p, a major drug efflux pump of C. albicans that belongs to the ATP binding cassette superfamily. Our confocal and Western blotting results demonstrated that surface localization of green fluorescent protein-tagged Cdr1p was affected in ipt1 disruptant cells. Poor surface localization of Cdr1p resulted in an impaired ability to efflux fluconazole and rhodamine 6G. The effect of mannosyl inositol phosphoceramide accumulation in the ipt1 mutant and the absence of M(IP)(2)C from the ipt1 mutant on the efflux of drug substrates was very selective. The efflux of methotrexate, a specific substrate of CaMdr1p, another major efflux pump of major facilitator superfamily, remained unaffected in ipt1 mutant cells. Interestingly, changes in sphingolipid composition affected the ability of mutant cells to form proper hyphae in various media. Taken together, our results demonstrate that an altered composition of sphingolipid, which is among the major constituents of membrane rafts, affects the drug susceptibilities and morphogenesis of C. albicans.
