Histatin 5, a human salivary protein with broad-spectrum antifungal activity, is remarkably ineffective against Candida glabrata. Fluconazole resistance in this fungus is due in most cases to upregulation of CgCDR efflux pumps. We investigated whether the distinct resistance of C. glabrata to histatin 5 is related to similar mechanisms.
