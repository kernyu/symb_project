There is concern about the increasing transmission of drug-resistant HIV to uninfected persons. Harboring a resistant variant of HIV-1 can influence the antiviral effect of the initial treatment regimen. These strains may be resistant to 1 or more of the existing classes of antiretrovirals. Use of resistance testing before initiating antiretroviral therapy to identify persons with acquired resistance is becoming more common. For these persons, as well as for highly treatment-experienced patients who may be transmitting drug-resistant HIV, the use of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, possibly including investigational agents that retain activity against these isolates, may be a valuable approach to treatment.
