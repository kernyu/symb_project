A short-course regimen of zidovudine plus lamivudine starting from 34 weeks' gestation in pregnant women to prevent mother-to-child HIV infection, and discontinued after delivery, was evaluated for the development of resistance at 6 weeks postpartum. No resistant mutation was found in 32 women. One of the three infected infants carried the M184V and K219Q mutations.
