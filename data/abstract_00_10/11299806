Paclitaxel has recently been shown to be effective in treating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. We report good therapeutic effects of paclitaxel in two patients with classical form Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) which had poor or partial response to chemotherapy (vincristine, vinblastine, oncovin, bleomycin, epirubicin, dactinomycin, decarbazine) and interferon alpha-2b. Paclitaxel appears to be active against Kaposi's sarcoma as a single agent. The experience suggests that paclitaxel is an effective alternative in the treatment of classical form Kaposi's sarcoma.
