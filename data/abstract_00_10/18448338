Overexpression of cIAP1 correlates with resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in various cancers. Recently, we reported that a class of bestatin ester analogs represented by MeBS (2) destabilized and promoted the degradation of cIAP1 through auto-ubiquitination, and thereby sensitized cancer cells to apoptosis. Herein, we present chemical evidence that bestatin ester analogs directly interact with the cIAP1-BIR3 domain by means of fluorescence polarization assay and photoaffinity labeling assay using fluorescent probes.
