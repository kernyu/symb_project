The World Health Organization Western Pacific Region Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme examined about 8,700 isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from 15 countries for resistance to antibiotics in 2005. High to very high rates of resistance to penicillins and quinolones persisted in most centres. Increasing numbers of gonococci with decreased susceptibility to third generation cephalosporins were found in several countries. There were infrequent instances of spectinomycin resistance.
