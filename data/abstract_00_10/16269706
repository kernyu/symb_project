A total of 318 Escherichia coli isolates obtained from diarrheic and healthy pigs in Ontario from 2001 to 2003 were examined for their susceptibility to 19 antimicrobial agents. They were tested by PCR for the presence of resistance genes for tetracycline, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and apramycin and of 12 common virulence genes of porcine E. coli. Antimicrobial resistance frequency among E. coli isolates from swine in Ontario was moderate in comparison with other countries and was higher in isolates from pigs with diarrhea than in isolates from healthy finisher pigs. Resistance profiles suggest that cephamycinases may be produced by > or = 8% of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Resistance to quinolones was detected only in enterotoxigenic E. coli (< or = 3%). The presence of sul3 was demonstrated for the first time in Canada in porcine E. coli isolates. Associations were observed among tetA, sul1, aadA, and aac(3)IV and among tetB, sul2, and strA/strB, with a strong negative association between tetA and tetB. The paa and sepA genes were detected in 92% of porcine ETEC, and strong statistical associations due to colocation on a large plasmid were observed between tetA, estA, paa, and sepA. Due at least in part to gene linkages, the distribution of resistance genes was very different between ETEC isolates and other porcine E. coli isolates. This demonstrates that antimicrobial resistance epidemiology differs significantly between pathogenic and commensal E. coli isolates. These results may have important implications with regards to the spread and persistence of resistance and virulence genes in bacterial populations and to the prudent use of antimicrobial agents.
