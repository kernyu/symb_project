Cyclosporin A, a potent immunosuppressant, can often produce neurotoxicity in patients, although its penetration into the brain is restricted by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Brain pericytes and astrocytes, which are periendothelial accessory structures of the BBB, can be involved in cyclosporin A-induced BBB disruption. However, the mechanism by which cyclosporin A causes BBB dysfunction remains unknown. Here, we show that in rodent brain endothelial cells, cyclosporin A decreased transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) by inhibiting intracellular signal transduction downstream of adrenomedullin, an autocrine regulator of BBB function. Cyclosporin A stimulated adrenomedullin release from brain endothelial cells, but did not affect binding of adrenomedullin to its receptors. This cyclosporin A-induced decrease in TEER was attenuated by exogenous addition of adrenomedullin. Cyclosporin A dose-dependently decreased the total cAMP concentration in brain endothelial cells. A combination of cyclosporin A (1microM) with an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, 9-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine (SQ22536; 10microM), or a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride (H89; 1microM), markedly increased sodium fluorescein permeability in brain endothelial cells, whereas each drug alone had no effect. Thus, these data suggest that cyclosporin A inhibits the adenylyl cyclase/cyclic AMP/PKA signaling pathway activated by adrenomedullin, leading to impairment of brain endothelial barrier function.
