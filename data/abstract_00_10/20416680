The purpose of this study was to investigate lactobacilli for potential probiotic use in Iberian dry-fermented sausages. A total of 18 strains, previously selected, isolated from different sources were evaluated according to safety and functional characteristics including biogenic amines and d-lactic acid production, antibiotic susceptibility, haemolysis, cell adhesion, and antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens. The strains Lactobacillus reuteri PL519, L. reuteri PL542, and Lactobacillus fermentum HL57 were able to establish their self on the intestinal epithelium, and an inhibition of such pathogenic bacteria as Listeria monocytogenesin vitro. These strains were also considered safe to be used with regard to their low aminogenic potential and d-lactic acid production, antibiotic resistance pattern and haemolytic activity. Thus, they were selected as a potential probiotic meat starter culture suitable for manufacture of dry-fermented Iberian sausages.
