We report the case of a 26-day-old premature infant born at 24 weeks' gestation who developed septicemia while receiving vancomycin therapy. The blood isolate initially identified as a vancomycin-resistant Streptococcous viridans was found to be Leuconostoc spp. Her condition improved with parenteral ampicillin and gentamicin therapy and removal of the intravenous central catheter. Prematurity is a recognized risk factor for Leuconostoc disease. Clinicians need to consider Leuconostoc spp. when vancomycin-resistant pathogens are identified and provide appropriate therapy.
