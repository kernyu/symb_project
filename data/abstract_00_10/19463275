BACKGROUND: Micafungin is a new and very useful pharmacological tool for the treatment of invasive mycoses with a wide antifungal spectrum for the most common pathogenic fungi. Micafungin is especially active against the genera Candida and Aspergillus. Its antifungal mechanism is based on the inhibition of the beta-1,3- D-glucan synthesis, an essential molecule for the cell wall architecture, with different con sequences for Candida and Aspergillus, being micafungin fungicide for the former and fungistatic for the latter. AIM: To describe the in vitro antifungal spectrum of micafungin based in the scientific and medical lite rature of recent years. METHODS: We have done a bibliographic retrieval using the scientific terms, "micafungin", "activity", "Candida", "Aspergillus", "fungi", "mycos*", "susceptibility", in PubMed/Medline from the National Library of Medicine de EE.UU. from 2005 to 2009. RESULTS: We can underline that most than 99% of Candida isolates are susceptible to < or = 2microg/ml of micafungin. MIC are very low (< or = 0.125microg/ml) for most clinical isolates of the species Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei while Candida parapsilosis and Candida guilliermondii isolates are susceptible to anidulafungin concentrations < or = 2microg/ml. The activity of micafungin is excellent against those medical important species of Aspergillus. However, its activity is very low against Cryptococcus and the Zygomycetes. CONCLUSIONS: The excellent activity of micafungin has made this antifungal a first line therapeutic indication for candidemia and invasive candidiasis in non-neutropenic patients.
