Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias are difficult to eradicate completely without extensive surgical intervention. Cidofovir, a deoxycytidine monophosphate analog, may have a therapeutic role in this disease. A 43-year-old woman with a 20-year history of genital warts presented with extensive vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia III, and refused surgical resection. Topical cidofovir 1% in Beeler base completely eradicated the lesion. Successive treatment applications, however, were necessary. Cidofovir is a promising topical antiviral compound for HPV induced vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.
