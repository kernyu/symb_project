Resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to penicillin G is common among isolates from bovine mastitis. We determined phenotypic resistance to penicillin G for 151 S. aureus isolates derived from dairy cows with intramammary infection by two methods. The methods were determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by a standard agar dilution technique and direct testing of beta-lactamase production using a chromogenic cephalosporin, nitrocefin. The results from these tests were compared with the presence of the beta-lactamase (blaZ) gene in the isolates, which was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Testing beta-lactamase production with nitrocefin was more predictive for the presence of the blaZ gene than the agar dilution method and the results of the former agreed highly with the presence of the blaZ gene in the isolates. In contrast, the resistance breakpoint generally used in the agar dilution method may be too high for prediction of penicillin resistance in S. aureus isolates with borderline MICs. Using this method, 40% of the isolates possessing the blaZ gene were classified as susceptible; however, majority of these isolates produced beta-lactamase when tested with nitrocefin.
