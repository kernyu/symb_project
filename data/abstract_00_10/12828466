Machaerium multiflorum yielded two additional new (+)-trans-hexahydrodibenzopyrans (HHDBP's), machaeriol C (1) and machaeriol D (2), and three new 5,6-seco-HHDBP's, machaeridiol A (3), machaeridiol B (4), and machaeridiol C (5). Their structures and stereochemistries were determined by 1D and 2D NMR data, including HMBC, NOESY, and circular dichroism experiments. Machaeriol C (1) demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (IC(50) 0.65 microg/mL) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (IC(50) 0.70 microg/mL), while its corresponding 5,6-seco-analogues machaeridiol A (3) and machaeridiol B (4) showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus and MRSA (IC(50) 1.0-2.6 microg/mL) and antifungal activity against Candida albicans (IC(50), 2.0-3.5 microg/mL). In addition, machaeridiol B (4) demonstrated antiparasitic activities against Plasmodium falciparum D6 and W2 clones and Leishmania donavani with IC(50) values of 0.64, 0.22, and 0.9 microg/mL, respectively.
