Resistance to antiretroviral agents, and in particular the increasing levels of transmitted resistant virus could offset the substantial gains won with potent antiretroviral therapy. Primary and acquired antiretroviral resistance rates reflect the relative usage of different antiretroviral drugs in the population, as well as the inherent genetic barrier to the development of resistance associated with individual drugs. Data on antiretroviral resistance rates, gleaned from the growing HIV-1-infected population treated with a continuously increasing number of antiretroviral drugs and drug combinations, provide insights into patient management approaches for delaying the emergence of resistance and minimizing the degree of resistance. Evolving data suggest that the relative ease by which HIV-1 escapes the selective pressure of chronic drug exposure varies for the different antiretroviral drug classes and individual antiretroviral drugs. The development of resistance in vivo can be anticipated based on these data, in conjunction with the individuals treatment history and resistance testing results. These in turn can guide the judicious use of antiretroviral drugs to attain optimal treatment responses and to preserve therapeutic options for the time when antiretroviral-resistant strains emerge. The recent developments of new antiretroviral drugs, including the use of boosted protease inhibitors, suggest that treatment strategies can limit the development of resistance.
