Conventional methods for identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from culture can take 6 weeks. To facilitate the rapid detection of M. tuberculosis and to assess the risks of drug resistance, we developed a technique of eluting DNA directly from sputum slides and performing PCR for the detection of M. tuberculosis DNA, followed by sequencing the rpoB gene to detect rifampin resistance. This entire process requires only 48 h. Forty-seven sputum specimens submitted for microscopy for detection of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and for mycobacterial culture and susceptibility testing were assessed after elution from the slides and extraction. M. tuberculosis-specific DNA was amplified in a nested PCR with previously described primers (primers rpo95-rpo293 and rpo105-rpo273), followed by analysis on a 4% agarose gel for a 168-bp product. Automated sequencing was performed, and the sequences were aligned against a database for detection of anomalies in the rpoB gene (codons 511 to 533) which indicate rifampin resistance. Of the 47 sputum specimens tested, 51% (24 of 47) were culture positive (time to positive culture, 2 to 6 weeks). Smears for AFB were positive for 58% (14 of 24) of the specimens and were negative for 42% (10 of 24) of the specimens. All 24 culture-positive sputum specimens (14 microscopy-positive and 10 microscopy-negative sputum specimens) were positive by PCR with eluates from the smears. Forty-nine percent (23 of 47) of the sputum specimens were negative for M. tuberculosis by smear, culture, and PCR. Of the isolates from the culture-positive samples, five were rifampin resistant by sequencing; all five were also rifampin resistant by in vitro susceptibility testing. Of these rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates, two were microscopy negative for AFB. Patients who are negative for AFB and culture positive for M. tuberculosis can now be identified within a day, allowing institution of therapy and reducing isolation time and medical costs.
