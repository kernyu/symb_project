We determined the antifungal susceptibility of 50 Candida isolates from invasive mycoses in intensive care unit patients in Chile. Candida albicans (27 isolates) and C. parapsilosis (12 isolates) were the most common etiologic species. Candida glabrata (five isolates) was isolated only from children. Our data are consistent with those of recent Brazilian and Argentinean studies but differ from those of some US, Canadian and Norwegian studies, in which the relatively azole-resistant C. glabrata was the predominant non-C. albicans species seen. All isolates in this study were susceptible to amphotericin B. Itraconazole and fluconazole resistance were observed in 6 and 4% of the isolates, respectively.
