The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of paediatric uropathogens to six of the most common antibiotics in use for urinary tract infections were determined. The bacterial isolates came from the urine of children presenting as outpatients to participating US hospitals between April 2002 and May 2004. Strains of the six most common uropathogens were included in the analysis. Results were stratified by paediatric age group. In total, 11174 female and 1557 male positive cultures were analysed. The overall resistance rates for females and males, respectively, were as follows: ampicillin 44.3% and 44.6%; sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim 24.5% and 36.7%; amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 12.4% and 27.5%; cefazolin 10.9% and 27.1%; ciprofloxacin 0.9% and 2.4%; and nitrofurantoin 4.4% and 11.0%. Uropathogen resistance to commonly used antibiotics in the paediatric population was high.
