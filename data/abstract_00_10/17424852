OBJECTIVE: To study the antibiotic susceptibility of Enterobacter sakazakii isolated from powdered formula for infant and young children in Chinese market. METHODS: Sixteen strains of E. sakazakii were evaluated for antibiotic susceptibility by disk diffusion technique recommended by the National Committee of Clinical laboratory Standard. RESULTS: All of the isolates were resistant to Benzylpenicillin, Oxaxillin and Vancomycin, moreover cephazolin and Cefpodoxime except one isolate. At the same time, all the isolates were susceptible to at least 13 antibiotics. CONCLUSION: It is important to pay more attention to the use of drugs in prevention and clinic treatment to reduce the multiple-antibiotic-resistant strains and failure of experiential treatment.
