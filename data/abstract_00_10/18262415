Bacteria can coordinate community-wide behaviors through quorum sensing, that is, the secretion and sensing of autoinducer (AI) molecules. Bacterial quorum sensing is implicated in the regulation of pathologically relevant events such as biofilm formation, bacterial virulence, and drug resistance. Inhibitors of bacterial quorum sensing could therefore be useful therapeutics. Herein we report for the first time the discovery of several pyrogallol compounds as single digit micromolar inhibitors of bacterial quorum sensing in Vibrio harveyi.
