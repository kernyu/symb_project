The attenuation of the tolerability of HIV-infected patients to the infectious agents leads to the development of frequent relapses both primary pyoderma and secondary bacterial complications of dermatoses of unclear nature that aggravates current status of the main disease. Regarding about mention data, the study of biotype spectrum of infectious agents in pustular skin lesions and their resistance patterns to antibacterial preparations in patients with pyoderma and with different HIV status is of great interest. The article presents comparative results of the study of bacterial composition in the pus of 124 patients with pyoderma and HIV infection and in 70 patients with pyoderma but without HIV. It is possible on the basis of results of the analysis to note high frequency of identification of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus haemolyticus in persons without HIV infection and both primary and secondary pyoderma with the further decrease in strains in similar patients with HIV. All patients with pustular skin lesions were found to have a wide spectrum of pathogens prevalence of which depends both on HIV-status of a patient and clinical form of pyoderma. HIV-positive patients with primary pyoderma have a frequency rate of isolation of infectious agents in mixed cultures considerably higher (10 times) than this parameter in HIV-negative patients. The same tendency is observed in the analysis of cultivation rate of pathogens in patients with secondary pyoderma. However, in HIV positive patients the cultivation rate of mixed cultures increases by 2,5 times.
