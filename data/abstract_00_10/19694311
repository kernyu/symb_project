This study was conducted to determine whether there was any genetic heterogeneity among Helicobacter pylori strains isolated from the antrum and corpus of the same individual in a Malaysian population and to determine the presence of heterogeneous susceptibility of the isolates by comparing PCR-RAPD and antibiotic profiles. Forty-four H. pylori isolates cultured from the antrum and corpus of 22 patients were analyzed. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out by minimum inhibitory concentration determination, using E-Test method strips. PCR-RAPD was carried out on all the strains and the profiles generated were analysed for cluster analysis. Twenty-nine different PCR-RAPD profiles were observed in the 44 isolates. Fifteen pairs of the isolates from the same patients had the same PCR-RAPD patterns while in 7 pairs, the profiles were different. The strains were clustered into 2 separate clusters at a low coefficient of similarity, where most of the strains were in cluster 1. The degree of similarity was very low among most of the isolates. Most of the patients (16 of 22) were infected with strains that have the same antibiotic susceptibility profiles. Out of these, only 10 pairs shared the same PCR-RAPD and antibiotic profiles. Five pairs of isolates with similar PCR-RAPD profiles differed in their antibiotic profiles due to metronidazole resistance in one of the sites. A large degree of genetic heterogeneity was observed among H. pylori strains circulating among Malaysian patients. An individual patient can be infected with multiple strains and the strains can be antibiotic resistant.
