Early failures to stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine used as a generic fixed-dose combination in Mali showed resistance mutations in 50% of cases (mostly M184V and Y181C). No thymidine analogue mutations were seen, suggesting that most nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors could be used in a second-line regimen. This highlights the importance of the accessibility of HIV-RNA assays for monitoring treated patients in resource-poor countries to detect early virological failure in order to preserve future therapeutic options.
