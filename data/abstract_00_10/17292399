Secreted phospholipases A(2) (sPLA(2)s) represent a new class of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inhibitors that block the early steps of virus entry into cells. Here, we applied an in vitro evolution/selection procedure to select, from primary HIV isolates, an emerging variant (HIV(RBV-3)) able to actively infect cells in the presence of sPLA(2)s. HIV(RBV-3) represents a very atypical HIV-1 isolate because, in contrast to others, this virus requires a functional endocytic machinery to infect cells. Indeed, endocytosis inhibitors that affect endosome acidification (bafilomycin A(1), monensin) and/or endosomal trafficking (nocodazole, latrunculin A) drastically reduced HIV(RBV-3) replication. Using a standardized PCR-assay, we showed that endocytosis inhibitors block HIV(RBV-3) entry just before the reverse transcription step. Concurrently, to identify the viral proteins responsible for the HIV(RBV-3) atypical behaviour, we constructed a HIV-1 molecular chimera bearing different HIV(RBV-3) proteins. We demonstrated that the sole presence of the HIV(RBV-3) envelope glycoprotein is enough, not only to confer the resistance to sPLA(2)s, but also to direct HIV(RBV-3) to the endosomal-dependent entry pathway. Interestingly, HIV(RBV-3) envelope glycoprotein sequencing revealed an unusual structural pattern with the presence of rare mutations in the N-terminal region and V1-V2 envelope loop sequence extensions. Taken together, we conclude that HIV-1 may escape from entry inhibitors, such as sPLA2s, through the selection of a particular HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein that allows HIV to infect cells via an alternative entry route that relies on endosome trafficking.
