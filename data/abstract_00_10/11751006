An anthelmintic-sensitive Haemonchus contortus strain was selected for moxidectin and ivermectin resistance concurrently for 22 generations. Treatment with 0.002 mg moxidectin/kg BW or 0.02 mg ivermectin/kg BW produced >99% efficacy against the susceptible parent strain passaged for 22 generations without any anthelmintic exposure. However, to obtain similar efficacy the moxidectin-selected and the ivermectin-selected strains of H. contortus required 0.05 mg moxidectin/kg BW or 0.4 mg ivermectin/kg BW. These results indicate that development of resistance to one macrocyclic lactone, simultaneously results in resistance to another macrocyclic lactone. However, rates of resistance development differ between compounds and occurs more slowly with moxidectin than with ivermectin.
