Patients with primary antibody deficiency (PAD) are prone to mycoplasma infection with unusual strains which may be resistant to conventional antibiotics. Mycoplasmas were isolated from the joint fluid (Ureaplasma urealyticum) of two PAD patients with arthritis and from the cerebral spinal fluid (Mycoplasma maculosum) in one with meningitis, the latter probably originating from the patient's dog. Combinations of doxycycline and quinolones or macrolides failed to clear the infections, but after demonstrating in-vitro sensitivity to the pleuromutilin, Econor, for two of the isolates, all three patients responded to oral treatment with Econor. The infection was completely eradicated in two patients, with the emergence of a resistant strain in the third. Mycoplasma infection should be considered in PAD patients with unexplained sepsis. Pleuromutilins such as Econor are powerful new anti-mycoplasmal agents which provide an additional therapeutic option when patients fail to respond to conventional antibiotics.
