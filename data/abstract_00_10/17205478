OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) phenotypic susceptibility to didanosine and the antiviral activity of didanosine (ddI) in the JAGUAR study. METHODS: Baseline plasma HIV phenotypic susceptibility to ddI was assessed using a phenotype assay of patients randomized to receive ddI or placebo for 4 weeks in addition to their current regimen. Phenotypic susceptibility scores (PSSs) were then calculated for each sample. Associations between PSS and week 4 reductions in plasma HIV-1 RNA load or virologic response were assessed using linear regression and Jonckherre's test and the Wilcoxon and Cochran-Armitage tests, respectively. RESULTS: In the ddI arm, a significant association between reduction in viral load and continuous PSS was observed (P<.0001). Using distinct categories, an increasing fold change (FC) in susceptibility to ddI was strongly associated with smaller reductions in plasma HIV-1 RNA load (P<.0001). The proportion of virologic responders was 83% (15/18) for patients with a ddI FC < or =1.3, 50% (33/66) for patients with an FC of 1.3-2.2, and 29% (4/14) for patients with an FC > or =2.2 (P=.0008). After we determined these findings, 3 ddI FC categories were defined using 1.3 and 2.2 as thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between phenotypic susceptibility to ddI and reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA load describes a continuum. The establishment of a lower clinical cutoff at 1.3 and an upper clinical cutoff at 2.2 are clinically relevant.
