Skin and soft tissue infections are common diseases. The spectrum ranges from slight furuncles to severe necrotizing soft tissue infections. Grampositive bacteria account for 70-80 % of cases as causative organisms. Diagnostics include rapid evaluation of locally limited or diffuse spreading extent of the disease. In complicated skin and soft tissue infections, surgical intervention with debridement and necronectomy is indicated. Necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections call for programmed redebridement. If systemic signs of inflammation are present (fever > 38 degrees C, leukocytosis, CRP elevation) or significant comorbidity exists, application of antibiotics is indicated. The prognosis in operatively treated patients is dependent on the time of surgical intervention.
