The aim of this study was to establish the importance of detecting fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance in multidrug resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and to show the usefulness of a hybridization-based line probe assay (LiPA) for detecting gyrA mutations. Thirty-three MDR M. tuberculosis isolates were collected from a total of sixty MDR isolates identified in Japan over 6 months during a national surveillance study in 2002. Seventeen MDR isolates were collected by the National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Japan over 6 years from 2003 to 2008. These 50 isolates were examined for FQ susceptibility, and analysed by LiPA and gyrA sequencing. Among them, 22 (44 %) showed FQ resistance. All FQ-resistant isolates had at least one mutation in gyrA. The results of the LiPA were fully consistent with the DNA sequencing results. Given that on the basis of our results almost half of the MDR M. tuberculosis isolates in Japan might have resistance to FQ, it is important to monitor FQ resistance in patients with MDR tuberculosis (TB), as well as with drug-susceptible TB, prior to commencing treatment. For the detection of FQ resistance, LiPA is useful and can rapidly and efficiently assess FQ resistance.
