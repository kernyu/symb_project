Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, ribotyping, and fingerprinting analysis of 22 invasive isolates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pneumococci from Korea showed that 59 to 82% were genetically related. DNA sequencing of the PBP 2B gene showed relatively uniform alterations in nucleotides (5.4 to 7.8%) and amino acids (3.0 to 4. 3%), while Asn-276-->Lys, Arg-285-->Cys and Ser-305-->Phe substitutions were unique to Korean MDR strains, suggesting the spread of a few epidemic clones of resistant pneumococci within Korea.
