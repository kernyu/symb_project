In vitro inhibitory activity of rifaximin is directed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. It is effective in the treatment of gastrointestinal infections when given orally because of the high concentration of the drug remaining in the gut lumen. Laboratory investigations have been carried out to assess the in vitro activity of rifaximin on different bacterial strains isolated from both human and domestic animals. The objective of this project is to review the in vitro and in vivo activity of rifaximin against bacterial infection with Gram-negative rods, Gram-positive rods and Gram-positive cocci and their resistance to rifaximin. The available data suggest that rifaximin is active in vitro and in vivo in the treatment of bacterial infection of adults and children.
