The compound 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) enhances chemotherapy/radiotherapy in cell lines and animal models, prompting two phase I clinical trials with this cancer therapeutic. Although its mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, it is hypothesized that the molecular basis of 2-DG activity is related to glycolysis inhibition. Here, we report that 2-DG induced Akt phosphorylation at Thr(308) and Ser(473) as early as 15 min post-treatment. These phosphorylation events required phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase activity but were not related to LKB1/AMP-activated protein kinase signaling, the inhibition of glycolysis or epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. The 2-DG-mediated Akt phosphorylation also led to the phosphorylation of Akt downstream targets, such as Foxo3a, GSK3beta, and Chk1. Because the functional consequence of Akt activation includes chemotherapy/radiotherapy resistance, our data suggested that the combination of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt inhibitory agents in 2-DG-based chemotherapy/radiotherapy may result in enhanced therapeutic efficacy.
