Streptococcus pneumoniae has been a rare cause of endocarditis in the postantibiotic era. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant Pneumococcus species has been accompanied by isolated reports of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) endocarditis. We report a case of bivalvular PRSP endocarditis that was treated with vancomycin and trovafloxacin, and we review the literature on this topic.
