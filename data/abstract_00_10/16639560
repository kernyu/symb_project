A novel system was developed for efficient transformation of the fungal biocontrol agent Beauveria bassiana. Competent blastospores were prepared and stored in LiAc- and glycerol-inclusive suspension at -76 degrees C for sequential use in transformation. The system was successfully applied to integrating phosphinothricin resistance gene bar and enhanced green fluorescence protein gene egfp into B. bassiana via blastospore absorption of a plasmid vectoring bar and egfp. A frequency of 24 transformants per microgram of DNA was achieved. The blastospore-based transformation system has proven to be very convenient and would be highly potential for use in genetic manipulation of B. bassiana and other filamentous species.
