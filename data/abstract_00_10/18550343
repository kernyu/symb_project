Microorganisms resistant to multiple anti-infective agents have increased worldwide. These organisms threaten both optimal care of patients with infection as well as the viability of current healthcare systems. In addition, antimicrobials are valuable resources that enhance both prevention and treatment of infections. As resistance diminishes this resource, it is a societal goal to minimise resistance and therefore to reduce forces that produce resistance. This review considers strategies for minimising resistance that are needed at several different levels of responsibility, ranging from the patient care provider to international agencies. It then describes responses that might be appropriate according to the resources available for control, focusing on limited-resource settings. Antimicrobial resistance represents an international concern. Response to this problem demands concerted efforts from multiple sectors both in developed and developing countries, as well as the strengthening of multinational/international partnerships and regulations. Both medical and public health agencies should be in the forefront of these efforts.
