A 67-year-old diabetic male developed bilateral pulmonary mucormycosis (PM). After long-term treatment with amphotericin B (cumulative dose of 30.6 g), clinical resolution was obtained, but small radiographic cavitations persisted. A late relapse occurred and bilateral lobectomy led to a definitive cure. Amphotericin B is not able to penetrate properly into PM cavitations. We suggest that persistence of cavitations should lead to consideration of surgery, even after a good response to amphotericin B.
