Dissemination of metallo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases) was investigated retrospectively among ceftazidimeand imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in a hematology unit in Marseilles, France, from September, 1995, to March, 1999. Sixteen clinical isolates and 23 environmental strains were identified, with a same bla (VIM-2) gene that encoded a carbapenemase identified in Southern Europe and South Korea. Five different genotypes were identified among clinical and environmental P. aeruginosa isolates all harboring an approximately 45-kb plasmid with bla (VIM-2)-positive class 1 integrons varying in structures. This study identified a hidden reservoir of carbapenemase producers.
