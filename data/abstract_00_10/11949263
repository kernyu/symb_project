Antilysozyme activity (ALA) as well as antibiotic resistance were detected in 133 microbial cultures isolated from bioptic specimens of the mucous membrane of the ulcerous and periulcerous zones, taken from patients with gastric and duodenal ulcer. In 85.7-94.7% of cases Gram positive cocci and in 62.5% of cases Gram-positive bacilli showed no ALA. 50% of Gram negative bacteria cultures lacked ALA, while the remaining 50% exhibited this activity, on the average, 2.36 +/- 1.40 mkg/ml. Lysozyme activity was determined in 33.3% of the isolated staphylococci strains both with and without ALA. Staphylococci isolated from the gastric mucosa of healthy controls had no ALA in 33.3% of cases, and in 66.7% of cases ALA was equal to 2 mkg/ml. Gram positive coccal microflora showed, mainly, high sensitivity to antibiotics. In Gram negative bacteria antibiotic resistance was determined in 44.3 +/- 21.2% of the isolates. In Gram negative microorganisms correlation between ALA and antibiotic resistance was observed. From the periulcerous zone of patients with gastric and duodenal ulcer persistence associated Gram negative microorganisms were mainly isolated.
