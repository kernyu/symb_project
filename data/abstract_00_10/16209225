Data in the Caribbean documenting the speciation of yeast associated with vulvovaginitis are lacking. The widespread use of antibiotics and increased availability of antimycotic agents, both prescribed and over-the-counter, predisposes both to a change in the epidemiologic patterns and the possible development of secondary resistance among previously susceptible yeast. This study was conducted to evaluate the aetiologic agents associated with mycotic vulvovaginitis and to review the appropriateness of prescribed antifungal therapy. Of 134 positive isolates, the most frequent yeast isolate was C. albicans accounting for 78%, C. tropicalis 10%, Prototheca wickerhamii (P. wickerhamii) 5%, C. glabrata 4%, Cryptococcus albidus (C. albidus) 2% and C. lusitaniae (1%) were also isolated. Of the positive cases, 75% were treated with antifungals, 17% with antibiotics and 8% were not treated. The azole group was the most frequently prescribed antifungal (71%). Of cases with negative yeast cultures, 83% were treated with antifungals. The presence of non-albicans Candida species and other opportunistic fungi is an important finding and combined with the pattern of therapy, represents a major challenge for future empirical therapeutic and prophylactic strategies in the treatment of mycotic vulvovaginitis.
