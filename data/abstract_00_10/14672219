Contaminated apple cider has been implicated in several Escherichia coli O157:H7 outbreaks. In an attempt to investigate sources and modes of entry of E. coli into apple cider, samples of fresh apple, pomace, and cider and equipment and mill floor swabs were analyzed for standard plate counts (SPC), total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), and E. coli. E. coli was isolated from 14 (33%) of 42 samples of bottled fresh cider, from food equipment in 6 (67%) of 9 mills, and from apples, pomace, or cider in 7 (78%) of 9 mills. Seventy-five E. coli isolates were further characterized for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC)-associated virulence factors, antimicrobial susceptibility, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type. No E. coli O157:H7 or other STEC was identified. Serotyping and PFGE revealed 64 distinct profiles, suggesting that recovered E. coli arose from multiple independent sources. However, on one occasion, E. coli isolated from the source apple sample was closely related to the E. coli identified in the finished cider sample. E. coli isolates were further tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to 17 antimicrobial agents of human and veterinary importance. Fourteen (19%) of the 75 isolates were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobial agents tested, and 9 (12%) were resistant to at least two of these agents. Of the resistant isolates recovered, 64% were resistant to tetracycline and 57% were resistant to streptomycin. Overall, the level of E. coli contamination in source apple samples did not differ significantly from those in samples of pomace, cider at the press, and cider entering the bottling tank; therefore, source apples cannot be dismissed as a potential contributor of E. coli to the cider-making process.
