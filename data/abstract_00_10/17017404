Mutations in the rpoB gene of 40 biopsy isolates of Mycobacterium leprae were analyzed by reverse hybridization-based line probe assay after PCR, and nine distinct single-nucleotide substitutions were found. Among them, a 3-nucleotide substitution was found in two, and 2-nucleotide substitutions were found in seven isolates. This is a new finding of multiple mutations in a single point of the rpoB gene for rifampicin resistance. This investigation demonstrates that the pattern of mutations in the rpoB gene for rifampicin resistance in Nepal involves more variety.
