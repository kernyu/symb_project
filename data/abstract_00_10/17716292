Triclosan is widely employed in many consumer and healthcare products. The increasing employment of triclosan in a range of consumer products where there is no proven benefit for hygiene has been severely criticised. Laboratory studies demonstrate theoretical risks that the wide-scale use of triclosan might compromise its efficacy as well as the activity of third-party antibiotics. The precautionary principle would dictate against the use of triclosan, at least in those products where there was no demonstrable health benefit. The theoretical risks, however, are not supported by either field or clinical studies, or by laboratory studies using bacterial microcosms. Numerous clinical studies, as well as historical data, demonstrate the clinical benefits of hygiene adjuncts such as triclosan and triclosan/copolymer in oral care products where these compensate for deficiencies in mechanical hygiene (brushing and flossing). The balance of risk and benefit is firmly in favour of the continued use of dentifrices (toothpastes) and mouthwashes containing active agents such as triclosan.
