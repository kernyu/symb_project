A longitudinal observational study of 59 dairy herds was conducted in Washington State to estimate the rate of introduction of new multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica strains onto commercial dairy herds. Samples were collected on these herds over 7 visits separated by intervals of 2 to 4 mo over a period of 15 to 21 mo. Samples were cultured for Salmonella spp. and serogroup, serovar, and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were identified for MDR Salmonella isolates. Fingerprinting generated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using XbaI restriction enzyme digestion generated genotyping profiles for all MDR isolates identified in the study. The rate of new MDR Salmonella strain introduction was 0.9 per herd-year (95% confidence interval: 0.6-1.4). The rates for the most commonly introduced MDR Salmonella serovars were 0.4/herd-year for Typhimurium, 1.2/herd-year for Newport, and 0.1/herd-year for Dublin. Thirty-three of 59 herds (56%) had at least one new MDR Salmonella introduction during the study period. The number of new MDR Salmonella strains acquired by dairy herds ranged from zero to 8. Thirteen of the 59 herds had a history of clinical salmonellosis. Among these 13 herds, 6 herds acquired new MDR Salmonella strains, although these strains were different than historical clinical strains. These data indicate that acquisition of new MDR Salmonella strains by dairy herds was a common event in participating herds, although the number of strains introduced varied greatly among herds.
