Shigella sonnei resistant to cefotaxime (but not to ceftazidime) was isolated for the first time in stool samples from a pediatric patient with vomiting and bloody diarrhea in northern Argentina. Microbiologic and biochemical tests confirmed the presence of an extended spectrum beta-lactamase displaying an apparent isoelectric point value of 8.2.
