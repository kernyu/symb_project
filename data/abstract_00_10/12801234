A novel series of acylides, 3-O-(aryl)acetylerythromycin A derivatives, were synthesized and evaluated. These compounds have significant potent antibacterial activity against not only Gram-positive pathogens, including inducibly macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B))-resistant and efflux-resistant strains, but also Gram-negative pathogens, such as H. influenzae. 6,9:11,12-dicarbonate acylide 47 (FMA0122) was twice as active against H. influenzae than azithromycin, whereas it showed only moderate in vivo efficacy in mouse protection tests. However, the 11,12-carbamate acylide 19 (TEA0929), which showed potent antibacterial activity against almost all of the main causative pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia tested, exhibited excellent in vivo efficacy comparable to those of second-generation macrolides.
