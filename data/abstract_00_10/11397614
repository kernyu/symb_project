The antimicrobial activity of ABT-773, a novel ketolide, was tested against 618 Gram-positive strains collected from various surveillance programmes between 1997 and 2000. ABT-773 has potent activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, < or = 0.03-0.12 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC90, < or = 0.03 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (MIC90, < or = 0.03 mg/l), including erythromycin-resistant strains. In contrast, ABT-773 was less active against erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (31% susceptible at < or = 0.25 mg/l), coagulase-negative staphylococci (41% susceptible) and enterococci (30% susceptible). Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 4 mg/l) was less inhibited by the two ketolides tested, and ABT-773 was generally two- to fourfold more potent than telithromycin. The ketolides appear to have potential clinical use against some Gram-positive species resistant to macrolides.
