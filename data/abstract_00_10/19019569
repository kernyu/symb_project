The rates of antibiotic susceptibility and resistance were investigated in Streptococcus iniae and Streptococcus parauberis isolates obtained from diseased olive flounders (Paralichthys olivaceus) collected from fish farms in Jeju Island, Korea. Isolates of S. iniae (n=65) were susceptible to cefotaxime, erythromycin, ofloxacin, penicillin, tetracycline and vancomycin, as demonstrated by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test. Isolates of S. parauberis (n=86) were highly resistant to erythromycin (58% of the 86 isolates tested) and tetracycline (63% of the 86 isolates tested). Fifty-four isolates of tetracycline-resistant S. parauberis contained the tet(M/O/S) genes, of which 39 and 12 isolates contained the tet(M) and tet(S) genes, respectively, whereas 3 isolates contained both the tet(M) and tet(S) genes. Among the erythromycin-resistant isolates of S. parauberis (n=50) only 14 contained the erm(B) gene. These results suggest that the tet(S) and erm(B) genes of S. parauberis are involved in the acquisition of high-level resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline. Our findings reveal a high rate of antibiotic resistance among strains of S. parauberis and emphasize the need to develop an appropriate vaccine to reduce the use of antibiotics.
