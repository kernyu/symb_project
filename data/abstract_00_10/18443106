We present data from antimicrobial assays performed in vitro that pertain to the potential clinical utility of a novel rifamycin-quinolone hybrid antibiotic, CBR-2092, for the treatment of infections mediated by gram-positive cocci. The MIC(90)s for CBR-2092 against 300 clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci ranged from 0.008 to 0.5 mug/ml. Against Staphylococcus aureus, CBR-2092 exhibited prolonged postantibiotic effects (PAEs) and sub-MIC effects (SMEs), with values of 3.2, 6.5, and >8.5 h determined for the PAE (3x MIC), SME (0.12x MIC), and PAE-SME (3x MIC/0.12x MIC) periods, respectively. Studies of genetically defined mutants of S. aureus indicate that CBR-2092 is not a substrate for the NorA or MepA efflux pumps. In minimal bactericidal concentration and time-kill studies, CBR-2092 exhibited bactericidal activity against staphylococci that was retained against rifampin- or intermediate quinolone-resistant strains, with apparent paradoxical cidal characteristics against rifampin-resistant strains. In spontaneous resistance studies, CBR-2092 exhibited activity consistent with balanced contributions from its composite pharmacophores, with a mutant prevention concentration of 0.12 mug/ml and a resistance frequency of <10(-12) determined at 1 mug/ml in agar for S. aureus. Similarly, CBR-2092 suppressed the emergence of preexisting rifamycin resistance in time-kill studies undertaken at a high cell density. In studies of the intracellular killing of S. aureus, CBR-2092 exhibited prolonged bactericidal activity that was superior to the activities of moxifloxacin, rifampin, and a cocktail of moxifloxacin and rifampin. Overall, CBR-2092 exhibited promising activity in a range of antimicrobial assays performed in vitro that pertain to properties relevant to the effective treatment of serious infections mediated by gram-positive cocci.
