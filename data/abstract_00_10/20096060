Antiretroviral therapy has improved continuously. Almost every year a new drug has been approved. Nucleoside analogs still build the backbone of antiretroviral therapy. They inhibit reverse transcriptase and thus the transcription of RNA to DNA. They are combined with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibitors. New therapeutic approaches are attachment or entry inhibitors, integrase inhibitors and maturation inhibitors. Multiple prospective multicenter studies have proven the life prolonging effect of antiretroviral therapy. With the optimal therapy life expectancy of HIV patients is only slightly reduced, similar to that of those with chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus. One result of the higher age of HIV patients is an increase in concomitant diseases and medications. Drug interactions have to be considered and avoided. There has been a long discussion about the best time point to start antiretroviral therapy. In the late 1990s, every infected patient was treated hoping to eliminate the virus, ignoring the CD4+ cell count and viral load. This caused multiple (long-term) side effects and a rising resistance problem. The guidelines now recommend starting therapy at about 350/microl CD4 lymphocytes. Due to its complexity antiretroviral therapy should be initiated and monitored in specialized centers.
