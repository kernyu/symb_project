Little information is available on circulating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) subtypes and resistance to antiretroviral drugs in Albania. To fill this gap, we studied 72 plasma samples from HIV-infected individuals from throughout the country. Subtype classification and genotypic resistance analysis were performed on the HIV pol gene region. The analysis was successfully performed on 66 (91.6%) plasma samples and showed that 43 (65.2%) strains were non-B subtypes (mostly subtype A, as determined by analysis of pol gene sequences). No major mutations in the protease gene were found, whereas analysis of the reverse transcriptase gene revealed a few major mutations associated with resistance. In conclusion, non-B subtypes are predominant in Albania, and the prevalence of resistance to antiretroviral drugs is still low.
