The function of mutations rdn1A, rdn1T, and rdn2 in 18S rRNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is investigated. The mutations correspond to substitutions C1054A, C1054U in helix 34, and G517A in helix 18 of 16S rRNA in Escherichia coli, respectively, in which the first and third mutations caused nonsense suppression, while C1054U caused no suppression. In yeast, rdn1A caused phenotypic suppression at nonsense codons, whereas rdn1T and rdn2 caused antisuppression. We provide in vitro evidence that, in addition, rdn1A decreases translational accuracy at sense codons as well, by a factor of 8, accompanied by extreme sensitivity to paromomycin, compatible with its error-prone character. Mutations rdn1T andrdn2 exhibit hyperaccuracy and paromomycin resistance. Thus, mutations in conserved rRNA regions may affect the same functions in the various species but in opposite directions. Mutation rdn1A, but not rdn1T or rdn2, affected also the catalytic activity of the ribosome, a 60S subunit activity. The rate of peptide bond formation was reduced to half its normal value, indicating a communication between the two subunits. Moreover, error-prone mutation rdn1A was less susceptible to oxidative modifications than wild type, indicated by decreased lipid peroxidation and nonprotein/protein disulfides, as well as by increased protein thiols. In contrast, hyperaccurate mutations rdn1T and rdn2 displayed increased oxidative stress. Our results suggest that the cells may consume more energy to achieve hyperaccuracy leading to increased oxidative modifications.
