The acquisition of the erythromycin resistance by Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki improved yields of delta-endotoxins in sporulating cells ranging from 134 to 215%. Resistance to erythromycin decreased the final spore count by at least 50%. Consequently, erythromycin resistance is an efficient tool for the improvement of bioinsecticides yields with a high ratio of delta-endotoxins to spores.
