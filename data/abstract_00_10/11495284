Studies with 26 clones of L. donovani promastigotes derived from three different Indian isolates indicated that wild type parasites are mixture of stibanate sensitive and resistant cells. Both forms of the parasite were resistant to the drug. Infection with resistant parasites appears to be the primary reason of high rate of pentavalent antimony unresponsiveness among Indian kala-azar patients. It was observed that the resistant parasites originated as a result of irregular and often incomplete treatment of kala-azar patients with pentavalent antimonials.
