To search multi drug resistance modulators, acridones carrying hydroxyl amine substituent at N-10 and COOH/Cl at C-4 were investigated for their interactions with the three components of efflux pump viz. P-gp, ATP, and Mg(2+). Experimental and theoretical results indicated that the compounds with COOH group at C-4 interact with P-gp and Mg(2+) while other set of compounds with Cl at C-4 interact with ATP and Mg(2+). Spot assay and R6G influx/efflux assay of compound 3 using Candida albicans showed decrease in the fungal growth and efflux of R6G, respectively, in presence of compound 3 suggesting the suitability of this compound for MDR modulation.
