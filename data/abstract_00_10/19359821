Voriconazole is used for treating invasive Aspergillosis, Fusarium and Scedosporium infections as well as resistant candidiasis. It is referred to as a second generation triazole. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the concordance of the results of antifungal voriconazole susceptibility tests for yeast isolates, comparing the Sensititre YeastOne method, Atb Fungus 3 and Etest. In all, 138 yeast isolates (42 C. tropicalis, 36 C. glabrata, 14 C. albicans, 8 C. famata, 6 C. parapsilosis, 4 C. dubliniensis, 3 C. krusei, 3 C. lusitaniae, 2 C. zeylanoides, 20 Candida spp.) were tested for susceptibility to amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole , itraconazole and voriconazole with Atb Fungus 3 method. The concordance between the Sensititre YeastOne method, Atm Fungus 3 and Etest for voriconazole was high (90%).
