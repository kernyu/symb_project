Among 40 Escherichia coli urine isolates from renal transplant recipients (Galveston, TX, 2003 to 2005), sequence type ST131 (O25:H4) was highly prevalent (representing 35% of isolates overall and 60% of fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), virulent appearing, antimicrobial resistant (but extended-spectrum-cephalosporin susceptible), and associated with black race. Pulsotypes were diverse; some were linked to other locales. ST131 emerged significantly during the study period. These findings suggest that E. coli ST131 may constitute an important new multidrug-resistant threat to renal transplant recipients.
