Recent studies have revealed an important role for CTLA-4 as a negative regulator of T cell activation. In the present study, we evaluated the importance of CTLA-4 to the immune response against the intracellular protozoan, Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease. We observed that the expression of CTLA-4 in spleen cells from naive mice cultured in the presence of live trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi increases over time of exposure. Furthermore, spleen cells harvested from recently infected mice showed a significant increase in the expression of CTLA-4 when compared with spleen cells from noninfected mice. Blockage of CTLA-4 in vitro and/or in vivo did not restore the lymphoproliferative response decreased during the acute phase of infection, but it resulted in a significant increase of NO production in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the production of IFN-gamma in response to parasite Ags was significantly increased in spleen cells from anti-CTLA-4-treated infected mice when compared with the production found in cells from IgG-treated infected mice. CTLA-4 blockade in vivo also resulted in increased resistance to infection with the Y and Colombian strains of T. cruzi. Taken together these results indicate that CTLA-4 engagement is implicated in the modulation of the immune response against T. cruzi by acting in the mechanisms that control IFN-gamma and NO production during the acute phase of the infection.
