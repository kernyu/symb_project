Echinocandins have become the drug of choice in infections caused by Candida glabrata. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of caspofungin alone and in combination against C. glabrata. In vitro assays demonstrated that caspofungin alone showed excellent fungicidal activity against C. glabrata, including fluconazole-resistant strains. The combination of caspofungin and azole antifungals showed potential synergy against C. glabrata. Overall, caspofungin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity, alone and in combination, against strains of C. glabrata.
