Four general hospitals in Cyprus evaluated the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains in positive cultures of staphylococci among inpatients from September 1999 to March 2000. One hundred and ninety three (193) strains were isolated from cultures of respiratory secretions, skin and mucous membrane lesions, blood and urine. Of the S. aureus strains studied, 80 (41.45%) were MRSA and 113 (58.55%) were methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). More than 78.75% of the MRSA were resistant to erythromycin and 18.75% to gentamicin. Of the MSSA, 17.69% were resistant to erythromycin and 7.08% to gentamicin. None of the MRSA and MSSA strains showed reduced sensitivity to vancomycin.
