The guideline on the management of H. pylori was developed by the Japanese Society for Helicobacter Research in 2000, and new triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin is recommended. At first, we determined the eradication ratio and the frequency of adverse effects, considering difference of genetic polymorphism in metabolizing enzyme of PPI, CYP2C19. No significant difference was shown among the groups of different metabolizing activity in the two points of view. Next, resistance to antibiotics of H. pylori were determined in the eradication-failure cases and compared before and after the therapy. The result did not showed that strains newly acquired the resistance during the therapy. We emphasis that the new triple therapy can be performed without considering the genetic difference or antibacterial resistance until now and that we should examine how eradication is completely performed.
