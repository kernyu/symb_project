To investigate the activity of DW286, a new fluoronaphthyridone, the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, grlA and grlB genes in 64 Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates were analyzed and the MICs of DW286 and comparator quinolones determined. Double and triple mutants in gyrA and grlA were resistant to ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, trovafloxacin and gemifloxacin but susceptible to DW286 (MIC 0.25-0.5 mg/l). The fourth alteration, Ser85Pro of GyrA was required to make a strain resistant to DW286 (MIC 4-32 mg/l). For a strain with the mutations at GyrA Ser84Leu and GrlA Ser80Phe, the MBC of DW286 was two-fold higher than its corresponding MIC, in contrast to ciprofloxacin which was not bactericidal.
