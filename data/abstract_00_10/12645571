Kinetic analysis of ribosomal peptidyltransferase activity in a methanolic puromycin reaction with wild type and drug-resistant 23 S RNA mutants was used to probe the structural basis of catalysis and mechanism of resistance to antibiotics. 23 S RNA mutants G2032A and G2447A are resistant to oxazolidinones both in vitro and in vivo with the latter displaying a 5-fold increase in the value of Km for initiator tRNA and a 100-fold decrease in Vmax in puromycin reaction. Comparison of the Ki values for oxazolidinones, chloramphenicol, and sparsomycin revealed partial cross-resistance between oxazolidinones and chloramphenicol; no cross-resistance was observed with sparsomycin, a known inhibitor of the peptidyltransferase A-site. Inhibition of the mutants using a truncated CCA-Phe-X-Biotin fragment as a P-site substrate is similar to that observed with the intact initiator tRNA, indicating that the inhibition is substrate-independent and that the peptidyltransferase itself is the oxazolidinone target. Mapping of all known mutations that confer resistance to these drugs onto the spatial structure of the 50 S ribosomal subunit allows for docking of an oxazolidinone into a proposed binding pocket. The model suggests that oxazolidinones bind between the P- and A-loops, partially overlapping with the peptidyltransferase P-site. Thus, kinetic, mutagenesis, and structural data suggest that oxazolidinones interfere with initiator fMet-tRNA binding to the P-site of the ribosomal peptidyltransferase center.
