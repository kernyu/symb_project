Ceftriaxone is known to induce reversible precipitates in the gallbladders of adults and children. However, ceftriaxone-associated gallbladder pseudolithiasis in children is rarely reported in Taiwan. We report a case of 5-year-old boy with Salmonella gastroenteritis, who was treated with ceftriaxone due to multidrug resistance and severe course. Cholelithiasis developed five days after initiation of ceftriaxone therapy and completely resolved one month after the end of treatment. Pediatricians and radiologists must be aware of this complication to prevent anxiety and unnecessary cholecystectomy.
