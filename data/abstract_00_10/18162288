Enterococcal meningitis is a rare complication of neurosurgical procedures. We present a patient who developed vancomycin-resistant enterococcal ventriculitis - meningitis after a brain tumor resection and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, treated successfully with intrathecal streptomycin through bilateral cerebrospinal fluid drainage catheters in addition to systemic antibiotics. This is the first report of such treatment for this resistant organism.
