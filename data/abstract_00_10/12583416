A total of 51 Salmonella strains were isolated during the six month period of May 1998 till October 1998. Of these, 41 (80.3%) were Salmonella typhi, 5 (9.8%) Salmonella pararyphi A,2 (3.9%) Salmonella worthington and 1 (1.9%) Salmonella senftenberg. The prevalent phage and biotype of Salmonella typhi was E1 (75%) and type 1 (90.2%) respectively. The commonest pattern of multiple drug resistance in Salmonella typhi was ACCoT and 92.5% of these belonged to phage E1. Out of the five Salmonella paratyphi A, one belonged to phage type 1 and the others were untypable. Similarly both the strains of Salmonella typhimurium were untypable. Thus the predominant isolate was Salmonella typhi and the commonest phage and biotype were E1 and biotype1 respectively.
