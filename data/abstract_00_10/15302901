Numerous bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide potently induce type I interferons (IFNs); however, the contribution of this innate response to host defense against bacterial infection remains unclear. Although mice deficient in either IFN regulatory factor (IRF)3 or the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR)1 are highly susceptible to viral infection, we show that these mice exhibit a profound resistance to infection caused by the Gram-positive intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, this enhanced bacterial clearance is accompanied by a block in L. monocytogenes-induced splenic apoptosis in IRF3- and IFNAR1-deficient mice. Thus, our results highlight the disparate roles of type I IFNs during bacterial versus viral infections and stress the importance of proper IFN modulation in host defense.
