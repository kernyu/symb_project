It is difficult to treat intracellular infections because of the intrinsic resistance of the microorganism to most antibiotics. Moreover, these microorganisms can survive in phagocytic cells (macrophages and neutrophils). In this study, our aims were to encapsulate an antibiotic in liposomes, which will be phagocytized as well as the microorganisms in the phagocytic cell (because liposomes were prepared using lipids which have an antigenic activity and they can be phagocytized, thus, the active substance can be transferred into the cell), and to visualise with microscopy the phagocytic activity of macrophages and neutrophils to liposomes. MLV (multilamellar vesicles) fluorescein-labeled liposomes were prepared and incubated with isolated Kangal shepherd dog macrophages and neutrophils. The phagocytosis of liposomes by monocytes was visualized step by step under the microscope. Liposomes were also observed phagocytized after incubation with neutrophils. Enrofloxacin was chosen as a model drug. Neutrophils and macrophages were isolated from Kangal shepherd dogs and infected with Staphylococcus aureus, and their phagocytic activities (PA) and microbicidal activities (MA) were determined. PA and MA values were redetermined and compared when enrofloxacin formulations were used. Liposomal enrofloxacin was found to be more effective.
