The objective of the study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of orbifloxacin against Staphylococcus intermedius strains isolated in France from canine skin and ear infections. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of orbifloxacin against 240 field S. intermedius isolates (69 skin and 171 ear isolates) ranged from 0.016 to 8 mg l(-1), with MIC50 and MIC90 equal to 0.5 and 1 mg l(-1), respectively. Only one strain, a pyoderma isolate was resistant (MIC=8 mg l(-1)). Orbifloxacin was tested at different concentrations for killing rate against five isolates obtained from pyoderma cases and against a reference strain (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213). Orbifloxacin expressed a concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against the S. aureus reference strain, but a time-dependent bactericidal activity against S. intermedius. Orbifloxacin induced bactericidal effect against the S. intermedius strains tested with concentrations equal to or two times MIC.
