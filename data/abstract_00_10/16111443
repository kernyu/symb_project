This article will discuss how therapy adherence may have an impact on acute otitis media (AOM) outcomes. Although the relationship between therapy adherence and treatment failures in AOM has not been proved beyond question, many believe that adherence with antibiotic therapy plays a key role in patient outcomes. Poor adherence may contribute to treatment failures; treatment failures are known to result in poorer health outcomes, higher total costs of care, and an increased potential for bacterial resistance. As such, managed care organizations should consider strategies for achieving better patient adherence with antibiotic regimens for AOM.
