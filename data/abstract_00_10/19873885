Effect of plants treatment by salicylic acid on the water potential, ethylene emission, intensity of lipid peroxidation oxidation and enzymatic antioxidative activity in the leaves with contrasting drought-resistance of winter wheat cultivars was investigated. It is ascertain, that the treatment of plants by salicylic acid contributes to a decrease of water loss and intensity of lipid peroxidation, to an increase of ethylene synthesis and peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase activity in the winter wheat leaves under drought conditions.
