OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of Methicillin resistance Staphylococcus aureus infection in major cities of Pakistan. SETTING: Various laboratories of the country with one as the central Laboratory. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven hundred and ninety two consecutive clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were collected from 8 laboratories all over Pakistan i.e. Karachi, Peshawar, Lahore, Sukkhur, Islamabad, Quetta, and Mirpur, Azad Kashmir. Antibiotic sensitivity was done by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method and MIC of Vancomycin was determined by 'E' test. RESULTS: Forty two percent of the isolates were found to be Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) while no Vancomycin resistance was encountered. CONCLUSION: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are seen in the local population with frequencies varying between 2-61% highest incidence is seen in the major cities of the country. Fortunately no Vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus has been isolated from any of the major cities.
