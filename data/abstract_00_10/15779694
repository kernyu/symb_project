WHO experts believe that antimicrobial resistance is potentially containable, but the window of opportunity to control and eventually eliminate the most dangerous infectious diseases is closing. If we miss our opportunity, it may become very difficult and expensive--and in some cases impossible--to treat infectious diseases. WHO's global strategy to contain antimicrobial resistance requires a massive effort and an alliance among countries, governments, international organizations, drug manufacturers, and private and public health care sectors. If infectious diseases are fought wisely and widely by the international community, drug resistance can be controlled and lives saved.
