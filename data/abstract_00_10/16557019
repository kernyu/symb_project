Antiviral assay is used routinely for measuring the biological activity of interferon (IFN). However, the challenge viruses used in these assays are considered dangerous to the animal industry and pose a risk of human infection. For example, the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is an important exotic disease agent in domestic animals, and the sindbis virus provokes rash, arthralgia, and fever in humans. Therefore, biosafety needs to be considered when antiviral assays are performed. We chose Getah virus as a candidate challenge virus because it is less hazardous to animals and humans. Crystal violet staining 50% CPE inhibition antiviral assay of human IFN using Getah virus was studied. Antiviral assay using Getah virus and FL cells gave a higher titer of human IFN than did assay using VSV. The titer of human IFN alpha was almost the same as that given by standardized control samples. The titer of human IFN by antiviral assay using Getah virus on the sheet method (IFN reacted the sheeted FL cells) was higher than those of the simultaneous reaction method (IFN reacted the suspending FL cells before sheeted). We therefore consider the sheet method useful for detection of small amounts of IFN. Antiviral assay using Getah virus on MDBK cells gave a lower titer of human IFN alpha than did assay using VSV. However, the adjusting the number of MDBK cells and the titer of Getah virus to get the best condition for CPE appearance, gave similar results in the assays using Getah virus and VSV. We consider that Getah virus is a potentially useful challenge virus for antiviral assay of human IFN.
