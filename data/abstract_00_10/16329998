The overall process of antimicrobial drug discovery and development seems simple, to cure infectious disease by identifying suitable antibiotic drugs. However, this goal has been difficult to fulfill in recent years. Despite the promise of the high-throughput innovations sparked by the genomics revolution, discovery, and development of new antibiotics has lagged in recent years exacerbating the already serious problem of evolution of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, both new antimicrobials are desperately needed as are improvements to speed up or improve nearly all steps in the process of discovering novel antibiotics and bringing these to clinical use. Another product of the genomic revolution is the modeling of metabolism using computational methodologies. Genomic-scale networks of metabolic reactions based on stoichiometry, thermodynamics and other physico-chemical constraints that emulate microbial metabolism have been developed into valuable research tools in metabolic engineering and other fields. This constraint-based modeling is predictive in identifying critical reactions, metabolites, and genes in metabolism. This is extremely useful in determining and rationalizing cellular metabolic requirements. In turn, these methods can be used to predict potential metabolic targets for antimicrobial research especially if used to increase the confidence in prioritization of metabolic targets. The many different capacities of constraint-based modeling also enable prediction of cellular response to specific inhibitors such as antibiotics and this may, ultimately find a role in drug discovery and development. Herein, we describe the principles of metabolic modeling and how they might initially be applied to antimicrobial research.
