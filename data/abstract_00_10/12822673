In the last 2 decades, consumer demand for fresher, higher quality, and safer food has promoted research on nonthermal methods of food preservation for the inactivation of microorganisms and enzymes as an alternative to thermal processes. However, the high resistance of certain enzymes and microorganisms to nonthermal processes, especially bacterial spores, limit their application. To expand the use of nonthermal processes in the food industry, combinations of these technologies with traditional or emerging food preservation techniques are being studied. The use of nonthermal processes in combination with other preservation technologies presents a number of potential benefits to food preservation. The purpose of this article is to review some successful combinations of different nonthermal technologies, such as high hydrostatic pressure, ultrasound, pulsed electric fields, and irradiation, with traditional or emerging food preservation technologies.
