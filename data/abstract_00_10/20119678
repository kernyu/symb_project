BACKGROUND: Orthopedic surgical-site infection (SSI), mostly due to S. aureus, is recognized as a major adverse event. This research aims to verify the usefulness of surgical team decolonization in order to reduce the risk of surgical-site infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed swabs of both nares and oropharynx to identify S. aureus carriers among orthopedic team members who consented to cooperate with the study. Carriers were treated with local application of mupirocin ointment. RESULTS: Retrospective study of 1,000 consecutive patients operated before surgical team decolonization showed 6 per thousand SSIs. Of the 300 cases considered after decolonization, none developed SSI. CONCLUSIONS: Though we are aware that more data need to be collected, this work might be relevant for the introduction of a new preventive protocol.
