The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (ESC) and Klebsiella (KS) among consecutive non-urine isolates were evaluated. Twenty-four of 392 isolates produced ESBLs. Among these half were from respiratory sites and all were susceptible to meropenem. Pulse field-gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed 12 clonally distinct ESBLs and iso-electric focusing (IEF) revealed that most (83%) produced multiple enzymes.
