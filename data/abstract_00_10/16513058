Following the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a number of metabolic and morphologic alterations, known as HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS), have been increasingly common in HIV-infected patients being treated with this therapy. The use of protease inhibitors (PI), in particular, has been associated with insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia, but only infrequently with diabetic ketoacidosis. We report a case of diabetic ketoacidosis in an HIV-infected woman after 1(1/2) years of a PI-containing regimen, demonstrating reduced beta cell function and insulin resistance.
