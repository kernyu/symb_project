A total of 12 VanA-type vancomycin-resistant enterococci, consisting of 10 Enterococcus faecium isolates and two Enterococcus avium isolates, were examined in detail. The vancomycin resistance conjugative plasmids pHTalpha (65.9 kbp), pHTbeta (63.7 kbp), and pHTgamma (66.5 kbp) were isolated from each of three different E. faecium strains. The plasmids transferred highly efficiently between enterococcus strains during broth mating and were homologous with pMG1 (Gm(r); 65.1 kb).
