The Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) have a long tradition of infectious disease control in animal production. Special attention has also been paid to the use of antibiotics. This has resulted in a relatively low use of antibiotics and also relatively favourable status of antibiotic resistance. The current situation, interventions and achievements are summarised with special reference to Sweden which was probably the first country where stringent control and prudent use of antibiotics was put into practice. The use of antibiotics for growth-promoting purposes is highlighted.
