Thirty-eight Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7/H(-) strains isolated from human infections, cattle and foods in Brazil and in some other Latin American countries were compared with regard to several phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. The genetic relatedness of the strains was also determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Similar biochemical behaviour was identified, regardless of the origin and country of the strains. Most (89.5%) strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial agents tested, but resistance to at least one drug was observed among bovine strains. Although a diversity of stx genotypes was identified, most (77.8%) of the human strains harboured stx(2) or stx(2)stx(2c(2vha)), whereas stx(2c(2vha)) prevailed (64.2%) among strains isolated from cattle. stx(1) and stx(1)stx(2c(2vha)) were the genotypes identified less frequently, and occurred exclusively among strains isolated from food and cattle, respectively. Despite differences in the stx genotypes, all strains carried eae-gamma, efa1, ehx, iha, lpf(O157) and toxB sequences. Many closely related subgroups (more than 80% of similarity) were identified by PFGE, and the presence of a particular O157:H7 STEC clone more related to human infections in Brazil, as well as a common origin for some strains isolated from different sources and countries in Latin America can be suggested.
