IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most important pathogen that affects transplant recipients, by directly causing clinical disease and by indirectly reducing patient and allograft survival. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This review provides a brief overview of the direct and indirect effects of CMV disease and the traditional and newly described factors that increase the risk of disease after transplantation. Newly acquired data in the diagnostics, prevention and treatment of CMV infection are discussed, with emphasis on guidelines for management as recently endorsed by the American Society of Transplantation and the Transplantation Society. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The reader will gain up-to-date insights into the contemporary management of CMV after solid organ transplantation. Practical aspects of its diagnosis, prevention and treatment are discussed. Emerging concerns of late-onset CMV disease and antiviral resistance are also highlighted to emphasize the need to optimize CMV-prevention strategies. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Prevention of CMV disease is an important goal in the management of solid organ transplant recipients. The efficacy of CMV prevention should be measured not only by the significant reduction in CMV incidence but, as importantly, by the improvement in long-term allograft and patient survival.
