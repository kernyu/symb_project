Factor analysis was used to assess relationships in the minimum-inhibitory concentration among 17 antimicrobials tested on isolates of Escherichia coli isolated from 360 faecal samples obtained from feedlot cattle. Six factors were extracted using maximum-likelihood factor analysis. The factors were interpretable antimicrobial groupings based on class of antimicrobial and previously described associations. New-generation cephalosporins, older-generation beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides grouped separately as classes of antimicrobials on four of the six factors. One of the remaining factors was a grouping of antimicrobials that had been identified as being related in previous feedlot studies. The last factor was a grouping of three of the five antimicrobials that comprise the antimicrobials found in penta-resistant strains of Salmonella Typhimurium. The factor analysis described patterns in the MIC data that would not have been apparent if only antimicrobial-resistance data categorized as susceptible-resistance had been analysed.
