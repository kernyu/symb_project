Nucleoside analogues display significant anticancer or antiviral activity by interfering with DNA synthesis. However, there are some serious restrictions to their use, including their rapid metabolism and the induction of resistance. We have discovered that the linkage of nucleoside analogues to squalene leads to amphiphilic molecules that self-organize in water as nanoassemblies of 100-300 nm, irrespective of the nucleoside analogue used. The squalenoyl gemcitabine exhibited superior anticancer activity in vitro in human cancer cells and gemcitabine-resistant murine leukemia cells, and in vivo in experimental leukemia both after intravenous and oral administration. The squalenoylation of other antiretroviral nucleosides also led to more potent drugs when tested in primary cultures of HIV-infected lymphocytes. Thus, the squalenoylation is an original technology platform for generating more potent anticancer and antiviral nanomedicines.
