This study characterized class 1 integrons in Escherichia coli in Taiwan. The stability and changes in gene cassettes inserted into integrons were also evaluated. The study included 436 clinical strains of E. coli isolated in 2002. Class 1 integrons were characterized by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Genetic localization of class 1 integrons was determined by conjugal transfer and Southern hybridization. The results indicated that 64% of E. coli isolates carried class 1 integrons. Molecular analysis revealed that the class 1 integrons harbored 13 different antimicrobial resistance gene cassettes and two unknown gene cassettes; the predominant cassettes were aadA and dfrA. Novel gene cassettes first recovered from E. coli were aacA4 and linF. Cassette arrays orfD-aacA4-catB8 and aadA1-linF were also observed. Gene cassette dfrA12-orfF-aadA2 was stable. The class 1 integron and dfrA17-aadA5 gene cassette were located on the same transferable plasmids and were capable of transmission. Therefore, the increased drug resistance of clinical isolates may be explained by antibiotic selective pressure and widespread presence of integrons. Under antibiotic selective pressure, gene cassette-mediated resistance may not be easily lost. The potential role of integrons in the uptake and dissemination of resistance genes by plasmid between species of bacteria may decrease the therapeutic effectiveness of antibiotics.
