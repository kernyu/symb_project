The massive (mis)use of antibiotics to control infections in aquaculture has resulted in the development of resistant strains, which have rendered antibiotic treatments ineffective. Moreover, the horizontal transfer of resistance determinants to human pathogens and the presence of antibiotic residues in aquaculture products for human consumption constitute important threats to public health. Therefore, to make the aquaculture industry more sustainable, new strategies to control infections are urgently needed.
