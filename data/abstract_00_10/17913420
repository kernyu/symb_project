Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) has been rarely isolated in infections of the ear, nose and throat region in immunocompetent patients without cystic fibrosis. There is only one previous study in literature that reported BCC isolation in immunocompetent patients with sinonasal polyposis. We describe herein a rare case of multiresistant sinonasal infection by BCC in an immunocompetent patient with recurrent sinonasal polyposis. BCC seems to be a potentially emerging bacterial pathogen of sinonasal structures in patients with polyposis, also after FESS.
