BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates inhibit the activity of osteoclasts and demonstrate antitumor effect, involving induction of plasmocyte apoptosis, blocking of angiogenesis, stimulation of Tgd lymphocytes and inhibition of metalloproteinases. Bisphosphonates combined with thalidomide, a drug possessing confirmed anti-myeloma activity, seem to have potential favorable effect in patients with treatment-resistant multiple myeloma with advanced osteolytic lesions. MATERIAL/METHODS: 13 patients with treatment-resistant multiple myeloma with advanced osteolytic lesions received combined pamidronate and thalidomide therapy. All the patients underwent detailed clinical and laboratory control once a month. Pamidronate was used at 90 mg i.v. dose administered at 4-week intervals, and thalidomide at doses escalated from 200 mg/d in the first week to 400 mg/d after 3 weeks of the therapy. The mean duration of treatment was 12 weeks with a range of 3 to 36 weeks. RESULTS: 7 patients (53%) receiving pamidronate and thalidomide therapy demonstrated good response involving at least 25% reduction of monoclonal protein levels in comparison with baseline. All these patients reported improvement of osteodynia symptoms, and 3 of them - their complete regression. 70% patients experienced side effects (dizziness, constipation, somnolence, polyneuropathy) due to thalidomide administration CONCLUSIONS: Good response to combined pamidronate and thalidomide therapy can be expected in at least 50% of patients with treatment-resistant multiple myeloma with advanced osteolytic lesions.
