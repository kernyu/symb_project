Quinolone resistance of Chlamydia pneumoniae has not been described previously. Serial subcultures of C. pneumoniae under increasing moxifloxacin concentrations (0.0125 to 6.4 mg/liter) resulted in a 256-fold MIC increase compared to moxifloxacin-naive strains. GyrA gene sequencing revealed a novel point mutation with a Ser-->Asn substitution. Subcultures under rifalazil and macrolides did not alter the respective MICs.
