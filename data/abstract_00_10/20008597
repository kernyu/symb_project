QUESTION: Because of the recent outbreak of pandemic H1N1 2009, I am anticipating a large number of children with influenza-like symptoms or children diagnosed with influenza. Is oseltamivir effective and safe when used for children? ANSWER: Oseltamivir is effective for prevention of complications associated with influenza A (including H1N1) in children. Oseltamivir also reduces the duration of influenza by a median of 36 hours, with nausea and vomiting as the primary reported adverse effects. The World Health Organization recommends oseltamivir as first-line treatment for H1N1, with the use of zanamivir only for suspected or confirmed oseltamivir resistance. Recently, in preparation for the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic, Health Canada published an interim order permitting the expanded use of oseltamivir for treatment or prophylaxis for children younger than 1 year of age.
