Small strongyles (cyathostomes) that are resistant against anthelmintics have become a major problem in equine medicine in the recent years. In many European countries benzimidazole-resistant cyathostomes are widespread and are now present in well over 50% of equine populations investigated. In contrast, resistance against ivermectin has not been reported despite its widespread use in the recent years. Optimising the frequency of treatments based on quantitative faecal monitoring is of great importance to preserve remaining anthelmintic efficacy.
