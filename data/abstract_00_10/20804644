OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively investigate the risk factors, distribution, antibiotic resistance of infection with Gram-positive (G+) bacteria in an intensive care unit (ICU), so as to provide the reference for clinical prevention and treatment. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of clinical data of 83 patients with G+ bacteria infection in ICU from January 2003 to December 2008 was done. RESULTS: Of the 125 strains of G+ bacteria from 83 patients, Staphylococcus was the main organism (63.2%, 79/125). The prognosis of the patient was related with surgical operation (chi2=9.107, P=0.003), gastric intubation (chi2=4.053, P=0.044), complication (chi2 5.908, P=0.015) and the use of immunosuppressant (chi2=5.761, P=0.016). Multi-bacterial infection was related with surgery (chi2=8.847, P=0.003) and tracheostomy (chi2=10.445, P=0.001). The antibiotic susceptibility test in vitro showed that G+ bacteria displayed multi-resistance to antibiotics, but all of G+ bacteria were sensitive to vancomycin (resistance rate was 0). CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus was the most common pathogen of G+ bacterial infection in ICU. Further surveillance of bacterial resistance is warranted in ICU, and antimicrobial drugs should be used according to the result of susceptibility test. Taking account of the antibiotic resistance and risk factors of G+ bacteria infection in ICU, the infection could be controlled and the death rate could be cut down when appropriate measures are taken.
