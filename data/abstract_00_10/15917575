A narrow-spectrum clavulanic acid-inhibited class A beta-lactamase, BOR-1, was identified in a Bordetella bronchiseptica clinical isolate. It shared 45% amino acid identity with L-2 from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. An identical beta-lactamase gene was found in B. bronchiseptica and Bordetella parapertussis reference strains that may contribute only in part to their resistance phenotype.
