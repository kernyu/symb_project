Gastrodia antifungal proteins (GAFPs) are a group of mannose-binding lectins purified from Gastrodia elata that show strong resistance against a wide spectrum of fungi. The GAFP-2 promoter was analyzed for its ability to control the expression of the reporter gene, beta-glucuronidase (GUS) in transgenic tobacco plants. The GUS assays revealed that the GAFP-2 promoter is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, which mainly expressed in the vascular cells. The highest GUS activity was observed in roots, followed by stems. GAFP-2-GUS expression was strongly induced by the fungus Trichoderma viride and by the plant stress regulators, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid in the stably transformed tobacco plants. The -537 region of the GAFP-2 promoter was sufficient for its tissue-specific and inducible expression of the promoter.
