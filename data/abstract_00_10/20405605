Treatment is initiated when the McDonald criteria for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) are fulfilled. High-risk patients with clinically isolated syndrome are followed using magnetic resonance imaging for one year after the first imaging. Interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate are the first-line immunomodulating drugs (IMD) for RRMS. MxA protein is measured 12 and 24 months after initiation of Interferon-beta to evaluate possible development of neutralizing antibodies. If MxA protein may not be detected repeatedly interferon-beta treatment is discontinued. If the disease is active in spite of treatment with first-line IMD, natalizumab may be considered as a second-line therapy. IMD is stopped when the transition to secondary progressive phase has occurred (or upon transition to secondary progressive phase).
