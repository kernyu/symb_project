Three isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae highly resistant to multiple fluoroquinolones were isolated in Japan. Compared with susceptible strains of S. agalactiae, these quinolone-resistant strains had double point mutations within the quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA and parC; Ser-81 was changed to Leu (TCA --> TTA) in the amino acid sequence deduced from gyrA, and Ser-79 was changed to Phe (TCC --> TTC) in the amino acid sequence deduced from parC. Comparative sequence analysis revealed the possibility of gene transfer between S. agalactiae and another beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Streptococcus difficile.
