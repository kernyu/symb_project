Antimicrobial resistance to nine anti-pseudomonal agents (azteronam, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin and gentamicin), the magnitude of multidrug resistance, associated underlying conditions, and mortality among patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from 2001 to 2005 were determined. The results showed that antimicrobial resistance among P. aeruginosa is gradually increasing for most anti-pseudomonal agents, particularly aztreonam, ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. There were 19 (3%) and 12 (2%) multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa patients in 2004 and 2005, respectively, and MDR P. aeruginosa was more commonly found in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Most MDR isolates were from surgical and diabetic patients. The mortality rate was higher among ICU patients.
