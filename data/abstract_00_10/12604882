A 62-year-old woman was referred to hospital to be treated for complete heart block with syncope. A quadricuspid aortic valve without vegetation and aortic valve regurgitation (AR) were observed by transesophageal echocardiography. Blood culture showed penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient received a permanent pacemaker implantation (VDD type) and was given antibiotics. Although infection improved, heart failure was not improved because AR hemodynamic changes became worse. An aortic valve replacement was performed using a prosthesis on the 26th day of hospitalization. The patient recovered and was discharged.
