The goal of this study was to examine whether IL-6 could directly protect lung resident cells, especially alveolar epithelial cells, from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cell death. ROS induced IL-6 gene expression in organotypic lung slices of wild-type (WT) mice. ROS also induced IL-6 gene expression in mouse primary lung fibroblasts, dose dependently. The organotypic lung slices of WT were more resistant to ROS-induced DNA fragmentation than those of IL-6-deficient (IL-6-/-) mice. WT resistance against ROS was abrogated by treatment with anti-IL-6 antibody. TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling stain and electron microscopy revealed that DNA fragmented cells in the IL-6-/- slice included alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that IL-6 reduced ROS-induced A549 alveolar epithelial cell death. Together, these data suggest that IL-6 played an antioxidant role in the lung by protecting lung resident cells, especially alveolar epithelial cells, from ROS-induced cell death.
