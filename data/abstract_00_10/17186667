Although enterococci are considered opportunistic pathogens, they can be reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance is increasingly important because of foodborne illnesses from meat and infections from produce. From 2000 through 2001, food items (vegetables, fruits, and meats) were obtained from grocery store chains in northern Georgia and cultured for the presence of enterococci; 47.7% (189 of 396) of these samples were positive for enterococci. For the fruits and vegetables, enterococci were cultured most often from tomatoes (9 of 27 samples, 33%) and radishes (10 of 11 samples, 91%), respectively. Among the meat items tested, enterococci were isolated from 95% (21 of 22) of the chicken samples, 73% (16 of 22) of the beef samples, 95% (20 of 21) of the turkey samples, and 68% (15 of 22) of the pork samples. The predominant species identified was Enterococcus faecalis (n = 80) from meat and Enterococcus casseliflavus (n = 66) from fruits and vegetables. Although high numbers of isolates were resistant to lincomycin (176 of 185 isolates, 95.1%) and bacitracin (150 of 185 isolates, 81.1%), very few isolates were resistant to salinomycin (2 isolates, 1.1%), penicillin (3 isolates, 1.6%), or nitrofurantoin (9 isolates, 4.9%). None of the isolates were resistant to linezolid or vancomycin. These data suggest that foods commonly purchased from grocery stores are a source of enterococci; however, overall resistance to antimicrobials is relatively low.
