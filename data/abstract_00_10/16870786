(S)-9-[3-Hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine [(S)-HPMPA], is an effective broad-spectrum antiviral against many DNA viruses but has been reported to be inactive against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We synthesized several alkoxyalkyl esters of (S)-HPMPA and now report that hexadecyloxypropyl-(S)-HPMPA [HDP-(S)-HPMPA] and octadecyloxyethyl-(S)-HPMPA [ODE-(S)-HPMPA]had 50% effective concentrations of 0.4 to 7.0 nanomolar and were nearly fully active against HIV variants having reverse transcriptase mutations M184V and K103N and against a zidovudine-resistant variant with mutations D67N, K70R, T215Y, and K219Q. Resistance to HDP-(S)-HPMPA and ODE-(S)-HPMPA was noted for a mutant with mutation K65R. HDP-(S)-HPMPA is also active against herpes simplex virus type 1, human cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, adenoviruses, and orthopoxviruses and is worthy of further evaluation as a possibly therapy for HIV infection.
