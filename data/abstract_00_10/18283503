Acinetobacter spp. are increasingly reported as important causes of human infection. Many isolates exhibit multi-drug resistance, raising concerns over our ability to treat serious infections with these organisms. The impact of infection on clinical outcome as well as the importance of multi-drug resistance is poorly defined. A descriptive retrospective observational study was undertaken of all episodes of Acinetobacter bacteremia occurring in a UK tertiary care centre from 1998-2006. Demographics of infected patients, characteristics and antimicrobial susceptibility of infecting strains were recorded and the impact of antimicrobial therapy on all causes of 30-day mortality assessed. Three hundred ninety-nine episodes of Acinetobacter bacteremia were identified, with A. baumannii being the most frequently isolated species. Most episodes occurred in critical care and were associated with multidrug resistance, with carbapenem resistance rising from 0% in 1998 to 55% in 2006. Although bacteremia due to carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter and a requirement for critical care were associated with a higher mortality, mortality was not reduced by the administration of appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy. A prospective study is required to identify both the most effective intervention and those most likely to benefit from treatment.
