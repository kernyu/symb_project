The aim of the present work was to determine whether the luminescence-based reporter plasmid pQacLux could be applied to drug discovery in order to discard compounds with defined properties. Non-pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus RN4220 cells bearing pQacLux were incubated with different concentrations of a disinfectant of common use in hospitals. The in vivo light emission response of the plasmid to the given stimuli was then quantified and compared to a negative control for the construction of dose-response curves. The selected disinfectant provided a convenient model for the activity of quaternary ammonium compounds. In spite of the use of a raw model solution, the system revealed high levels of sensitivity. According to the results obtained, pQacLux could be conveniently used in the first steps of drug development in order to discard all possible multidrug resistance inducers.
