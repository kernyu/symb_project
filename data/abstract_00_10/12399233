BACKGROUND/AIMS: Alpha-interferon achieves persistent loss of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in about 30-40% of patients with chronic hepatitis B. In non-responder patients, the disease may progress leading to complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of beta-interferon in patients with chronic hepatitis B who did not respond to one course of alpha-interferon. METHODS: Twenty nine alpha-interferon-non-responder patients with chronic hepatitis B (11 hepatitis B e antigen, HBeAg-positive; 18 HBeAg-negative) were treated with 6 million units beta-interferon five times a week for 24 weeks. The post-treatment follow-up lasted for 48 weeks. RESULTS: At the end of treatment, 38% of patients (18% HBeAg-positive; 50% HBeAg-negative) had normal serum aminotransferase levels and negative serum HBV DNA. At the end of follow-up, HBV DNA was no longer detectable in serum in 21% of patients (18% HBeAg-positive; 22% HBeAg-negative). Beta-interferon was well tolerated and safe. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that beta-interferon therapy is effective and safe in the retreatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B who had not responded to a previous alpha-interferon cycle.
