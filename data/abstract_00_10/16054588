We studied the effect of doxorubicin on the production of hydrogen peroxide by PC3 human prostate cancer cells, using a sensitive assay based on aminotriazole-mediated inhibition of catalase. PC3 cells exposed to increasing concentrations of doxorubicin had an increase in intracellular hydrogen peroxide that was concentration-dependent up to 1 microM doxorubicin. The apparent hydrogen peroxide concentration in the PC3 cells was 13 +/- 4 pM under basal steady-state conditions and increased to 51 +/- 13 pM after exposure to 1 microM doxorubicin for 30 min. The level of hydrogen peroxide in the medium as measured by Amplex Red did not increase as a result of doxorubicin treatment. PC3 cells overexpressing catalase were no more resistant to doxorubicin cytotoxicity as compared to non-transduced wild-type cells; therefore, the exact role of hydrogen peroxide in anthracycline cytotoxicity remains unproven. This study demonstrates that a specific oxidative event associated with the exposure of PC3 human prostate cancer cells to anthracyclines results in an increase in intracellular hydrogen peroxide.
