A patient being treated for sickle cell crisis developed swollen, painful, indurated, discoloured thighs after several days in hospital. Imaging revealed the presence of multiple small abscesses in the muscle and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was cultured from aspirated fluid. Pyomyositis usually occurs in association with damaged muscle and impaired host defences. Staphylococcus is the most frequent organism involved. It is not a common complication of sickle cell disease, although it may be under diagnosed. Availability of advanced imaging techniques facilitates early diagnosis of pyomyositis.
