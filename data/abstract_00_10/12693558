To characterize the clinical features of bacteraemia due to tribe Proteeae, 132 cases among 130 patients from 1991 to 2000 were analysed. The organisms included the Proteus species in 63 cases (P. mirabilis in 41, P. penneri in 2 and P. vulgaris in 20), the Providencia species in 8 (P. rettgeri in 3 and P. stuartii 5) and Morganella morganii in 61. Morganella bacteraemia occurred more frequently in the hospital (70.5%). Biliary and hepatic diseases were predominant in cases with Morganella bacteraemia while cardiovascular, urological and neurological diseases were more common in cases with Proteus bacteraemia. Biliary drainage catheters had more frequently been placed in cases with Morganella bacteraemia (39.3%, p < 0.001), and urinary catheters more frequently in cases with Proteus bacteraemia (17.5%). Biliary infection was most common in cases with Morganella bacteraemia (49.2%), while urinary tract infection (UTI) was most common in cases with Proteus bacteraemia (47.6%). Mortality directly related to bacteraemia due to tribe Proteeae was 20.8% (22.6, 50.0 and 15.0% for Proteus, Providencia and Morganella bacteraemia, respectively). In conclusion, Morganella bacteraemia was most frequently associated with biliary infection, while Proteus bacteraemia was most frequently with UTI. Providencia bacteraemia was relatively uncommon and it can be associated with infections other than UTI.
