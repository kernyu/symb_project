In France, the overall proportion of penicillin-non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae has decreased from 53% in 2002 to 38% in 2006, and the proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from 33% in 2001 to 26% in 2007. Although the rates remain very high compared to Northern European countries, these trends suggest that the prevention efforts implemented since 2000 are successful.
