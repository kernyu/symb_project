Many tumors, including hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), resist Fas-mediated cell death, which is one of the effector mechanisms in the host's anti-tumor response; however, this resistance can be abolished by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). IFN-gamma may sensitize Fas-mediated cell death in several ways, but the exact mechanism in HCCs is uncertain. In this study, we thoroughly investigated the effect of IFN-gamma on the susceptibility of one human normal liver cell line and 12 HCC cell lines to Fas-mediated cell death. We also investigated the effect of IFN-gamma on the expression of various apoptosis-related genes such as the Fas/TNF-related genes, the bcl-2 family, and the caspase family of genes. Although most cell lines showed considerable constitutive expression of Fas, all tested cell lines resisted Fas-mediated cell death without IFN-gamma. When cells were pretreated with IFN-gamma, only three cell lines were made significantly susceptible to Fas-mediated cell death (SNU-354, SNU-387 and SNU-423); the other 10 cell lines were not affected. IFN-gamma increased the mRNA expression of Fas, TRAIL and caspase-1, and surface Fas was also increased. The strongly sensitized cell lines (SNU-354, SNU-387 and SNU-423) showed a particularly potent increment in surface Fas after IFN-gamma treatment (increase in surface Fas > 1.7-fold). This result enabled us to conclude that a potent increment of surface Fas expression is a major sensitizing mechanism of IFN-gamma. We conclude that IFN-gamma cannot play a sensitizing role in most HCC cell lines and that IFN-gamma makes HCC cells susceptible to Fas-mediated cell death through a marked up-regulation of surface Fas in some HCC cells.
