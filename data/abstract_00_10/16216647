The frequency of infections by Candida species is increasing worldwide, with candidemia representing the fourth most common bloodstream infection in the U.S. The risk of infection is especially high in the immunocompromised, hospitalized patient. The treatment of and prophylaxis for Candida infection have led to the emergence of resistant species and the acquisition of resistance in previously susceptible species. Current therapeutic options include amphotericin B and its lipid compounds, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin. Research is focusing on better diagnostics and the evaluation of strategies such as prophylaxis in high-risk hosts and pre-emptive therapy.
