The effect of some components of cultivation medium on the growth of the streptomycin-resistant Bacillus intermedius strain 3-19 and on the production of glutamyl endopeptidase was investigated using factorial experimental design, which allowed the concentrations of peptone and inorganic phosphate to be optimized for the maximum production of the enzyme. Experiments with different peptones and casamino acids showed that the enzyme production is maximum with peptone 3 of plant origin. The addition of casamino acids or amino acids to the peptone-containing cultivation medium inhibited the production of glutamyl endopeptidase.
