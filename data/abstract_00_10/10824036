This study compared the in vitro bacteriostatic activity of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and a panel of test antimicrobial agents against 100 clinical isolates of Acinetobacter spp. (47 Acinetobacter baumannii, 18 Acinetobacter anitratus, 18 Acinetobacter lwoffii, 13 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and four other Acinetobacter spp.). Gemifloxacin (MIC(50/90) 0.06/16 mg/L) was more than eight-fold more potent than ciprofloxacin (0.5/>128 mg/L), two- to eight-fold more potent than grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and gatifloxacin, and of similar potency to trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin. Cross-resistance was seen only within the quinolone group and did not extend to non-quinolone antimicrobials. The bactericidal activities of gemifloxacin and the six comparator quinolones were investigated by dose-response and time-kill studies against A. baumannii ATCC 19606 at their optimum bactericidal concentration (OBC) and at 4 x MIC. At the OBC there was no significant difference between the quinolones, but at 4 x MIC gemifloxacin showed superior activity, reducing the viable count by almost 2 log(10) in 30 min compared with a 1 log(10) reduction seen with the other drugs. This enhanced killing extended over 24 h, reducing cell numbers by >4 log(10). These data suggest that gemifloxacin has the potential to be of therapeutic value in the treatment of infection by Acinetobacter spp.
