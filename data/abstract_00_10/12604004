Ciprofloxacin resistance was analyzed in 354 Campylobacter jejuni isolates collected during two study periods (1995-1997 and 1998-2000) from travelers returning to Finland. The increase in resistance between the two periods was significant among all isolates (40% vs. 60%; p<0.01), as well as among those from Asia alone (45% vs. 72%; p<0.01).
