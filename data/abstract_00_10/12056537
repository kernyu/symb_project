Enteric coating of hard gelatin capsules by application of hydroalcoholic solutions of formaldehyde was studied and developed in accordance with previous publications. It is possible to affirm that this coating constitutes a simple, stable, reproducible, and inexpensive method, being a valid alternative to those which have been proposed. The aim of the present investigation is the preparation of acetylsalicylic acid gelatin capsules with good conditions of gastro-resistance and enteros solubility.
