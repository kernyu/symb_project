Stomatococcus mucilaginosus is a Gram-positive, catalase-variable organism considered part of the normal human oral and upper respiratory tract flora. Although traditionally believed to be an organism of low virulence, Stomatococcus mucilaginosus has been reported to be an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients. We describe what we believe is the first reported case of Stomatococcus mucilaginosus meningitis in a healthy child. The isolate was multidrug-resistant, susceptible only to vancomycin. The patient was treated successfully with vancomycin after initial trials with amikacin and cefotaxime.
