Phytochemical re-investigation of the aerial parts of Bonamia spectabilis (Convolvulaceae) led to the isolation of four minor tetrahydrofuran-type sesquilignans (bonaspectins E-H) together with the known neolignan virolongin A and the known lignan rel-(7S,8R,7'R,8'R)-3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexamethoxylignan. Their structures were established on the basis of spectral data. These six compounds as well as further seven lignanoids from B. spectabilis, characterised previously, were tested for their antiplasmodial activity against a chloroquine-sensitive strain (PoW) and a chloroquine-resistant clone (Dd2) of Plasmodium falciparum. Bonaspectin C 4"-O-glucoside, its aglycone, and bonaspectin D 4"-O-glucoside revealed the highest antiplasmodial activities (IC50 values: 1.3, 2.0, 6.5 microM [PoW]; 1.7, 4.6, 3.7 microM [Dd2], respectively).
