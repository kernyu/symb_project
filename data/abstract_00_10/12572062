OBJECTIVE: To examine the inhibitory effect of antisense nucleic acid on the in vitro translation of esterase mRNA from dipterex-resistant Culex pipiens pallens. METHODS: 18-mer nucleic acid was synthesized and complementary to the translation initiation site of mRNA of dipterex-resistant mosquitoes. The ODNs were annealed to the corresponding mRNA molecules and they were added to rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system. The translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After fixing, the gel was exposed to X-ray film by autoradiography for analysis of protein synthesis. RESULTS: Six mumol/L of ODNs elicited a 50% reduction in specific protein expression, and 20 mumol/L of ODNs inhibited the expression of esterase by 80%. The SDS-PAGE showed that the band of reduced amounts of 65 kDa protein for resistant mosquito was almost the same as that for sensitive sample. CONCLUSION: Antisense oligonucleic acids to the esterase mRNA of dipterex-resistant mosquito could effectively inhibit its in vitro translation.
