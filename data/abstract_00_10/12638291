The tolerance to penicillin of S. pyogenes has been mentioned in pharyngeal strains and associated by some authors with penicillin treatment failure in streptococcal angina. In this study we followed the presence of tolerance in S. pyogenes strains isolated from children hospitalized in the Clinic of Infantile Surgery and Clinic of Dermatology Iasi for skin infections. From 138 samples of pus examined we isolated 14 strains of S. pyogenes. In 7 strains we pointed out the tolerance to penicillin by both, beta-lactamase disc test and time-killing curve methods. We did not correlate to our cases the tolerance presence with penicillin treatment failure.
