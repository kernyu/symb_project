We studied the changes in antibiotic resistance of the most common Gram-negative bacteria isolated in the intensive care units at our hospital in 2000 and 2002. Bacterial identification was performed by use of the VITEK 60 analyser, and antibiotic susceptibilities were tested by the VITEK 60 analyser and the disk diffusion agar method. The bacteria isolated most frequently were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (132 strains in 2000 and 106 in 2002), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (98 and 109 strains, respectively) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (53 and 83 strains, respectively). Acinetobacters presented the highest percentage resistance, with significant increases in resistance to imipenem (15% in 2000 and 67% in 2002) and piperacillin/tazobactam (41% and 72%, respectively). P. aeruginosa presented a significant increase in resistance to all antibiotics, except ceftazidime. A large increase was observed in the resistance of K. pneumoniae to amikacin (from 10% to 50%), ceftazidime (from 80% to 90%) and tobramycin (from 80% to 90%). No imipenem-resistant strains of K. pneumoniae were found.
