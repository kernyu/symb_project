Streptogramin antibiotics are comprised of two distinct chemical components: the type A polyketides and the type B cyclic depsipeptides. Clinical resistance to the type B streptogramins can occur via enzymatic degradation catalyzed by the lyase Vgb or by target modification through the action of Erm ribosomal RNA methyltransferases. We have prepared through chemical and chemo-enzymatic approaches a series of chimeric antibiotics composed of elements of type B streptogramins and the membrane-active antibiotic tyrocidine that evade these resistance mechanisms. These new compounds show broad antibiotic activity against gram-positive bacteria including a number of important pathogens, and chimeras appear to function by a mechanism that is distinct from their parent antibiotics. These results allow for the development of a brand new class of antibiotics with the ability to evade type B streptogramin-resistance mechanisms.
