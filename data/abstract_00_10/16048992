High occurrence of the non-macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance genes msrA (53%) and linA/linA' (30%) was found among 98 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci additionally resistant to macrolides and/or lincosamides. The gene msrA predominated in Staphylococcus haemolyticus (43 of 62 isolates). In Staphylococcus epidermidis, it was present in 7 of 27 isolates. A novel mechanism of resistance to lincosamides appears to be present in 10 genetically related isolates of S. haemolyticus in the absence of ermA, ermC, msrA, and linA/linA'.
