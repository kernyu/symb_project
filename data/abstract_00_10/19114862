Gender-related differences in the efficacy and safety of ritonavir-boosted tipranavir [tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r) 500/200 mg twice daily (b.i.d.)] were evaluated in a subanalysis of the Randomized Evaluation of Strategic Intervention in Multidrug Resistant Patients with Tipranavir (RESIST) trials. Data from HIV-1-infected women (203; TPV/r = 117) and men (1280; TPV/r = 629) showed no significant gender-related differences in HIV RNA response rates (at 48 weeks) and safety (at 96 weeks) despite higher mean steady-state plasma TPV trough concentrations in women. Significantly greater increases in CD4 cell count (+81.2 vs. +48.6; P = 0.0012) were observed in women at week 48.
