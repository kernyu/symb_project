We report the case of a health care worker who received a post-exposure prophylaxis including an investigational drug, maraviroc, after a needle stick percutaneous injury to an HIV-infected patient with late-stage disease and harboring a multi-drug resistant virus. Post-exposure prophylaxis including maraviroc was pursued for a total of 28 days, with a weekly clinical and biological evaluation. Post-exposure prophylaxis was well tolerated, with no increase in liver function tests. The health care worker remained HIV-negative after a 6-month follow-up.
