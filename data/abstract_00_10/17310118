Novel retinoid derivatives containing a benzimidazole moiety were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial activity. Their antimicrobial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida krusei and Candida albicans were evaluated. While some of the compounds exhibited moderate activity against MRSA, S. aureus, E. faecalis, C. krusei and C. albicans, none of the compounds showed activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa.
