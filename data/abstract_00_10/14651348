Response of sugar beet cultivars C40 and USH11 to syringe infiltration of live and dead Bacillus mycoides isolate Bac J, a biological control agent, and virulent and avirulent isolates of Erwinia carotovora pv. betavasculorum was measured by monitoring systemic acquired resistance control of Cercospora beticola, specific activity of chitinase and beta-glucanase, the oxidative burst, and hypersensitive cell death at the infiltration site. Priming sugar beet with B. mycoides Bac J (1 x 10(8) cells/ml) and avirulent isolates of E. carotovora pv. betavasculorum (1 x 10(6) cells/ml) reduced C. beticola symptoms by nearly 70% on distal, untreated leaves. Systemic resistance responses elicited by live B. mycoides Bac J and avirulent E. carotovora pv. betavasculorum isolates, measured by assays for chitinase and beta-glucanase, were statistically equivalent, and biphasic hydrogen peroxide production was observed. Although similar in timing, the second hydrogen peroxide burst was twofold lower for B. mycoides Bac J than for avirulent E. carotovora pv. betavasculorum. Hypersensitive cell death was elicited by avirulent E. carotovora pv. betavasculorum but not B. mycoides Bac J. An oxidative burst was elicited by spray-applied B. mycoides Bac J under both light and green light conditions, indicating that the signal produced by B. mycoides Bac J was not reliant on the stomata for entry into sugar beet. A working model for signal delivery and systemic resistance induction by B. mycoides Bac J in sugar beet is proposed.
