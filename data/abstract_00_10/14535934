Nasal swabs of 293 calves were examined for Mycoplasma. The samples were collected from calves affected with respiratory diseases on 71 farms in various parts of Japan between 1996 and 1997. Mycoplasma bovirhinis was isolated from 47 of 293 calves (16.0%). Mycoplasma alkalescens, M. bovis, M. arginini, M. bovigenitalium and Acholeplasma spp. were isolated from 19 (6.5%), seven (2.4%), four (1.4%), four (1.4%) and 18 (6.1%) calves, respectively. Pasteurella multocida and P. haemolytica were isolated from 60% of Mycoplasma-positive calves. However, other bacteria were not isolated from calves. To evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility of their isolates, 68 M. bovirhinis, 21 M. alkalescens and 10 M. bovis strains were examined for 12 antimicrobial agents. All isolates showed higher susceptibility to tiamulin than to the other drugs used in the study. However, erythromycin had no effect on any of the Mycoplasma strains studied. The field isolates were less susceptible than the type strains to some drugs, such as spiramycin, oxytetracycline and tylosin.
