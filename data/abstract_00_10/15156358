Antimicrobial resistance patterns among the principal bacterial pathogens from infections of the respiratory tract, blood, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract of pediatric patients from the USA, Canada, Germany, France, and Italy were studied using the The Surveillance Network (TSN) database. Among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from respiratory tract infections, the prevalence of high-level penicillin resistance (MIC>/=2 microg/ml) ranged from 1.1 (Italy) to 36.2% (USA); erythromycin resistance was higher, ranging from 13.4 (Germany) to 63.8% (France). The prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae among isolates from lower respiratory tract infections ranged from <10 (Italy and Germany) to 38.4% (USA). Among isolates from blood and skin and soft tissue infections, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ranged from 7.2% (Canada and Germany) to 27.3% (Italy). The prevalence of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae with putative extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among isolates from blood, urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue infections ranged from 0 (Germany and France) to 29.6% (Italy). With the exception of pseudomonal infections or infections with MRSA, amoxicillin-clavulanate retained moderate activity, whilst ceftriaxone and cefepime were the most effective broad-spectrum injectable agents. Meropenem was the most effective agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with <5% resistance. Low levels of resistance, along with acceptable safety profiles and the availability of convenient oral formulations, continue to support the use of ceftriaxone, cefepime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and meropenem as viable options for the treatment of infections in pediatric patients.
