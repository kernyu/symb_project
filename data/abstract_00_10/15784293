In vivo studies were carried out to investigate the protective effect of the interferon inducer poly I:C against channel catfish virus (CCV). Channel catfish were stimulated by intraperitoneal injection of 50 microg of poly I:C or PBS at various days prior to immersion challenge with CCV. Mortality in the poly I:C group was significantly reduced from 70% to 3% at day 1 compared to the PBS controls. Mortality increased at day 3 but was still significantly different from the PBS controls. Mx1 transcription was significantly higher only at day 1. In an additional study Mx1 transcription was monitored in the liver, kidney, gills, spleen, and intestine at various time points post-stimulation with either poly I:C or CCV. Mx1 mRNA was significantly elevated in all organs only at day 1 post-injection with poly I:C. In response to CCV, Mx1 transcription was not significantly elevated until day 3 post-challenge, but remained elevated in certain organs until day 7.
