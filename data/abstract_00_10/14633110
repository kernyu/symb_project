AIMS: To examine factors affecting faecal shedding of the foodborne pathogens Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella in dairy cattle and evaluate antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained in replicate from lactating (LAC; n = 60) and non-lactating (NLAC; n = 60) Holstein cattle to determine influence of heat stress, parity, lactation status (LAC vs NLAC) and stage of lactation [</=60 or >60 days in milk (DIM)] and cultured for E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella. A portion of the recovered isolates were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility using the broth microdilution technique. RESULTS: No effects of heat stress were observed. Lactating cows shed more (P < 0.01) E. coli O157:H7 than NLAC cows (43% vs 32%, respectively). Multiparous LAC cows tended to shed more (P = 0.06) Salmonella than primiparous LAC cows (39% vs 27%, respectively). Parity did not influence (P > 0.10) bacterial shedding in NLAC cows. Cows </=60 DIM shed more (P < 0.05) Salmonella than cows >60 DIM. Seventeen Salmonella serotypes were identified with the most prevalent being Senftenberg (18%), Newport (17%) and Anatum (15%). Seventy-nine of the Salmonella isolates were resistant to at least one of the seven antibiotics. Escherichia coli O157:H7 isolates were resistant to 11 different antibiotics with multiple resistance to nine or more antibiotics observed in five isolates. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrated differences in the shedding patterns of foodborne pathogens due to the stage of the milk production cycle and may help identify times when on-farm pathogen control would be the most effective.
