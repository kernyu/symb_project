The relationship between the problem of antimicrobial resistance and efforts to control antimicrobial costs is explored. Antimicrobial drug management typically centers around controlling costs and controlling antimicrobial resistance. Selection of therapeutic alternatives without adherence to a well-developed program or without a rationale based on data from the medical literature may promote antimicrobial resistance. Attempts to select alternatives can produce cost shifting rather than cost containment. The annual cost associated with antimicrobial resistance in the United States is estimated to be as high as $47 billion. In one study, patients with bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus had an average length of stay 2.7 days longer than patients with susceptible strains and a mean cost of care that was $3500 higher. Infection control is one of the most important duties of health care practitioners. Given today's prevailing reimbursement structure, hospitals with high rates of nosocomial and resistant infections are likely to lose money. A basic problem with the current approach to controlling resistance is that the two most common strategies, highly restrictive formularies and drug cycling, work in opposition. Antimicrobial management programs should be directed at ensuring the most appropriate use of antimicrobials rather than focusing on limiting choices.
