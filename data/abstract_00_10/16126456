Mathematical models require a fine balance between biological detail and mathematical tractability. Models can now accommodate much more biological complexity but, nevertheless, they focus on elucidation of principles rather than exact predictions. In this article, I discuss the advances made in population modelling of nematode parasites since the first issues of Parasitology Today.
