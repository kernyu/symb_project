Seven high-level macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes isolates had reduced activity to telithromycin but were negative for methylation and efflux genes. All were of the constitutive phenotype, were clonally related (emm type 12 and MLST type 36), and had identical dual mutations (A2058G and U2166C) in domain V of 23S rRNA.
