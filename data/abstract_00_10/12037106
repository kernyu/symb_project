A bloodstream infection due to Candida haemulonii afflicting a patient with fever and a medical history of megaloblastic anemia is reported. The clinical isolate was misidentified by the API 20C and VITEK identification systems. The results of susceptibility tests showed that the MIC of amphotericin B for C. haemulonii was 4 microg/ml. Additional susceptibility testing procedures based on the use of antibiotic medium 3 and Iso-Sensitest broth were performed, and killing curves were determined. Two collection strains of C. haemulonii were employed as controls. The three isolates exhibited resistance to amphotericin B in vitro regardless of the antifungal susceptibility testing method employed. In addition, the MICs of fluconazole for the three isolates were high. Further studies are needed in order to ascertain whether this species exhibits innate or acquired resistance to amphotericin B and other antifungal agents.
