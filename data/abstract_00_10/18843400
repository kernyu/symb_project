Recently, we designed a series of novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors incorporating a stereochemically defined bicyclic fused cyclopentyl (Cp-THF) urethane as the high affinity P2-ligand. Inhibitor with this P2-ligand has shown very impressive potency against multi-drug-resistant clinical isolates. Based upon the -bound HIV-1 protease X-ray structure, we have now designed and synthesized a number of meso-bicyclic ligands which can conceivably interact similarly to the Cp-THF ligand. The design of meso-ligands is quite attractive as they do not contain any stereocenters. Inhibitors incorporating urethanes of bicyclic-1,3-dioxolane and bicyclic-1,4-dioxane have shown potent enzyme inhibitory and antiviral activities. Inhibitor (K(i) = 0.11 nM; IC(50) = 3.8 nM) displayed very potent antiviral activity in this series. While inhibitor showed comparable enzyme inhibitory activity (K(i) = 0.18 nM) its antiviral activity (IC(50) = 170 nM) was significantly weaker than inhibitor . Inhibitor maintained an antiviral potency against a series of multi-drug resistant clinical isolates comparable to amprenavir. A protein-ligand X-ray structure of -bound HIV-1 protease revealed a number of key hydrogen bonding interactions at the S2-subsite. We have created an active model of inhibitor based upon this X-ray structure.
