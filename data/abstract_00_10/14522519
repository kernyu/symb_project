A contemporary collection of 12,295 North American isolates (2001-2002) consisting of Staphylococcus aureus (50%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (12%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (24%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (12%), and viridans-group streptococci (2%) were tested against broad-spectrum beta-lactams (cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam) and comparator agents using a reference broth microdilution method to determine their continued effectiveness for empiric antimicrobial therapy. All isolates were very susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin (>98%). Oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci were also highly susceptible to the tested beta-lactams (>98%) with the exception of ceftazidime (93%). beta-hemolytic streptococci were exquisitely susceptible (>99%) to penicillin and all other agents except for clindamycin (94%) and erythromycin (81%). Viridans group streptococci were routinely less susceptible than were other streptococci. S. pneumoniae remained susceptible to most agents (>91%) with the exceptions of erythromycin (74%) and penicillin (69%). Among beta-lactams tested against S. pneumoniae, ceftriaxone and cefepime continued to be very active against penicillin-susceptible (>99%) and intermediate (>98%) strains, but less active (80% and 82%, respectively) against penicillin-resistant isolates. These findings confirm that the newer cephalosporins (cefepime and ceftriaxone) among broad-spectrum beta-lactam agents have a spectrum of activity that remains comprehensive for the commonly isolated Gram-positive pathogens.
