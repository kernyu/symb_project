In vitro resistance to 8 antimicrobials among enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli from piglets and calves over a 13-year period was evaluated. Least resistance occurred against ceftiofur for all, followed by apramycin and gentamicin for porcine and florfenicol for bovine isolates. No significant differences were found between the first 8 and last 5 years.
