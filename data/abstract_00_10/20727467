We investigated emergence of linezolid resistance among coagulase-negative staphylococci at our tertiary care center in 2007. All 17 cases were healthcare associated, and prior administration of linezolid was documented <or=2 months before first isolation of linezolid-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci for all but 1 patient. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis analysis of the 14 available strains demonstrated 1 predominant clonal type, suggesting nosocomial spread. In addition to mutations in 23S rRNA and L4 previously described, we observed novel alterations in the 23S rRNA gene (G(2215)A) and in the L3 protein (substitutions L(101)V, H(146)Q/R, F(147)I, V(154)L, M(156)T). The increase in linezolid-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci correlated with nosocomial transmission of selected mutated strains in patients who had received linezolid.
