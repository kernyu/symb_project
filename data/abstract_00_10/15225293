Bacterial DNA containing immunostimulatory motifs (CpG) induces the development of a T(H1) immune response. Since protection against Toxoplasma gondii is correlated with this type of response, the aim of this work was to determine if a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) containing CpG sequences could be useful as adjuvant for the induction of a long-lasting protective immune response against T. gondii. BALB/c mice immunized with a total soluble antigen of T. gondii (TSA2) mixed with ODN-containing CpG sequences developed a typical TH1 response, as determined by antibody isotypes and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) production by spleen cells. However, they did not resist a challenge with the virulent RH strain of the parasite. Absence of protection paralleled with lower levels of IFN-gamma, when compared with mice vaccinated with the live tachyzoites of the attenuated ts.4 strain of the parasite, which resisted this challenge. Intraperitoneal injection of ODN alone to mice induced a high degree of resistance to a lethal challenge inoculated by the same route. Nevertheless, this nonspecific protection was transient. Thus, the use of ODN containing CpG motifs as adjuvant is of limited value for the induction of a protective immune response against T. gondii.
