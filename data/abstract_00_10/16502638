The incidence of candidemia has increased approximately 500% in high-complexity hospitals. A change in the spectrum of Candida infections due to species other than Candida albicans has also been detected. Between April 1999 and April 2000 a multicenter study was performed in order to determine the species distribution associated to candidemias in Argentina and the susceptibility profile of the isolates to the current antifungal drugs. Thirty six institutions have participated. All the 265 yeast strains isolated from blood cultures were identified by morphological, physiological, and biochemical tests. The antifungal susceptibility testing of isolates was performed based on the reference NCCLS procedure. The distribution of species was: Candida albicans (40.75%), Candida parapsilosis (28.67%), Candida tropicalis (15.84%), Candida famata (3.77%), Cryptococcus neoformans (3.77%), Candida glabrata (2.64%), and others (4.53%). Most of the isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole. Mortality associated to the fungemia by yeasts episodes (n=265) was 30%, lower than results previously determined (33-54%). The mortality percentage in patients who received antifungal therapy versus patients without treatment was 26.3% and 47%, respectively.
