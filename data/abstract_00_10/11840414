Single-agent gemcitabine has been examined in several phase II trials in platinum- and paclitaxel-resistant advanced ovarian cancer. In this population, where patients are often heavily pretreated prior to the administration of gemcitabine, an acceptable dose and schedule is 800 to 1,000 mg/m(2) weekly for 3 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest. The anticipated objective response rate in the platinum/taxane-resistant population is approximately 15%. This level of activity (confirmed in several phase II trials), and the generally favorable toxicity profile for gemcitabine in this group of patients, leads to the conclusion that single-agent gemcitabine is a reasonable second-line treatment option in previously treated women with advanced ovarian cancer.
