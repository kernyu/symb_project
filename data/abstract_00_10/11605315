In addition to a rise in the number of cases of gonorrhoea, the susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to antibiotics is also a cause for concern. After a period of high resistance rates to penicillin and tetracycline between 1985 and 1995, resistance rates have dropped considerably in recent years, probably due to changes in treatment regimens. However, recently we have seen an increasing number of quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolates in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, a development that has previously been reported in other parts of the world. Some form of national resistance monitoring for gonococci is therefore urgently required to allow timely detection of changes in N. gonorrhoeae resistance.
