Vancomycin is used increasingly to treat invasive infections caused by multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although no vancomycin-resistant strains have been isolated to date, tolerant strains that fail to die rapidly and that cause relapsing disease have been described. The vex123-pep27-vncRS locus, consisting of an ABC transporter, a presumed signaling peptide, and a two-component system, respectively, has been implicated in vancomycin tolerance. Recent findings, however, challenged this model. The data presented here indicate that erythromycin in the growth medium induces a vancomycin-tolerant phenotype and that loss of function of Pep27 or VncRS does not alter autolysis. However, a role for the ABC transporter encoded by the vex123 genes in tolerance was confirmed. A vex3 mutant was considerably more tolerant to vancomycin treatment than the wild-type strain T4, and the strength of the phenotype depended on the orientation of the resistance cassette used to construct the mutant. Microarray results suggested a number of genes that might be involved in tolerance in the vex3 mutant. Although the exact function and regulation of the vex123-pep27-vncRS locus remains to be determined, several factors influence the autolysis behavior of S. pneumoniae, including the bacterial capsule, erythromycin, and the lytA and vex3 gene products.
