The opportunistic protozoan Cryptosporidium parvum is highly resistant to disinfectants, including those specifically used for processing reused medical equipment in hospitals. C. parvum oocysts were dried onto glass and steel grooved penicylinders and challenged with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution in the presence of 3 types of soil with exposures at 10 min, 90 min, and 10 h. The influence of organic soils on disinfection was measured with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% FBS, and 5 mg mucin/mL. An in vitro excystation procedure and cell culture infection assay were used to determine survivability of oocysts after the germicide challenge. In the presence of organic soil, all oocysts removed from carriers excysted and infected cell monolayers after all germicide contact times. However, excystation was observed only from oocysts that received no protection from organic soil after 10 h exposure. In these samples, no infection was observed in the cell monolayers. The results of this research demonstrate the importance of thorough cleaning of medical equipment before disinfection.
