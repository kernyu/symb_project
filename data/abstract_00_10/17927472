The use of antimicrobial agents in food animals can select for resistant bacterial pathogens that may be transmitted to humans via the commercial meat supply. In the USA, the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine regulatory duties require a determination that antimicrobial drugs are safe and effective for use in food animals. In addition, a qualitative assessment of risks to human health from antimicrobial resistance requires development. This risk assessment process is supported by data generated by the FDA's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) for enteric bacteria. NARMS data on antimicrobial susceptibility among Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus is collected. Research activities defining the genetic bases of resistance helps to understand the potential public health risks posed by the spread of antimicrobial resistance from food animal antimicrobial use. These activities help insure that antimicrobials are used judiciously to promote human and animal health.
