This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 364 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates and studied the genotypes of S. pneumoniae with high level beta-lactam resistance in Taiwan. Clonal complexes related to Spain(23F)-1, Taiwan(19F)-14, and Taiwan(23F)-15 were responsible for the spread of isolates with high beta-lactam resistance.
