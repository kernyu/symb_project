The spermatozoon is a highly specified cell that has the abilities of active motility and fertilization of the ovum. Damage to the sperm plasma membrane results in the irreversible loss of its functions. Because of the high content of unsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane, mammalian sperm are sensitive to oxidative stress. While mild peroxidation appears to promote capacitation of the sperm cell, excessive peroxidation will damage the plasma membrane and results in loss of motility and fertility. The functional integrity of the sperm plasma membrane can be determined by functional tests (determination of motility, resistance against hypoosmotic media) or different staining methods. Today, fluorescent dyes that allow the evaluation of membrane-intact cells are preferred. Computer-assisted evaluation or the use of flow cytometry has improved the precision of these methods. The use of cooled-shipped semen has become a routine method in the equine industry and semen stored at 5 degrees C for about 24 h maintains fertility close to that of fresh semen. According to the suitability of their ejaculates for cooled-storage, stallions may be classified as "good coolers" or "poor coolers". Semen processing involves a number of factors that may damage the sperm plasma membrane. This includes addition of semen extender, centrifugation, cooling and storage at a temperature of 4-6 degrees C. Extender media and their ingredients protect the sperm plasma membrane against environmental influences, but unsuitable composition of the extender can also promote membrane damage. Recent advantages in extender composition are based on the substitution of undefined factors such as milk or egg yolk by more defined and stable components.
