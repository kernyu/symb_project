Risk factors, mortality and antimicrobial susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremias isolated from 148 patients from all University Hospitals in Slovakia were analyzed. Only 1.2% of 169 strains of P. aeruginosa were resistant to meropenem, 4.1% to piperacillin/tazobactam, 7.7% to ceftazidime as well as cefepime and 12% to amikacin. More than 30% of P. aeruginosa were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Our analysis of risk factors for antimicrobial resistance to the particular antimicrobials, indicated no difference in risk factors and outcome in cases infected with P. aeruginosa bacteremias resistant to amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam or ceftazidime in comparison to episodes caused by P. aeruginosa due to susceptible isolates. When comparing risk factors for P. aeruginosa bacteremia in children vs. adults, cancer vs. non-cancer patients, several differences in risk factors were observed. Neither antimicrobial resistance to amikacin, ceftazidime or piperacillin/tazobactam, nor appropriateness of therapy according to two separate analyses were associated with better outcome.
