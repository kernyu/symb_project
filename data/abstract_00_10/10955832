The antibacterial pattern of tetracycline and bactrim was compared with that of the chloroform extract of two Pseudomonas strains using ten hospital strains each of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. There was no perfect correlation between isolate source, antibiotic type and sensitivity. Both the synthetic and natural antibiotic agent exhibited antibacterial activities against resistant hospital isolates at high concentrations.
