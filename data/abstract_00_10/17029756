An investigation into changes in the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella enterica serotypes Enteritidis and Typhimurium from human infection in England and Wales in 2000, 2002 and 2004 has shown that the incidence of strains of S. Enteritidis with resistance to nalidixic acid coupled with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin has more than doubled between 2000 and 2004, whereas the overall levels of resistance in S. Typhimurium have fallen by ca. 25%. In relation to published data on veterinary sales of antimicrobials in the UK, the findings demonstrate that changes in the incidence of resistance do not correlate with changes in veterinary usage. For S. Enteritidis, important factors in the increased incidence of resistance were foreign travel and the consumption of imported foods contaminated with drug-resistant strains. For S. Typhimurium, the most important factor has been an overall decline in the occurrence of multiple drug-resistant S. Typhimurium definitive phage type 104. These studies have demonstrated that changes in the incidence of resistance in predominant salmonellas in humans in England and Wales from 2000 to 2004 are multifactorial. The findings also demonstrate that, in order to combat drug resistance in zoonotic salmonellas causing infections in humans, controls on the use of antibiotics in food animals analogous to those in operation in the UK should be implemented in countries that regularly import food into the UK.
