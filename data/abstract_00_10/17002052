To evaluate the efficiency of chemotherapy used in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis by the results of a rapid detection of drug resistance (DR) to isoniazid and rifampicin on a "TB-Biochip" test system versus the standard treatment with its subsequent correction by the data of determination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) resistance by the absolute concentration technique (ACT), the study included 208 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 1) those in whom MBT sensitivity to antituberculous agents was determined on a "TB-Biochip" test system to detect mutations in the MBT genes rpoB, katG, inhA, ahpC that were responsible for MBT sensitivity to rifampicin and isoniazid and by ACT; 2) those in whom this was determined by only ACT. The results of a test for MBT sensitivity to rifampicin and isoniazid were obtained within 2 days before chemotherapy in Group 1 and 2 months after chemotherapy in Group 2. In Group 1, antituberculous chemotherapy was used, by taking into account MBT sensitivity to isoniazid, rifampicin, or their combination; in Group 2, the drugs were given by the standard regimens with their subsequent correction following 2 months by the results of ACT. The timely initiation of treatment with reserve drugs in the detection of drug sensitivity in MBT could achieve higher therapeutic efficiency and in a shorter space of time.
