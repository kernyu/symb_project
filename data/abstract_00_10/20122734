Over-expression of multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins PGP and BCRP has a negative prognostic impact in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Inclusion of fludarabine in induction chemotherapy increases remission rate in PGP over-expressing cases. We investigated the role of BCRP in 138 adult AML patients receiving induction therapy with fludarabine. None of the MDR-related proteins influenced complete remission attainment. Conversely, high levels of BCRP significantly affected disease-free survival, as higher relapse rates (48.5% vs 28.5%) and earlier relapse occurred in BCRP+ patients. Also overall survival was affected by BCRP positivity, and survival significantly worsened in case of concomitant PGP and BCRP over-expression.
