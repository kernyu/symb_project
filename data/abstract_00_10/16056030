Molecular diagnostic strategies have been implemented to enhance the treatment of musculoskeletal infections. Once primarily a research tool, molecular-based assays, have become accepted clinical tests for the genomic detection of certain pathogens involved in bone and joint infections. Currently, culture remains the gold standard for identifying most organisms causing infection. However, molecular assays are beneficial in clinical cases in which standard culture-based tests are unreliable or untimely. We will review current clinical utility of this emerging technology and roles for assays in the future.
