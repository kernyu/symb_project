The "Slidex MRSA Detection" test (Denka Seiken, Japan) is a latex agglutination assay able to detect PBP2a. We evaluated its ability to differentiate mecA-positive from mecA-negative coagulase-negative staphylococci. We included 100 coagulase-negative staphylococci clinical isolates belonging to 9 species, 54 mecA positive and 46 mecA negative, as characterized by PCR. The specificity achieved using the manufacturer's instructions was 100%, but the sensitivity was only 57%. To increase sensitivity, we introduced modifications into the standard protocol. Using either large inocula or oxacillin induction before test performance, we achieved 100% sensitivity.
