The decline in mortality resulting from the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been accompanied by an increase in metabolic complications that produce accelerated atherosclerosis. Hypertension is one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors. Little is known about the impact of HAART on blood pressure, and it is uncertain whether chronic HIV infection or HAART have a role in the development of hypertension. In this study, the research on the relationships between hypertension and HIV infection published to date is reviewed. Antiretroviral therapy appears to have a modest impact on blood pressure and to be partially mediated by the metabolic changes occurring with this treatment.
