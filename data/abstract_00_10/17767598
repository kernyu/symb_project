Rhinosinusitis is a common children's disease. Most cases are acute, follow an episode of common cold, and are the consequence of a superimposed bacterial infection. If mild, they are characterized by the persistence of signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease for more than 10 days; if severe, they involve fever and a purulent nasal discharge, and can cause a substantial decline in general health. Recurrent acute or chronic cases are usually diagnosed in children with predisposing factors, such as recurrent respiratory tract infections, allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency, ciliary dyskinesia, anatomic abnormalities or reflux. Therapy is based on antibiotics, administered orally in mild, and intravenously in severe cases. On the basis of recently highlighted antibiotic resistances and the possibility of spontaneous resolution, experts agree in considering amoxicillin the drug of choice for mild cases, and an antibiotic capable of overcoming all possible resistance for severe cases.
