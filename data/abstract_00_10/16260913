Seven antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected individuals with chronic hepatitis B treated with adefovir for longer than 6 months were assessed. Using bulk population sequencing and a sensitive limiting dilution analysis, the selection of K65R or other resistance mutations did not occur in HIV, suggesting that adefovir can be confidently used as hepatitis B virus (HBV) therapy in HIV/HBV-co-infected patients who do not require antiretroviral therapy.
