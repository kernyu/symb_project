This study looked for beta-lactamase production in 100 Prevotella isolates. MICs were determined for amoxycillin, ticarcillin, amoxycillin+clavulanate, cephalothin, cefuroxime, cefixime, cefpodoxime and cefotaxime using the reference agar dilution method (standard M11 A4, NCCLS). Beta-lactamase activity was detected in 58 of the 100 isolates, 24 of 46 black-pigmented Provotella and 34 of 54 non-pigmented Prevotella. All beta-lactamase-negative strains were susceptible to all beta-lactam antibiotics with the exception of cefuroxime and cefixime. Overall, resistance rates of Prevotella strains were lower for ticarcillin (8%) and celefotaxime (12%) than for the other cephalosporins. All Prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxycillin and were all inhibited by 2 mg/l or less amoxycillin [corrected].
