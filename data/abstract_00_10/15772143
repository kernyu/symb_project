Progress on rational intervention to prevent increasing antibiotic resistance has been slow. We suggest that this is because the science of resistance epidemiology has received little attention, and that a systematic, co-operative investigation of this area might yield a relevant knowledge base, analogous to the basis for effective public health intervention in infectious disease given by infection epidemiology. The steps required to progress this approach in the UK are discussed, along with a summary of what is known and speculation on what might emerge.
