Temocillin, a methoxy-derivative of the broad-spectrum penicillin, ticarcillin, has been introduced into clinical practice in Belgium in 1988. Since then, not many surveys of its in vitro activity have been published. This study addresses this issue in a prospective collection of 300 consecutive Gram-negative isolates originating from in-patients in five general hospitals throughout Belgium. In addition to temocillin, seven common antibiotics were tested: amoxicillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefotaxime, aztreonam, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and amikacin. Meropenem appeared to exhibit the best activity overall, whereas amoxicillin-clavulanate scored the worst. Cumulative MIC plot for two subsets of organisms are given: temocillin, meropenem and cefotaxime are the most active on E. coli and Klebsiella spp., while a significant percentage is resistant to ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate. In the group of inducible Enterobacteriaceae, temocillin, meropenem and amikacin are the most active drugs, while the activity of amoxicillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin is largely decreased. Taking this well preserved in vitro activity of temocillin into account, and looking at its convenient pharmacokinetics and low cost of acquisition, this drug may prove a useful alternative in the treatment of severe nosocomial infections.
