OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the FAEV regimen (floxuridine, actinomycin D, etoposide, vincristine) in the treatment of high-risk, drug-resistant gestational trophoblastic tumor (GTT). STUDY DESIGN: From October 2001 to May 2004, 11 cases of high-risk, drug-resistant GTT were treated with the FAEV regimen. All cases were referred to Peking Union Medical College Hospital because of previous failure of chemotherapy. The patients' ages ranged from 21 to 60 (median, 32) years. The International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians score was 7-13 (median, 9). All cases were followed for 15-42 months after FAEV treatment. RESULTS: Seven cases (63.6%, 7 of 11) were cured by the FAEV regimen. The median course number for serum human chorionic gonadotropin reaching a normal level was 3. Four cases (36%, 4 of 11) showed drug resistance to the FAEV regimen. The major side effect of FAEV regimen is myelosuppression. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support was needed after 98.4% (63 of 64) of the courses. CONCLUSION: For high-risk, drug-resistant GTT cases, FAEV regimen could be an effective treatment.
