We present a patient with a Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) refractory to standard induction chemotherapy. Treatment with the ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (Glivec, Gleevec, imatinib mesylate) resulted in a complete haematologic and cytogenetic remission. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation from an unrelated donor could be undertaken while the patient was in STI571-induced complete remission from the leukaemia. At present, the patient has a 15-month post-transplantation follow-up and is in stable molecular remission as evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for the BCR/ABL fusion gene transcript. Our case demonstrates that STI571 can act as a bridge to potentially curative allogeneic stem cell transplant in otherwise poor prognosis Ph+ ALL.
