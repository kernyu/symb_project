The aim of this study was to investigate porin absence or deficiency in two Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strains resistant to amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid. Their outer membrane protein (OMP) extracts and those of two susceptible strains were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and compared to detect differences between the strains. A protein band of interest at around 70 kDa electro-eluted for each strain, was tested in a liposome swelling assay. A decrease in initial absorbency was noted for the two susceptible strains but not for the two resistant strains. The liposome swelling of the two susceptible strains was directly visualized by photon microscopy and then photographed. This suggested a B. thetaiotaomicron porin of around 70 kDa could take part in resistance to beta-lactams.
