In Canada, there have been reported outbreaks of human salmonellosis related to exposure to animal-derived pet treats, involving pig ear treats, beef steak patty dog treats and pet treats of seafood origin. As a follow-up to recommendations made to the pig ear treat industry in 1999, a total of 245 pig ear treats were purchased in two Canadian cities to provide evidence of adoption of the recommendations and to determine the current levels of Salmonella contamination of pig ear treats available at pet stores. An overall prevalence of 4% was observed, with isolates exhibiting resistance to up to seven anti-microbials. Serotypes recovered included S. Bovismorbificans, S. Give, S. Derby and S. Typhimurium var. Copenhagen. Although the prevalence observed during this study is lower than the prevalence observed in 1999, pig ear treats should still be considered as a possible source of Salmonella and anti-microbial resistant bacteria to humans and dogs in Canada.
