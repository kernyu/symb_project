Linezolid is currently indicated to treat vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, nosocomial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae, complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, and community-acquired pneumonia. We report a case of linezolid-induced lactic acidosis during treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia after mitral valve replacement and permanent pacemaker implantation. We also review the current literature describing other cases of linezolid-associated hyperlactatemia.
