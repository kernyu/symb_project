UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was estimation of frequency and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of gram-negative rods isolated from clinical specimens obtained from patients requiring intensive care, with emphasis on profile of the unit. The analysis comprised strains of gram-negative rods isolated from patients of two intensive care units (ICUs) of a tertiary care hospital (1200 beds). Identification of cultured isolates was done using automated VITEK and API systems (bioMerieux, France). Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was tested by a disk-diffusion method according to the NCCLS recommendations. In total the analysis comprised 722 strains of gram-negative rods. In blood cultures predominated strains of Enterobacter spp. (42.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (37.5%). In cultures of clinical specimens other than blood 41.6% comprised strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 14.8% Escherichia coli and 14.4% Proteus mirabilis. Frequency of multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae was much higher among blood isolates in comparison to strains cultured from other clinical specimens. There was a relatively high percentage of strains of Enterobacteriaceae susceptible to piperacillin and tazobactam (69.0%) and ceftazidime (54.6%). CONCLUSIONS: 1. All strains were susceptible to carbapenems. 2. There was a relatively high percentage of strains of gram-negative rods susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. 3. Bacteria isolated from blood cultures were characterised by a much higher percentage of resistant strains in comparison to other specimens. 4. Longer stay in ICU promoted selection of strains resistant to antimicrobials.
