A recent increase of sexually transmitted infections (STI) of rectum and anus has been observed in France, particularly in men who have sex with men. Symptoms of STI are not specific and sometimes patients have no symptom, which implies a high risk of contamination. Ulcerations, vegetant lesions and proctitis are the main anorectal lesions observed. Infection by multiple germs is frequent. STI, particulary those including ulceration, facilitate the transmission of HIV. New therapeutic strategies have to be established as antimicrobial resistance of several sexually transmitted pathogens is increasing. The treatment of sex partners of patients diagnosed with an STI is essential. Education and counseling (use of condom) taking into account each patient's individual risk factors, are the main strategies in the prevention and control of STI.
