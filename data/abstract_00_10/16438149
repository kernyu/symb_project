Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important hospital and community-acquired pathogen. Rapid and reliable epidemiologic typing is necessary for controlling the spread of MRSA outbreak. The objective of this study was to compare the phenotyping with the genotyping method to differentiate MRSA isolates obtained from the two hospitals in Thailand (central and northeastern). Seventy-four MRSA isolates were randomly collected and confirmed by the presence of mecA gene. Antibiogram, phage typing and enterotoxin production were used for the phenotyping analysis. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with Smal digestion of chromosomal DNA was used for the genotyping analysis. We found 17 distinct profiles by the 3 phenotypic typing methods and 18 PFGE types designated as 5 major types (A-E) and 13 subtypes. The most frequent PFGE types and their related subtypes found in both hospitals were A and C, comprising 54 and 27%, respectively. The antibiogram could differentiate 6 different types. All isolates were resistant to the majority of antimicrobial agents tested, but were susceptible to vancomycin and fosfomycin. Ten (13.5%) MRSA isolates produced enterotoxin A. Nontypable phage and phage type 77 were found predominantly in MRSA isolated from the northeast and central hospital, respectively. A significant correlation was found between the phenotyping and the genotyping methods and there was a good correlation between antibiogram and PFGE. Antibiogram typing alone can be used as a useful epidemiological marker for practical purposes. PFGE types A and C were the common endemic MRSA clones in both hospitals in Thailand.
