OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the situation of HIV prevalence, incidence and drug resistance (DR) among recent HIV infected men who have sex with men(MSM) during the year of 2006. METHODS: A transect investigation was conducted through snowballing to recruite volunteers. HIV infected status was confirmed by ELISA and Western Blot (WB), the recent infected within 155 days were confirmed by BED-Capture ELISA Assay (BED-CEIA), which based on the principle that characteristics of the initial HIV antibody response in recent infections differs from those of established or long-term infections either by antibody titer, proportion, specificity, isotype or avidity. Bayer Trugene was applied to PCR the target sequence of HIV pol gene, and the sequences were analyzed to detect the prevalence of HIV gene mutation. Furthermore, HIV antiretroviral drug resistance among MSM was evaluated. The results were analyzed through three methods: Trugene DR 3.7 IVD (2006/07/27) Guidelines 11.0 (2005/12/15) provided by Bayer company, Stanford HIVdb and Geno2pheno. RESULTS: The prevalence and incidence of HIV among MSM were 10.4% and 7.98% PY, by three methods. There was only 1 sample found to have occurred resistant primary mutation which could be inferred that the average DR ratio was 4.55% (1/22). CONCLUSION: The incidence and prevalence of MSM in Chongqing were notable, and the mutation rate stands at a low level when comparing to researches conducted in developed countries. Secondary mutations appeared frequently, suggesting that more research need to be conducted to understand how HIV was transmitting among the carriers.
