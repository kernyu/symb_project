Surveillance data for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug resistance (MDR) among MRSA were analyzed by patient location and age. MRSA rates were 55.7% among inpatients (53.9% MDR) and 48.7% among outpatients (30.7% MDR), with MDR rates increasing with age. These findings could impact the guidelines for the management and treatment of staphylococcal infections.
