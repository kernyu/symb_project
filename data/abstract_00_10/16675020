Subdiaphragmatic abscess has not yet been reported as a manifestation of tuberculosis. We report an IgA deficient patient with recurrent episodes of unusual extrapulmonary manifestations of tuberculosis including subdiaphragmatic abscesses and metacarpophalangeal osteomyelitis that was improved each time with antituberculosis drugs. There was not any resistance to the drugs used against mycobacterium despite repeated courses of antituberculosis regimens. In such recurrent cases, one should rule out any immunodeficiency states.
