We previously showed that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced resistance artery relaxation independent of endothelium. Thus, in this study we investigated the mechanism of relaxation induced by H2O2 on human renal vascular smooth muscle cell (HVSMC). HVSMC were stimulated with H2O2 and/or angiotensin II (Ang II), proline-rich-tyrosine-kinase-2 (PYK2), ERK1/2 MAP-Kinase, and myosin light chain 20 phosphorylation (Lc20) were assessed using Western blot analysis in the presence of potassium channel blockers, MAP-Kinase, and nitric oxide synthesis (NOS) inhibitors. H2O2 increased PYK2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and at the same time decreased Lc20 phosphorylation. AngII increased phosphorylation of PYK2, ERK1/2 and Lc20, whereas, the pretreatment of HVSMC with H2O2 decreased Lc20 phosphorylation induced by AngII. MEK inhibition, decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but had no effect on the inhibition of phosphorylation of Lc20 induced by H2O2. The inhibition of Ca2(+)-dependent K+ channels (BKCa) and NOS did not block the decrease of Lc20 phosphorylation in response to H2O2. On the other hand, pretreatment of HVSMC with 60 mM of KCl, increased rather than decreased Lc20 phosphorylation in response to H2O2. This study shows the evidence that H2O2 acts as a relaxing factor and as an activator of PYK2 and ERK1/2 in Human renal VSMC. The relaxation induced by H2O2 is independent of BKCa, ERK1/2 MAP-Kinase and NOS pathways. The relaxing effect to H2O2 changes to contracting effect when the potassium channels are compromised.
