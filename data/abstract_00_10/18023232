IRG proteins (also known as p47 GTPases) are key mediators of interferon-gamma-induced resistance to pathogens. Absence of certain IRG proteins leads to profound susceptibility to protozoa and bacteria in mice. Underlying their roles in host resistance, IRG proteins regulate the processing of pathogen-containing vacuoles in host cells, and regulate hematopoiesis following infection.
