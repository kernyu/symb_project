Wild-type and efflux pump-deficient cells of Candida albicans adhering to silicone were compared with planktonic cells by flow cytometry for their relative resistance to fluconazole (FCZ). Flow cytometry data on cells carrying a fusion of green fluorescent protein to efflux pump promoters confirmed that enhanced tolerance of attached cells to FCZ was due in part to increased expression of CaMDR1 and CDR1 promoters. Within 2 h of their attachment to silicone, the adherent cells demonstrated levels of FCZ tolerance shown by cells from 24-h biofilms. Following their mechanical detachment, this subset of cells retained a four- to eightfold increase in tolerance compared with the tolerance of planktonic cells for at least two generations. Enhanced efflux pump tolerance to FCZ appeared to be induced within the initial 15 min of attachment in a subset of cells that were firmly attached to the substrata.
