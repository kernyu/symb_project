Treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis requires a prolonged antibiotic therapy with vancomycin. Because of its weak diffusion, the in situ implantation of vancomycin could be interesting. The activity of vancomycin encapsulated in microparticles was evaluated in vitro and in vivo on rabbit osteomyelitis and showed a good activity compared to intravenous administration.
