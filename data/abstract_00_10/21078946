A prospective multicenter surveillance program on yeast bloodstream infections was implemented in the Paris, France, area without restrictions on ward of hospitalization (intensive care unit, hematology, and surgery) or age (adults and children). The present analysis concerns 2,618 isolates collected over 7 years from 2,441 patients. Centralized species identification and antifungal susceptibility testing using the EUCAST methodology were performed. Almost 10% (232/2,441) of the patients had recently (</=30 days) been treated with antifungal drugs. We analyzed the effect of recent exposure to fluconazole (n = 159) or caspofungin (n = 61) on the proportions of the five major Candida species. For both drugs, preexposure was associated with a decreased prevalence of Candida albicans in favor of less drug-susceptible species (C. glabrata and C. krusei for the former and C. parapsilosis and, to a lesser extent, C. glabrata and C. krusei for the latter; P = 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the risk of being infected with an isolate with decreased susceptibility to fluconazole was independently associated with an age of >/=15 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39 to 4.31; P = 0.002) and with recent exposure to fluconazole (OR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.51 to 3.13; P < 0.001), while the risk of being infected with an isolate with decreased susceptibility to caspofungin was independently associated with an age <15 years (OR = 2.53; 95% CI = 1.43 to 4.48; P = 0.001) and with recent exposure to caspofungin (OR = 4.79; 95% CI = 2.47 to 9.28; P < 0.001). These findings could influence future recommendations for the management of candidemia.
