This article summarizes a Swedish consensus guidance document on the use of antiviral drugs in the management of influenza. Vaccination remains the cornerstone for influenza prophylaxis. Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors is recommended for high-risk groups and individuals hospitalised with influenza. Chemoprophylaxis is targeted at high-risk groups and should be considered on a case by case basis depending on the circumstances. Unvaccinated at-risk patients or seasonal vaccine strain mismatch were identified as potential indications for antiviral prophylaxis. Oseltamivir prophylaxis can otherwise be considered for influenza in a household including an at-risk individual and in outbreaks in hospitals and nursing homes. The use of antivirals in a pandemic situation is also discussed.
