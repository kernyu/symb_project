Susceptibility of nosocomial potential AmpC-beta-lactamases producers strains (n=128), isolated from patients admitted to 30 medical centers of 15 various regions of Russia has been investigated. The susceptibility testing was performed by the broth microdilution method. The most active antibacterial agents acting to the investigated strains remained carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem). PCR-based detection of beta-lactamase genes (TEM, SHV, CTX) was investigated in 51 E. cloacae strains. Alone or in various combinations TEM type beta-lactamases have been found in 31 (60.8%) isolates, SHV in 22 (43.1%), and CTX--in 22 (43.1%). There were negative results of TEM, SHV, CTX beta-lactamases genotyping in 13 (25.5%) E. cloacae suspect strains.
