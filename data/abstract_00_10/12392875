Rectal swabs from healthy cats and dogs, and from dogs and cats with clinical diarrhoea were collected approximately every third month from May 2000 to June 2001 from six small-animal practices throughout Norway. A questionnaire was filled in for each animal. Of the 301 healthy cats sampled, 54 (18%) were positive for Campylobacter, compared to 5 out of 31 (16%) cats with diarrhoea. Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from 11 (3%), C. upsaliensis from 42 (13%) and C. coli from 2 (0.6%) of the cats sampled. Isolates from four cats (1%) could not be specified. Of the 529 healthy dogs, 124 (23%) were positive for Campylobacter, compared to 18 of 66 (27%) dogs with diarrhoea. C. jejuni was isolated from 20 (3%) and C. upsaliensis from 117 (20%) of the dogs sampled. Isolates from five dogs (0.8%) could not be specified. Eighteen out of the 20 investigated C. upsaliensis samples were resistant to streptomycin. The clinically healthy animals were included in the analysis to identify factors associated with Campylobacter prevalence. The cat model had low classification ability. The dog-data model indicated increased odds of infection with Campylobacter for dogs </=1 year, and in dogs sampled during the spring. No difference was observed between the prevalence of Campylobacter infections in cats and dogs with diarrhoea and healthy animals.
