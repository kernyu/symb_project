This study was designed to determine the serotypes, genotypes, and antibiotic resistance (AbR) patterns of 42 Salmonella isolates recovered from either fecal or litter samples of 12 commercial turkey farms across two seasons (summer and winter) and two ages (3 and 19 weeks). Isolates were serotyped on the basis of the Kauffmann-White scheme. Genotyping was done by restriction digestion of cDNA (XbaI) and subsequent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The AbR was determined with Sensititre susceptibility plates. Serovar Kentucky was the most prevalent serotype (26%), followed by Senftenberg (19%), Muenster (17%), Mbandaka (10%), Javiana (7%), Hadar (5%), Heidelberg (5%), 8,(20):nonmotile (5%), Agona (2%), Infantis (2%), and 4,12:r:-(2%). Serovars Kentucky, Heidelberg, Hadar, and 8,(20):nonmotile were isolated only from the 19-week-old bird samples, whereas Senftenberg and Muenster were isolated only from the young birds (3 weeks old). Isolates within any one serotype showed minor PFGE banding pattern differences, but dendogram analysis indicated that sequence variability between serotypes was more significant than within serotypes. Isolates were resistant to tetracycline (86%), sulfisoxazole (71%), streptomycin (64%), gentamicin (41%), ampicillin (36%), kanamycin (26%), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (7%), nalidixic acid (5%), cefoxitin (2%), and ceftiofur (2%). One isolate (Muenster) was resistant to nine antibiotics (2%), and the others were resistant to six (7%), five (12%), four (10%), three (21%), two (24%), and one (10%) antibiotic. Only two isolates (5%) were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. The AbR patterns were affected by age; on average, strains recovered from young birds were resistant to more than four drugs compared with fewer than three in older birds (P < 0.05). This study showed that Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotypes, genotypes and AbR patterns were affected by bird age but not by season or farm.
