A joint study by the Public Health Laboratory Service and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency of resistance to antimicrobials in isolates of Salmonella enterica serotypes Enteritidis, Typhimurium, Hadar, and Virchow from humans and food-producing animals in England and Wales in 2000 has demonstrated that resistance was most common in Typhimurium, particularly in strains of definitive phage type (DT) 104. However resistance was also common in other phage types, particularly DTs 193 and 208 and phage type U302. Multiresistant strains of DT208 appeared to be predominantly associated with pigs; for the other phage types, the human/food-producing animal relationships of drug-resistant isolates were more complex. For Enteritidis, Virchow, and Hadar, there were substantial differences in the resistance spectra of isolates from humans and food-producing animals, suggesting that food-producing animals bred in England and Wales may not be the primary sources of drug-resistant strains of these serotypes causing infections in humans. Further phenotypic and molecular comparison of drug-resistant isolates of these serotypes may be required to ascertain the sources of strains responsible for infections in humans.
