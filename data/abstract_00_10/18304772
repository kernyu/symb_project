The in vitro activity of daptomycin was evaluated against 360 multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates (including hospital-acquired isolates) and multidrug-susceptible community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus with known virulence genes. All isolates were inhibited at <or=1 microg/mL, suggesting that daptomycin has excellent activity against both hospital-acquired and community-acquired S. aureus isolates.
