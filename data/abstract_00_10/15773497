Occurrence of high-level mupirocin resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci in 5 hospitals in the region of Gdansk was determined. The study was carried out on 192 staphylococcal strains isolated from patients and medical staff. The mupirocin resistant strains were detected by 5 microgram mupirocin disc. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for mupirocin was estimated by E-tests. The mupirocin resistant strains were characterised by antibiotic sensitivity, including MIC for glycopeptides and oxacillin. Biotypes of resistant strains were also determined. Eight high-level mupirocin resistant strains (4.7%) were found. Only one strain expressed low-level resistance. All but one of high-level mupirocin resistant strains were resistant to methicillin. Six of them belonged to the S. epidermidis species but differences in the biotypes and antibiotic resistance patterns of these strains suggest they did not have a common origin.
