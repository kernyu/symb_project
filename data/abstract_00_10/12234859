The activities of BMS-284576, clinafloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, trovafloxacin, imipenem, cefoxitin, and clindamycin against 589 Bacteroides fragilis group isolates were determined. The activity of BMS-284576 was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. Sitafloxacin and clinafloxacin were the most active quinolones, and moxifloxacin was the least active. B. fragilis was the most susceptible of the species, and Bacteroides vulgatus was the most resistant. Association of specific antibiotic resistance with Bacteroides species was noted for all quinolones.
