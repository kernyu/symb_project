This study was done to investigate the antimicrobial potentiality of the marine algae collected from different coastal regions of Gujarat and screened for the same. Twenty-six marine algae belonging to Rhodophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Phaeophyceae were screened for their potential antibacterial activity against five clinically important bacterial strains, namely Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus flavus, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas testosterone. Acetone and methanol were used for extraction; and the extracted yield was more when the solvent used was methanol. The antibacterial activity was done by both Agar disc diffusion method and Agar ditch method. The five bacterial strains showed varied response towards marine algal extracts. The most susceptible bacteria was B. cereus followed by K. pneumoniae and C. freundii while the most resistant bacteria were M. flavus and P. testosteroni. Among the 26 algae screened, E. intestinalis was the most potent alga and thus, this alga was selected for further studies. E. intestinalis was extracted in petroleum ether, 1,4-dioxan, acetone, methanol and DMF, and their antibacterial activity was studied against the above-stated five bacterial strains using agar disc method. Maximum extractive value of E. intestinalis was in methanol (2.05%) and minimum was in acetone (0.38%). The most susceptible bacteria was K. pneumoniae and maximum antibacterial activity was shown by petroleum ether extract and minimum was shown by 1,4-dioxan extract. The most resistant bacteria were M. flavus and C. freundii. The MIC values of E. intestinalis extracts ranged from 2500-9.765 microg/0.5 ml against B. cereus and K. pneumoniae. From these results it is concluded that the acetone extract of E. intestinalis is the most potent extract and can be used as a lead molecule in drug discovery in inhibiting some of the bacterial strains. E. intestinalis can be used as a promising novel marine antimicrobial agent in the coming years.
