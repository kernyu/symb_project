The results of experiments on Wistar rats under acute methanol poisoning conditions (1 LD 50) showed that ethanol serves as an antidote of methanol. Ethanol reduces nonspecific resistance of the organism and decreases activity of the native killer cells, antibody production mainly with respect to the T-dependent antigen, antibody-mediated cell cytotoxicity, and the formation of delayed type hypersensitivity.
