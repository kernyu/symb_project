Mechanical debridement, with of without flap elevation, is a difficult and technique-sensitive procedure resulting in suboptimal treatment outcome from time to time. Therefore, it is not surprising that antibiotics and antiseptics, used alone or in combination with scaling and root planing, have always been fairly successful in clinical practice. For a number of reasons discussed in this paper, routine use of these agents cannot be justified. Especially in general practice these agents should not be prescribed; at least not for treating periodontitis.
