The significance of monitoring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) value during the study on drug absorption through Caco-2 monolayers in Transwells was re-evaluated. TEER value was monitored before, during, and after the absorption of Streptokinase (45 KD). Four enhancers--disodium ethylenediaminetetracetate (disodium EDTA), sodium cholate (NaC), sodium taurocholate (NaTC), and sodium caprate along with alpha-hemolysin (a cell membrane pore-forming toxin)--were used to signify the outcome of this study. Modified trypan blue exclusion technique was used to examine the Caco-2 cell viability throughout the absorption studies. The enhancers at the used concentration exhibited toxic effect on the Caco-2 cells as evident from the trypan blue exclusion studies. This toxic effect was not reflected by the TEER profile because TEER value dropped after the addition of the absorption enhancers. But it came back to its initial value after the cell culture media was replaced by enhancer-free media. This toxic effect was confirmed by the antiproliferation studies on the four enhancers and alpha-hemolysin against Caco-2 cells. Therefore, we concluded that the measurement of TEER is not a reliable method to determine the absorption enhancers toxicity or integrity of the Caco-2 monolayers in the Transwells.
