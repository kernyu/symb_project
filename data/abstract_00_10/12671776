BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology underquantifies viral loads in patients with non-B clades of HIV-1. Testing with bDNA technology gave higher viral loads in these subtypes. A study was conducted to determine whether virologically responding patients on HAART who were not immunologically responding would have higher viral loads using bDNA technology and whether these differences were due to non-B clades. METHOD: Forty-eight patients receiving HAART for more than 6 months who were having inappropriate immunologic responses in spite of undetectable or very low viral loads determined by RT-PCR (<3000 copies by Roche Amplicor 1.0) were studied. These patients had bDNA viral loads performed. All patients who had bDNA viral loads equivalent to >3000 by RT-PCR had clade and genotypic studies performed. RESULTS: Fifteen patients had viral loads by bDNA that were equivalent to >3000 copies by RT-PCR. Four of these were found to have non-B clades (one D clade and three AG clade). The D clade patient had multidrug resistance; none of the AG clade patients had resistance. Of the remaining 11 patients, virus could not be recovered from 2 and 9 had a B clade. Six of these nine had genotypic resistance to HAART drugs. CONCLUSION: bDNA testing may be useful in the immunologically nonresponding patient.
