The ECO.SENS study investigated the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens causing community-acquired acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 4734 women aged 18-65 years presenting with symptoms of acute UTI, at 252 community healthcare centres in 16 countries in Europe plus Canada. Resistance in Escherichia coli occurred most frequently to ampicillin (30%) and sulphonamides (29%), followed by trimethoprim (15%), trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (14%) and nalidixic acid (5%) but was low to co-amoxiclav, mecillinam, cefadroxil, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, all at<3%. Consumption of antibiotics in 1997 varied more than 4-fold within Europe and from 9 to 37 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day, the consumption being highest in Southern Europe. The consumption of broad-spectrum penicillins correlated with resistance to ampicillin and there was a clear correlation between quinolone consumption and resistance to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid. The 4-fold difference in antibiotic consumption within Europe and the correlation to resistance emphasises the importance of controlling antibiotic usage.
