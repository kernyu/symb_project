The effects of glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) on expression and activity of jejunal multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2; Abcc2) and glutathione transferase (GST) were evaluated. After GLP-2 treatment (12 mug/100 g b.wt. s.c., every 12 h, for 5 consecutive days), Mrp2 and the alpha class of GST proteins and their corresponding mRNAs were increased, suggesting a transcriptional regulation. Mrp2 was localized at the apical membrane of the enterocyte in control and GLP-2 groups, as detected by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. As a functional assay, everted intestinal sacs were incubated in the presence of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in the mucosal compartment, and the glutathione-conjugated derivative, dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione (DNP-SG; model Mrp2 substrate), was detected in the same compartment by high-performance liquid chromatography. A significant increase in apical secretion of DNP-SG was detected in the GLP-2 group, consistent with simultaneous up-regulation of Mrp2 and GST. GLP-2 also promoted an increase in cAMP levels as detected in homogenates of intestinal mucosa. Treatment of rats with 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine (DDA), a specific inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase, abolished the increase in cAMP levels and Mrp2 protein promoted by GLP-2, suggesting cAMP as a mediator of Mrp2 modulation. Increased expression of Mrp2 and cAMP levels in response to GLP-2 occurred not only at the tip but also at the middle region of the villus, where constitutive expression of Mrp2 is normally low. In conclusion, our study suggests a role for GLP-2 in the prevention of cell toxicity of the intestinal mucosa by increasing Mrp2 chemical barrier function.
