Looking for therapeutic options, we assessed the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 7 antimicrobial agents against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 58) and Escherichia coli (n = 84) isolates. High rates of susceptibility were shown for both E coli and K pneumoniae against ertapenem (100% for both), piperacillin/tazobactam (83% and 91%, respectively) and amikacin (96% and 82%, respectively). In addition, most K pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to quinolones (72%-75%) and cefepime (88%). However, clinical correlation is warranted.
