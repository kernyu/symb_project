A simple method to detect mutations in the genome of Mycobacterium leprae that confer resistance to key drugs for leprosy was exploited on the basis of a reverse hybridization system. A series of oligonucleotide probes corresponding to each mutation in the folP1, rpoB and gyrA genes for dapsone, rifampicin and ofloxacin resistance, respectively, were selected and fixed on a glass slide as capture probes, to develop a DNA microarray termed the leprosy drug susceptibility-DNA microarray (LDS-DA). Mutations in clinical isolates of M. leprae were successfully identified by the LDS-DA. Feasibility studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of the LDS-DA in two developing countries, Myanmar and the Philippines. The high concordance of the results obtained by this method with the results of nucleotide sequencing strongly supports the applicability of the LDS-DA as a drug susceptibility test in place of sequencing, a time-consuming and costly procedure. This is a rapid and simple method for the simultaneous susceptibility testing of three front-line drugs for leprosy, and solves the problems of previously reported methods.
