Bacterial contamination with pan-resistant Acinetobacter and Klebsiella, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was noted on the surfaces of dispensers of hand soap with 2% chlorhexidine. Gram-negative isolates could multiply in the presence of 1% chlorhexidine. In contrast, MRSA was inhibited in vitro by chlorhexidine at concentrations as low as 0.0019%.
