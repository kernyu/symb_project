Facultative anaerobic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, are more resistant to cephalosporin antibiotics during anaerobic growth. Strict anaerobic ambience reduces beta-lactamase production or the enzyme affinities for their substrates. A different balance between DNA gyrase and topoisomerase I activity, during aerobic and anaerobic growth condition, could be related to the bacteria behavior.
