This study aimed to characterize the resistance profiles of the Staphylococcus sciuri group members to macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramins (MLS antibiotics), and linezolid upon analysis of large series of isolates that included 162 S. sciuri isolates, nine S. lentus, and one S. vitulinus. The evaluation of their susceptibility by disk diffusion and agar dilution methods, along with PCR detection of the resistance genes erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), mef(A), lnu(A), and lnu(B), were performed. Resistance to macrolides was detected in 10 (5.8%) tested strains, with three and six isolates exhibiting constitutive and inducible MLS(B) resistance phenotypes, respectively. Resistance mediated by active efflux was detected in one strain. The presence of genes conferring resistance, namely erm(B) or erm(C), was detected in two strains. All tested strains were susceptible to pristinamycin and linezolid. Of 172 tested strains, 70.9% were resistant and 26.2% had intermediary resistance to lincomycin, whereas 1.7% were resistant and 50% had intermediary resistance to clindamycin. The lnu(A) gene was detected in two strains only. The great majority of the tested S. sciuri strains (153 out of 162; 94.4%) presumably exhibited LS(A) phenotype because they did not carry lnu genes nor displayed constitutive MLSB resistance, but still showed intermediate resistance or resistance to lincomycin (MICs of 4, 8, 16, and 32 microg/ml). The results obtained indicate that S. sciuri may be naturally resistant to lincomycin. Expression of a novel type of inducible resistance to lincosamides, induced by erythromycin in erythromycinsusceptible strains, was observed in the S. sciuri group isolates.
