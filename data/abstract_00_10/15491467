BACKGROUND/AIMS: Oral treponemes are implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. We have previously shown that Treponema denticola ATCC type strains and strain GM-1 are resistant to killing by human beta-defensins (hbetaD)-1 and -2. We hypothesize that resistance to beta-defensins is a common feature of oral treponemes, which allows colonization and persistence in the oral cavity. In this study, we tested additional isolates of T. denticola, as well as six other species of treponemes, for resistance to hbetaD-1, -2 and -3. We also examined the four ATCC strains of T. denticola and strain GM-1 for resistance to hbetaD-3. METHODS: Resistance was determined by motility and Alamar Blue assays for metabolic activity. RESULTS: All T. denticola strains tested were resistant to hbetaD-1, -2 and -3, with the exception of strain Ambigua, which was sensitive to hbetaD-2 and -3. All other treponemes except Treponema vincentii were resistant to hbetaD-1. Treponema pectinovorum was sensitive to hbetaD-2, while T. vincentii, T. pectinovorum and Treponema maltophilum were sensitive to hbetaD-3. Escherichia coli was used as a control organism and was killed by all three defensins. CONCLUSION: Resistance to the constitutively expressed hbetaD-1 may assist treponemes in initial colonization of epithelial surfaces, while resistance to the inducible hbetaD-2 and -3 would allow some treponemes to survive in active periodontal lesions.
