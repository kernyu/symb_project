OBJECTIVE: To prepare the engineering peptide Pheromonicin-P. aeruginosa (Ph-PA) and evaluate the antibactericidal activity of prepared Ph-PA against P. aeruginosa via in vitro/in vivo bactericidal assays. METHODS: Ph-PA was purified by CM sepharose ion-exchange column. In vitro/in vivo bactericidal assays were performed to identify the antibactericidal activity of Ph-PA against P. aeruginosa. RESULTS: In vitro and in vivo data showed that antibactericidal effects of Ph-PA, on molar basis, were approximately over 2200 times greater than that of piperacillin, and 220 times greater than that of ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: The Ph-PA may have potentially applied value as a novel kind of peptide antibiotics against P. aeruginosa infection.
