OBJECTIVE: To identify the role of Ph-SA in inhibiting beta-lactamase secretion of S. aureus and in enhancing the bactericidal activity of antibiotics against antibiotic resistant bacteria. METHODS: To determine the effects of Ph-SA on beta-lactamase product of bacteria and on bactericidal activity of penicillin, the growth rate and lactamase activity of penicillin-resistant S. aureus cells in exponential growth were detected after treatment with 1.43 X 10(-4) micromol/mL (10 microg/mL) Ph-SA (Group 1), 2.81 x 10(-2) micromol/mL (10 microg/mL) penicillin (Group 2), 0.715 x 10(-4) micromol/mL(5 microg/mL) Ph-SA + 1.40 x 10(-2) micromol/mL (5 microg/mL) penicillin (Group 3) respectively; and a control group was detected for comparison. The same method was used to detect whether Ph-SA could enhance bactericidal activity of Cefazolin. Results It was revealed that 1.43 x 10(-4) micromol/mL (10 microg/mL) Ph-SA could inhibit beta-lactamase activity significantly, whereas no marked bactericidal activity was detected. The growth rate of bacteria cells treated with 0.715 x 10(-4) micromol/mL Ph-SA + 1.40 x 10(-2) mol/mL penicillin and that of bacteria cells treated with 0. 715 x 10(-4) micromol/mL (5 microg/mL) Ph-SA + 1.05 x 10(-2) micromol/mL (5 microg/mL) Cefazolin were the same as those treated by 2.81 x 10(-)2 micromol/mL (10 microg/mL)penicillin and 2.10 x 10(-2) micromol/mL (10 microg/mL) Cefazolin respectively, while the beta-lactamase activities of both groups were lower than control. CONCLUSION: Ph-SA may be of value in enhancing the bactericidal activity of antibiotics and in alleviating the resistance of bacteria by inhibition of beta-lactamase activity.
