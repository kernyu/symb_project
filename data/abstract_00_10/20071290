The aim of this study was to characterize the pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities in children with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in order to optimize empirical antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis. from 2001 to 2006, 895 children with an indwelling catheter from 3 hospitals in China were included in this study, of whom 335 (37.4%) had CAUTI. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 450 bacterial isolates was performed using the ClSi broth and Kirby-bauer agar dilution methods. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus spp. E. coli had higher susceptibility to ceftazidime (87.4%), cefuroxime (85.1%) and cefatrizine (76.6%) than to sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) (8.0%), amoxicillin (21.7%), ampicillin (17.1%) and cefazolin (37.7%). Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus species had similar patterns as E. coli. S. aureus had lower susceptibility to SmZ (6.8%), ampicillin (8.2%), and amoxicillin (24.7%); the trend of S. epidermidis was similar. This study demonstrates that the Gram-negative species are the predominating uropathogens of CAUti in children. it is important to know the bacterial spectrum and the susceptibility patterns to various classes of antibiotic agents to improve empiric antibiotic therapy of children with CAUTI in China.
