A total of 83 Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and 58 Actinobacillus porcitonsillarum strains collected from slaughtered pigs in Switzerland were screened for susceptibility to 20 antimicrobial agents by MIC determinations. Resistance to sulfamethoxazole, the combination sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, tiamulin, tilmicosin, tetracycline, penicillin and ampicillin were found. A few A. porcitonsillarum isolates displayed decreased susceptibility to enrofloxacin. PCR analysis revealed the presence of the sul2 gene in approximately one-fifth of the sulfonamide-resistant A. pleuropneumoniae and A. porcitonsillarum isolates. The tetracycline-resistant A. pleuropneumoniae harbored tet(B) and tet(H), whereas the tetracycline-resistant A. porcitonsillarum isolates harbored the tet(B) gene. The penicillin and ampicillin-resistant A. pleuropneumoniae and A. porcitonsillarum harbored the bla(ROB-1) gene.
