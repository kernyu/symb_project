The problems presented by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) must be accommodated in both prophylactic and treatment regimens for orthopaedic implant surgery. The rationale of pre-admission nasal swabbing in directing prophylaxis for orthopaedic patients is discussed. The potential advantage of nasal mupirocin for Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA carriers is described. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis is commented upon as another hazard in orthopaedics. Criteria for choosing glycopeptides in the treatment of implant infections are discussed, and need to be defined in orthopaedic units. Treatment regimens are briefly described.
