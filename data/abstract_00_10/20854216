We describe a patient with multiple myeloma who developed a pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus infection during chemotherapy. The clinical condition of the patient worsened and viral shedding persisted despite 10 days of peramivir treatment; however viral shedding ceased and the patient recovered completely with inhaled zanamivir.
