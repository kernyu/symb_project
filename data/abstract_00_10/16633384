BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Poverty, drug resistance and the advent of human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) have led to a recent upsurge in the incidence of tuberculosis including intracranial tuberculosis. In this article, we report 3 patients who had solitary brain tuberculomas and were otherwise healthy to underscore the importance of continuing vigilance for this disease. CASE REPORTS: Three patients (57 years, female; 52 years, male; 7 years male) presented to our unit with features of intracranial tumours. They were all HIV negative with no previous history of tuberculosis. Cranial computed tomography scans demonstrated uniformly contrast enhancing falcine supratentorial masses in the adult patients and a cerebellar hemispheric lesion with peripheral contrast enhancement in the paediatric patient INTERVENTION: All the patients had gross total tumour excision. The histology confirmed a tuberculoma. They all had antituberculous therapy after histological confirmation. The outcome was good in all the patients. CONCLUSION: Intracranial tuberculoma can occur in otherwise healthy individuals and should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of solitary intracranial mass lesions in sub-Saharan Africans so that minimally invasive procedures can be used to establish the correct diagnosis.
