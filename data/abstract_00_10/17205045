The relationship between H. pylori clarithromycin resistance and genetic pattern distribution has been differently explained from different geographic areas. Therefore, we aimed to assess the clarithromycin resistance rate, to evaluate the bacterial genetic pattern, and to search for a possible association between clarithromycin resistance and cagA or vacA genes. This prospective study enrolled 62 consecutive H. pylori infected patients. The infection was established by histology and rapid urease test. Clarithromycin resistance, cagA and vacA status, including s/m subtypes, were assessed on paraffin-embedded antral biopsy specimens by TaqMan real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primary clarithromycin resistance was detected in 24.1 % of cases. The prevalence of cagA was 69.3 %, and a single vacA mosaicism was observed in 95.1 % cases. In detail, the s1m1 was observed in 23 (38.9 %) patients, the s1m2 in 22 (37.2 %), and the s2m2 in 14 (23.7 %), whereas the s2m1 combination was never found. The prevalence of cagA and the vacA alleles distribution did not significantly differ between susceptible and resistant strains. Primary clarithromycin resistance is high in our area. The s1m1 and s1m2 are the most frequent vacA mosaicisms. There is no a relationship between clarithromycin resistance and bacterial genotypic pattern and/or cagA positivity.
