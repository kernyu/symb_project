Therapeutic approaches based solely on cytokine are meanwhile no longer recommended without restrictions as the primary therapy for metastatic renal cancer due to the reduced clinical response and the promising available data regarding molecular therapy. Several randomized controlled studies have been performed since the introduction of the so-called targeted therapies for metastatic renal cancer. Substantial data relevant for drug approval are available for the multikinase inhibitors sorafenib (Nexavar) and sunitinib (Sutent), the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus (Torisel), and the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab (Avastin) in combination with interferon-alpha. Sunitinib, temsirolimus, and bevacizumab are approved for first-line treatment, whereas sorafenib was approved for second-line treatment in Germany.Clinical trials are currently investigating the questions of optimal timing, value of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment, form, and sequence of the molecular targeted therapy. Experimental investigations for a better understanding of signaling pathways will preferably allow preselecting patients for an individualized therapy in metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC). The aim of the present paper is to address and to critically discuss the clinical data that are currently available regarding"targeted" therapeutics during the treatment of metastatic RCC.
