A shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O26 strain resistant to cefotaxime (CTX) and cefpodoxime (but not ceftazidime) was isolated from the faecal sample of a 17-year-old outpatient with diarrhea. The double disk synergy test, twin test, polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis confirmed that the strain produced CTX-M-3 type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Conjugation experiment results suggested that the CTX resistance in this strain was determined by an approximately 85kbp plasmid that was readily transferable to a susceptible recipient E. coli strain. This is the first report from Japan of CTX-M-3type ESBL-producing STEC O26.
