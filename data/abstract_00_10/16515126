Salmonella osteomyelitis of the rib is a rare clinical entity. In our case, a muhidrug resistant Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi was isolated from an immuno-competent patient with osteomyclitis of the ribs, who was treated earlier with ciprotloxacin for typhoid fever. The patient was successfully treated for osteomyclitis with intravenous ceftriaxone.
