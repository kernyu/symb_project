Aging is the progressive accumulation of changes with time that are responsible for the ever-increasing likelihood of disease and death. The precise cascade of pathological events mainly responsible for aging are still not clearly understood, but enhanced production of free radicals and its deleterious effects on proteins, nucleic acids, and fats, as well as enhanced glycosylation of proteins and DNA are prevalent during aging. Insulin resistance may be a common etiology, at least in part, behind the pathobiological alterations of advancing age. Prevalent age-related disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and cancer have been associated with impaired glucose/insulin metabolism and its consequences. This leads to future strategies to combat the aging process and chronic disorders such as the components of syndrome X associated with aging. Increasing the intake of antioxidants and/or substances recognized to enhance insulin sensitivity is a natural means of combatting the glucose/insulin perturbations and free radical damage. Accordingly, ingestion of niacin-bound chromium and natural antioxidants such as grape seed proanthocyanidin extract has been demonstrated to improve insulin sensitivity and/or ameliorate free radical formation and reduce the signs/symptoms of chronic age-related disorders including syndrome X. These natural strategies possess a highly favorable risk/benefit ratio.
