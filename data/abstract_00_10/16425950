Antibiotics are widely used in critical care and adequate empirical treatments has a significant impact on the outcome of many patients. Most nosocomial infections may be due to multidrug-resistant pathogens and requires empirical borad spectrum coverage before identification of the etiologic agents. This is associated with overuse of antibiotics which contributes to the further increase in multidrug-resistances. In this context, new strategies targeted at antibiotic control, such as guidelines and de-escalation are needed to control this evolution.
