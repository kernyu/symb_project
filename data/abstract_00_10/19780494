In this paper, relations between the number of nosocomial infections caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens and antibiotic-therapy were investigated. It was found that the number of MRSA infections is directly proportional to the amount of CAZ (ceftazidime) used in the therapy. It was also stated that CAZ, Amc (amoxicillin-clavulan acid) and IPM (imipenem) are strong inductors of ESBL. A good correlation between the number of infections caused by ESBL(+) strains and the total consumption of these antibiotics was found. A growing number of infections generated by Ps. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. strains resistant to carbapenems as a result of IPM therapy is also an anxiety-provoking fact. In this case, the changes in the number of isolated IPM-R streins occur only after approx. half an year from the changes in the IPM consumption.
