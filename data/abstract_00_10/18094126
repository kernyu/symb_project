The distribution of conjugative-plasmid-mediated 16S rRNA methylase genes among amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae collected between 1995 and 1998 and between 2001 and 2006 at a university hospital in South Korea was examined, and conjugative plasmids carrying the 16S rRNA methylase genes were characterized by PCR-based replicon typing and by determination of their antimicrobial resistance pattern. Among the 7,127 isolates, 463 isolates showed a high level of resistance to amikacin, and 218 of the 463 isolates transferred amikacin resistance by conjugation. Among the 218 isolates, armA was detected in 153 isolates (88 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 28 Escherichia coli, 19 Enterobacter cloacae, and 6 Serratia marcescens isolates and 12 isolates of other organisms), and rmtB was detected in 51 isolates (32 K. pneumoniae isolates, 18 E. coli isolates, and 1 Citrobacter freundii isolate). The first appearance of armA was in 1997. The armA gene was carried by conjugative plasmids of replicon groups IncL/M, IncFIIAs, IncF, IncA/C, IncHI2, and Inc(unidentified) in 38, 20, 7, 9, 4, and 75 strains, respectively. The rmtB gene was carried by conjugative plasmids of groups IncA/C, IncF, and IncI1-Igamma in 43 strains, 7 strains, and 1 strain, respectively. Transconjugants that received the IncL/M plasmid carrying armA or the IncA/C plasmid carrying rmtB showed an additional resistance to cefotaxime. Transconjugants that received the IncFIIA plasmid or Inc(unidentified) plasmid carrying the armA gene showed an additional resistance to cefoxitin and a high MIC(50) (0.25 mg/liter) of ciprofloxacin. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the dissemination of 16S rRNA methylase genes among the Enterobacteriaceae is mediated by conjugative plasmids of various incompatibility groups that confer resistance to multiple drugs, including aminoglycosides, extended-spectrum beta-lactams, and/or quinolones.
