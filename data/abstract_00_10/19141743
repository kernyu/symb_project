Retrospective analysis led to the detection of two Vibrio cholerae variant O1 strains (VC51 and VC53), which were isolated in 1992 in Kolkata from clinical cases, with identical traits to 2004 Mozambique variant O1 strains. The Mozambique O1 strains that caused a huge outbreak in 2004 have been shown to have phenotypic traits of both classical and El Tor biotypes, and thereby have been reported as variant. Our study demonstrated that two O1 strains isolated in Kolkata during 1992 were of the El Tor background as evidenced by polymyxin B (50 U ml(-1)) resistance, positivity in Voges-Proskauer reactions and sensitivity to biotype-specific vibrio phages. With the features of classical CTX prophage, localization in the small chromosome, and an absence of RS1 and pTLC, both Mozambique and Kolkata strains appeared to be identical. Furthermore, two Kolkata strains exhibited an identical ribotype to that of the Mozambique variant, displaying ribotype pattern RI that had been assigned to Kolkata V. cholerae O1 strains isolated on or before 1992. NotI pulsotype analysis indicated that these 1992 Kolkata strains along with the Mozambique variant O1 belonged to very closely related clones. Considering the chronological events, and the typical identity at the phenotypic and the genotypic level between the two O1 strains isolated during 1992 from Kolkata and during 2004 from Mozambique, we propose that some of the 1992 Kolkata O1 strains might have acted as progenitors for Mozambique variant O1 strains.
