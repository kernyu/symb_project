This study investigated the prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance and genes encoding aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in members of the Staphylococcus sciuri group. A total of 304 S. sciuri group member isolates (284 S. sciuri, 12 S. lentus, and 8 S. vitulinus) from humans (n = 34), animals (n = 133), and environmental sources (n = 137; out-hospital and hospital environment, food) were examined for their susceptibility to amikacin, gentamicin, isepamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, netilmicin, sisomicin, streptomycin, and tobramycin. The overall prevalence of resistance to aminoglycosides was low at 12.1%. Resistance to single aminoglycosides ranged from 0% to 7.2%. The aac(6')-Ie/aph(2"), ant(4')-Ia, and aph(3')-IIIa genes, either alone or in combination, were found in 16 out of 19 isolates showing resistance to nonstreptomycin aminoglycosides. Among the 22 isolates that showed resistance to streptomycin, the genes str and ant(6)-Ia were identified in 18 and 4 isolates, respectively.
