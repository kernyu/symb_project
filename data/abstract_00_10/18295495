2-Modified aristeromycin derivatives and their related analogs were synthesized to investigate their inhibitory activity against human and Plasmodium falciparum S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (PfSAHH). 2-Fluoroaristeromycin showed a strong inhibitory activity against PfSAHH selectively and complete resistance to adenosine deaminase.
