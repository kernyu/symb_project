Bovine mastitis caused by Prototheca spp. can assume high significance because of economic losses and the potential risk to public health. Studies on the susceptibility of Prototheca spp. to antimicrobials have demonstrated its high level of resistance. We report the susceptibility of bovine isolates of Prototheca wickerhamii and Prototheca zopfii to amphotericin B and nystatin, 2 antifungal agents commonly used in the control of protothecosis, and discuss the results. After subculture, minimum inhibitory concentrations of both antifungal drugs were determined using macrodilution and agar diffusion methods. The inoculum concentration was standardized by determination of colony-forming units per milliliter. Nystatin showed more efficacy than amphotericin B in inhibiting P. wickerhamii growth. In contrast, growth inhibition of P. zopfii was similar for both antifungal agents. This study demonstrates different in vitro susceptibility patterns of P. wickerhamii and P. zopfii, reinforcing the necessity for more investigation into drugs that can be used with clinical efficacy.
