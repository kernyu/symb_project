We detected the metallo-beta-lactamase gene blaIMP positive strains of the gram-negative rods (GNR) isolated in Oita Medical University Hospital between 1993 and 1999 and studied the clinical characteristics of patients infected or colonized with blaIMP positive GNR. 25 strains (20 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 5 Serratia marcescens) were detected and most of them were isolated from urinary samples after 1997. In the studies of antimicrobial susceptibility, some strains had sensitivity to aztreonum or imipenem although most of the strains showed multidrug resistance. When blaIMP positive GNR were isolated from patients, these strains were thought to have caused infection in 88% of the patients. About half of the patients were over 65 years old and had malignant diseases. Most of the patients had inserted urinary tract catheters, intratracheal tube or intravernous catheters. It was suggested that the insertion of the catheters were related to infection of blaIMP positive GNRs. Two patients were not treated with any antibiotics before the isolation of blaIMP positive GNRs although more than half of the patients were administered carbapenems and cephems. Most of strains were isolated in the same department and showed the same genotype by pulsed field gel electrophoresis.
