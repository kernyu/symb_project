Aerosolized delivery of a number of antimicrobial agents has been studied. Despite a theoretical soundness behind this strategy, full consideration of the potential toxicities associated with this mode of administration is imperative. Aerosolized amphotericin B, as both deoxycholate and lipid formulations, has been studied in a variety of high-risk patient populations for prophylaxis and treatment against fungal infections. Although available data remain inconclusive regarding the clinical efficacy of this therapy, variability among results may be due to lack of standardization of administration methods and doses. Akin to the lack of clinical consensus, data regarding the tolerability of this means of amphotericin B delivery are conflicting. This variability may again be accounted for by the lack of standardized means for aerosolized administration. Owing to uncertain clinical benefit and concern for pulmonary toxicities, the use of aerosolized amphotericin B should be limited to clinical investigations at this time.
