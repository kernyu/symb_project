Helicobacter pylori is a global pathogen that causes severe gastrointestinal diseases leading to a significant morbidity and mortality. There is an effective treatment for peptic ulcer disease, however, this is being compromised by an increase in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Although alternative rescue regimens have been advocated, the best strategy would be to prevent disease, especially in the case of gastric cancer for which there is still no treatment. One approach is to inhibit the first step in the pathogenic process - adhesion of the organism to the host tissue. Another and probably a better approach is vaccination, but clinical trials have so far been unsuccessful. There is still a large uncertainty in relation to how H. pylori causes disease. Knowledge from genomics, proteomics, and the relationship between polymorphism of the bacterium and the host, as well as the continuing investigation of the role played by important virulence factors in the outcome of the disease, will help both in understanding pathogenesis of disease and in the design of the best vaccine.
