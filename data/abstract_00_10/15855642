Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), a large DNA virus from the Herpesviridae family, is the major cause of sporadic lethal encephalitis and blindness in humans. Recent studies have shown the importance of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the immune response to HSV-1 infection. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a critical adaptor protein that is downstream to mediated TLR activation and is essential for the production of inflammatory cytokines. Here, we studied the relationship between MyD88 and HSV-1 using a purified HSV-1 isolated from a natural oral recurrent human infection. We observed the activation of TLR-2 by HSV-1 in vitro using Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with a reporter gene. Interestingly, we found that only peritoneal macrophages from MyD88-/- mice, but not macrophages from TRL2-/- or from wild-type mice, were unable to produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha in response to HSV-1 exposure. Additionally, although TLR2-/- mice showed no enhanced susceptibility to intranasal infection with HSV-1, MyD88-/- mice were highly susceptible to infection and displayed viral migration to the brain, severe neuropathological signs of encephalitis, and 100% mortality by day 10 after infection. Together, our results suggest that innate resistance to HSV-1 is mediated by MyD88 and may rely on activation of multiple TLRs.
