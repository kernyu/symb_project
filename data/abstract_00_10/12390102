BACKGROUND: The resistance of Helicobacter pylori to clarithromycin has become one of the primary reasons for eradication failure. AIM: To compare the eradication rates of triple therapy using amoxicillin (A), clarithromycin (C) and rabeprazole (R) or lansoprazole (L) against clarithromycin-sensitive and clarithromycin-resistant strains. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-five patients were randomly divided into four groups and treated for 1 week: 147 cases were treated with RAC, i.e. 49 cases with R20C400 (10 mg R + 750 mg A + 200 mg C, twice daily), 48 cases with R40C400 (20 mg R + 750 mg A + 200 mg C, twice daily) and 50 cases with R40C800 (20 mg R + 750 mg A + 400 mg C, twice daily); 148 cases with treated with LAC (30 mg L + 750 mg A + 200 mg C, twice daily). RESULTS: According to intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses, the eradication rates were 88% and 91% with RAC and 78% and 81% with LAC; the eradication rates with R20C400, R40C400 and R40C800 were 94%, 81% and 86%, respectively, in the intention-to-treat analysis. In addition, the eradication rates for clarithromycin-sensitive strains with RAC and LAC were 98% and 89%, respectively, and for clarithromycin-resistant strains with RAC and LAC were 8.1% and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The eradication rate was significantly higher with RAC than LAC. The eradication rate for clarithromycin-resistant strains was low in both groups, and an improved eradication rate could not be achieved by changing the dose of clarithromycin or proton pump inhibitor.
