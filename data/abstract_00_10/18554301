Antimicrobial resistance is a major concern in health care and farming settings throughout the world. The level of antimicrobial resistance continues to increase and the requirement for a novel and possibly dramatic change in therapy choices is required. One possible mechanism for overcoming resistance is the actual removal of antimicrobial treatment from the therapeutic armoury. This review examines the potential for success of a policy advocating the reduction of antimicrobial use and additionally the withdrawal of such treatments. Evidence from agriculture suggests that the removal of certain drugs from animal husbandry can result in concomitant falls in certain drug resistances in human patients.
