BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Increased arterial stiffness is a strong and independent predictor of cardiovascular risk in these patients. In the present study, we investigated the time-dependent effects of cadaveric renal transplantation on arterial elasticity in end-stage renal disease patients. METHODS: Thirty-six patients underwent successful cadaveric kidney transplantation. Pulse-wave analysis of the radial artery was performed prior to transplantation (day 0) and at six defined intervals after transplantation (day 1 to 90). Compliance of large conduit arteries (C1) and of small resistance arteries (C2) was assessed using a modified Windkessel model of the circulation. RESULTS: Both large artery and small artery compliance were transiently improved within the first four weeks posttransplant reaching a maximum of 122 +/- 42% (C1) and 147 +/- 93% (C2) between day 19 and 23. After the first month, however, elasticity gradually deteriorated to reach baseline values three months after transplantation again. CONCLUSION: The benefits of cadaveric renal transplantation on oscillatory and capacitive artery compliance are only transient. It may be speculated that the subacute and long-term vasoactive effects of calcineurin inhibitors counteract the metabolic benefits of increased renal function on the vasculature.
