Mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is a nonselective inner membrane permeabilization that contributes to neuronal cell death under circumstances such as brain trauma, ischemia, and hypoglycemia. Here we study the participation of MPT and the Bcl-2-sensitive apoptotic cell death pathway in glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Intrastriatal infusions of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist quinolinic acid caused massive striatal neurodegeneration in both rats and mice. Interestingly, transgenic mice overexpressing human Bcl-2 and rats systemically treated with cyclosporin A did not exhibit reduced sensitivity to quinolinic acid-induced striatal toxicity. Both Bcl-2 and cyclosporin A are inhibitors of MPT; in addition Bcl-2 also inhibits apoptotic stimuli-mediated release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors. Isolated brain mitochondria from cyclosporin A-treated rats showed resistance to Ca(2+)-induced dissipation of the membrane potential, indicating protection against MPT. We conclude that quinolinic acid-mediated striatal excitotoxicity is not dependent on MPT and Bcl-2-sensitive apoptotic cell death pathways.
