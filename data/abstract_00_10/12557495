Biological properties and sensitivity to modern antibacterial drugs 54 strains of staphylococci isolated under furunculosis have been studied with the aim to optimize this disease treatment. Staphylococcus aureus was revealed with frequency 35.2 +/- 6.50%, S. epidermidis (31.5 +/- 6.32%), S. warneri (16.7 +/- 5.08%), S. hominis (7.4 +/- 3.56%), S. haemolyticus and S. saprophyticus (3.7 +/- 2.57%) as well as S. lentus (1.9 +/- 1.86%) were identified among coagulase-negative staphylococci. Methycillin-resistant staphylococci were isolated from 25.92% of patients with furunculosis. High level of resistance of furunculosis agents to erythromycin, clarythromycine, cephtriaxon, pephloxacyne, tetracycline, doxycycline, levomycetine and phosphomycine has been registered. Basing on the study of isolates antibioticograms, cephasoline is recommended as the selected drug under furunculosis, and tobramycin as the reserve antibiotic. Autovaccine was also made for the patients treatment.
