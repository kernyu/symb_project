Efficacy evaluation of anthelmintics is very important even in veterinary practice due to the existence of acquired resistance, poor quality of anthelmintics in several region of the world, and nedds for quarantine strategy prior introduction of new animals. Clearly, flock evaluation can be opposed to individually based evaluations. I propose that individually based evaluations should be preferred in field condition controls: although they are more sophisticated on a statistical basis, the availability of a software for calculations renders the proposal realistic.
