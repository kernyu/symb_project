The in vitro antimicrobial activity of a new series of synthetic fluorine-substituted triaryl alcohols against the human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans was studied with the aim of overcoming multiple drug resistance and improving the clinical usefulness of antimicrobial drugs. The nature and positions of substituents attached to aromatic rings, as well as their electronegativities and sizes, seem to affect the preferred molecular conformations and, hence, the binding of the compounds to the corresponding cell receptors.
