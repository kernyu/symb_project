Clostridium tertium is infrequently isolated from blood in patients with underlying diseases. Laboratory diagnosis is often delayed because Clostridium tertium is aerotolerant and resistant to metronidazole. Clinically it is a problem because it is commonly resistant to metronidazole, clindamycin and cephalosporins. We present 3 cases illustrating these characteristics.
