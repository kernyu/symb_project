20-30% of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma associated with Helicobacter pylori do not regress after antibiotic therapy. Regression can be assessed only by extended follow-up. To assess whether t(11;18, q21;q21), which results in a chimeric transcript between the AP12 and MLT genes, predicts lymphoma resistance to antibiotic therapy, we screened for the fusion transcript with RT-PCR in ten responsive and 12 non-responsive gastric MALT lymphomas. The AP12-MLT transcript was detected in nine (75%) of 12 patients non-responsive to antibiotic therapy but not in responsive patients. Most H pylori-associated gastric MALT lymphomas that do not respond to antibiotic therapy are associated with t(11;18, q21;q21).
