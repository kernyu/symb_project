Although topical therapies alone can be very effective for milder acne, there are often cases for which oral antibiotics are needed to control disease. Through both antibacterial and antiinflammatory effects, oral antibiotics in combination with other drugs such as retinoids and benzoyl peroxide can be highly effective in the treatment of more severe disease. Patients and their parents often have many questions regarding the safety and efficacy of long-term antibiotic use. It is important for the physician to have a thorough understanding of the antibiotics at their disposal as well as their side effects. Through careful discussion, antibiotic compliance can be optimized and side effects minimized ultimately resulting in treatment success.
