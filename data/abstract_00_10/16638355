OBJECTIVE: To report the preliminary experience of 21 orthotopic heart transplantations without early death. METHODS: Between April 2002 and June 2005, 21 patients underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. Recipients' pulmonary vascular resistance ranged from 3.0 to 5.9 wood units [mean (4.3 +/- 1.4) wood units]; Stanford myocardial protective solution or HTK solution was perfused for donor heart myocardial preservation, donor heart cold ischemic period ranged from 52 to 310 min [mean (81 +/- 23) min]; Three patients had previous cardiac operations under cardiopulmonary bypass, conventional Stanford orthotopic cardiac transplantation in 20 cases and total heart technique in 1 case; Recipients received simulect preoperatively and cyclosporine A, cellcept and prednisone postoperatively for prevention of acute allograft rejection; Patients received appropriate medical control of hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia and uricacidemia. RESULTS: Acute right heart failure in 3 cases and pericardial effusion in 4 cases were observed at the early postoperative stage, but no any infection and acute rejection were found. All patients survived with good life quality. CONCLUSIONS: Heart transplantation may produce satisfying early results. Suitable selection of recipients with low pulmonary vascular resistance, excellent donor heart conservation, practised anastomotic technique, proper immunosuppression treatment and efficient postoperative management are key measures of orthotopic heart transplantation with excellent early outcome.
