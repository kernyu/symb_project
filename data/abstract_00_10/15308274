Antibiotics are among the most widely prescribed therapeutic agents in children. Several new trends in antibiotic usage for pediatric care have emerged. New mechanisms of antibacterial resistance have required a broader repertoire of antibiotic usage, including new agents directed at multidrug resistance. After promotion of judicious antibiotic use, there has been a decline in the number of pediatric prescriptions for antibiotics. Recent legislation addresses the necessity for pediatric clinical drug trials, ensuring development of further antibacterial agents for use in pediatric patients.
