Microcin 24 is an antimicrobial peptide secreted by uropathogenic Escherichia coli. Secretion of microcin 24 provides an antibacterial defense mechanism for E. coli. In a plasmid-based system using transformed Salmonella enterica, we found that resistance to microcin 24 could be seen in concert with a multiple-antibiotic resistance phenotype. This multidrug-resistant phenotype appeared when Salmonella was exposed to an E. coli strain expressing microcin 24. Therefore, it appears that multidrug-resistant Salmonella can arise as a result of an insult from other pathogenic bacteria.
