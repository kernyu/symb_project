The aim of this study was to examine a frequency of isolation and analysis of drug susceptibility o P. aeruginosa strains cultured from clinical specimens obtained from patients treated in specialistic outpatient clinics of the Samodzielny Publiczny Zespol Opieki Zdrowotnej (SP ZOZ) in Nidzica durin 40 months (01. 09. 2000 - 31. 12. 2003). Ninety six P. aeruginosa strains were cultured out of 829 clinical samples collected from ambulatory patients and processed in the Bacteriological Laboratory of SP ZOZ in Nidzica during over three years. P. aeruginosa strains were isolated from 11.6% of examined specimens. The greatest number of strains (49.0%) were cultured from urine samples obtained from children. Identification of strains was performed using biochemical tests (Becton Dickinson, Emapol, bio-Merieux). Susceptibility of strains to antimicrobial agents was determined with disc diffusion method according to NCCLS recommendations. Special tests were applied to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). The most active in vitro against isolated P. aeruginosa strains was a carbapenem - imipenem. All strains were susceptible to this antibiotic. Ciprofloxacin (94.8% of susceptible strains), ceftazidime (89.6%), gentamicin (86.5%), piperacillin (84.4%) and aztreonam (76.0%) were active against the majority of P. aeruginosa strains isolated from ambulatory patients. Six strains (6.25% of all strains) producing extended--spectrum beta--lactamases (ESBL) were detected. It is alarming, that the majority of P. aeruginosa strains from outpatients were cultured out of pediatric samples (61.5%). Because of an increase in resistance and appearance of new mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics/chemotherapeutics in P. aeruginosa strains, it is necessary to monitor a drug susceptibility of these strains causing infections in ambulatory patients.
