AIMS: To compare the antimicrobial resistance, serotypes and flagellin gene types of Campylobacter isolated from humans and food-producing animals and thereby facilitate elucidation of the origin of Campylobacter causing human infection in Japan. METHODS AND RESULTS: The MIC values of ampicillin, dihydrostreptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, oxytetracycline, nalidixic acid and enrofloxacin for Campylobacter isolated from humans (134 isolates), cattle (38 isolates), pigs (69 isolates), layers (84 isolates) and broilers (51 isolates) were compared. The MIC(90) values of ampicillin for Campylobacter jejuni isolates from poultry were higher than those from humans and cattle. Campylobacter coli that was resistant to dihydrostreptomycin and erythromycin was observed at a higher frequency in humans and pigs than in poultry. The restriction fragment profiles of flaA of human, bovine and broiler isolates were analysed by clustering, and the isolates were classified into five clusters. Cluster I contained only human and bovine isolates. Clusters III, IV and V contained human, bovine and broiler isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Campylobacter isolates from humans included isolates that exhibited characteristics identical to those of the bovine, porcine and poultry isolates. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In addition to poultry, cattle and pigs are believed to be sources of campylobacteriosis in Japan.
