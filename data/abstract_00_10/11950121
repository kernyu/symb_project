This retrospective study sought to determine the characteristics of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections in patients younger than 18 years without known risk factors who were treated at a teaching hospital in central Taiwan. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected from medical charts. Possible risk factors included hospitalization within the past 6 months, transfer from other hospitals or nursing homes, and having underlying illness. A total of 173 isolates of community-acquired S. aureus were analyzed. Seventeen (9.8%) of these 173 isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus collected from patients without risk factors, 31 (17.9%) were methicillin-resistant S. aureus from patients with risk factors, and the other 125 (72.3%) were methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Most isolates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus collected from patients without risk factors (14/17, 82.4%) were obtained from the infected wounds of skin or soft tissues. Only 4 (23.5%) in 17 patients with isolates resistant to methicillin were prescribed antimicrobial therapy with glycopeptides. Nevertheless, all patients recovered without any long-term sequelae. These results highlight the fact that community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections occur frequently in Taiwan among patients who have no established risk factors for this infection.
