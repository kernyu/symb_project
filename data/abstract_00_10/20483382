Trichomonas vaginalis is an important human parasite of the urogenital tract. Jasmonates are a group of small lipids that are produced in plants and function as stress hormones. Naturally occurring methyl jasmonate (MJ) has been used to treat several types of cancer cells and it is cytotoxic to protistan parasites. It has been suggested that mitochondria are the target organelles of jasmonates. Here, we tested this drug against T. vaginalis. Although metronidazole has been the drug of choice for trichomoniasis, side effects from this treatment are common, and nausea and dizziness have been reported in up to 12% of patients. In addition, there has been increased recognition of resistance to metronidazole. We demonstrate here using flow cytometry, JC-1 and scanning and transmission electron microscopy that MJ induced the cell death of T. vaginalis parasites. Our results are discussed with previous findings published by others.
