Resistance of Listeria monocytogenes to reactive oxygen radicals may facilitate its survival in phagocytic cells and against some oxidizing sanitizers. The aim of this study was to investigate the function of the 2-cys peroxiredoxin (Prx) homologue in L. monocytogenes, particularly its survival in a hydrogen peroxide-containing environment. An in-frame prx deletion mutant and a complementation strain were constructed and evaluated for their growth and survival either in media containing different concentrations (0, 15, 20, 25, 50, and 294 mmol x L(-1)) hydrogen peroxide or in macrophages. Bacterial survival in various mouse organs was also investigated after intraperitoneal administration. We found that prx-defective L. monocytogenes was sensitive to hydrogen peroxide in in vitro growth media but not in mouse organs or in macrophages, suggesting that Prx promotes survival in the presence of exogenous hydrogen peroxide but not in mammalian cells or organs.
