As part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Program, a total of 4998 strains of enterococci isolated from 1997 to 1999 were processed. The occurrence of enterococcal infections by species and site of infection was analyzed, as were the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and their resistance phenotypes and genotypes. Trends in antimicrobial susceptibility to a variety of agents (including experimental compounds) were also reported. Enterococci accounted for >9% of isolates from all bloodstream infections (BSIs) in North America. Ampicillin was active against strains from Latin America and Europe but not against those from the United States and Canada. US isolates were considerably more resistant to vancomycin (17% resistant strains in 1999) than were those from patients in the rest of the world. The highest proportion of VRE was observed among BSI isolates (81.7%). Quinupristin-dalfopristin, chloramphenicol, and doxycycline were the most active agents tested against VRE. The results of this study confirm the worldwide trend in increasing occurrence of enterococci and the emerging pattern of antimicrobial resistance among such isolates.
