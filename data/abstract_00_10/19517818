Alcaligenes faecalis is an aerobic Gram-negative, non-fermentative rod. It's saprophyte of water and soil. It may be recovered from wet places of hospital environment. It is considered as an opportunistic pathogen. The aim of this review was evaluation of occurrence in clinical samples and susceptibility to antibiotics of 72 A. faecalis strains isolated in years 2003-2008. Over 30% of strains were isolated from patients in surgical ward, 19.6% from patients in outpatient clinic and almost 14% from patients in Department of Dermatology. 70.8% of strains were isolated from purulent material samples, whereas from urine--16.7% of strains. Nearly 88% out of examined strains were grown in mixed culture together with one (26.4%), two (32.0%), three (23.6%) or four (5.6%) microorganisms. All out of strains were sensitive to piperacyline, piperacyline/tazobactam and carbapenems. Sensitivity to aztreonam was observed at 22.2% of strains and to co-trimoxazole at 57.1% of strains.
