The purpose of the investigation was to study the course of and the efficiency of treatment for new-onset infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis. Two hundred and two patients with this condition were examined. Among the 202 patients, 15 (7.4%), 49 (24.3%), and 46 (22.8%) patients had lobular, rounded, and cloud-like infiltrates, respectively. 31 (15.3%) patients had periscissuritis and 61 (30.2%) had lobitis. The extent of infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis within 1 segment was encountered in 19.3% and more frequently in the presence of rounded and lobular infiltrates; the specific process in 2 segments was detected in 24.3% of cases and more frequently when rounded and cloud-like infiltrates were observed. In periscissuritis and lobitis, the process occupied 1 lobe in 87.1 and 44.3% of cases, respectively, and 2 lobes or more in 34 (55.7%) patients. Infiltrates were located in the upper lobe in 167 (82.7%) patients, in Segment IV in 21 (10.4%), Segment IX in 6 (3%), Segment X in 5 (2.5%). The signs of lung tissue decay were detected in 140 (69.3%) persons. Decay cavities of less than 2 cm, 2-4 cm, and more than 4 cm in diameter were found in 56 (40%), 62 (44.3%), and 22 (15.7%) patients, respectively. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) was detected in 13.3, 46.9, 54.4, 70.9, and 83.6% of the patients who had lobular, rounded, and cloud-like infiltrates, periscissuritis, and lobitis, respectively. The drug-sensitive MBT population was seen in 58.4% of the patients; the drug-resistant MBT population was detected in 18.1% of the patients: in 14.3% with a lobular infiltrate, in 10% with a rounded infiltrate, in 28.6% with a cloud-like one, in 21.4% with perscissuritis, and in 15.7% with lobitis. Multi-drug MBT resistance was ascertained in 3.5% of the patients. Bacterial isolation ceased in 100% of the patients with a lobular infiltrate after 1-month therapy, in 47.8 and 52.2% of those with a rounded infiltrate after 1- and 2-month therapy, respectively, in two thirds and one third of the patients with a cloud-like infiltrate after 1- and 2-month therapy, respectively, in 45.4 and 31.8% of those with periscissuritis after 1- and 2-month therapy, respectively, and in 45.1 and 11.8% of cases of lobitis after 1- and 4-month therapy, respectively.
