Neutrophils are essential players in innate immune responses to bacterial infection. Despite the striking resistance of Legionella pneumophila (Lpn) to bactericidal neutrophil function, neutrophil granulocytes are important effectors in the resolution of legionellosis. Indeed, mice depleted of neutrophils were unable to clear Lpn due to a lack of the critical cytokine IFN-gamma, which is produced by NK cells. We demonstrate that this can be ascribed to a previously unappreciated role of neutrophils as major NK cell activators. In response to Lpn infection, neutrophils activate caspase-1 and produce mature IL-18, which is indispensable for the activation of NK cells. Furthermore, we show that the IL-12p70 response in Lpn-infected neutropenic mice is also severely reduced and that the Lpn-induced IFN-gamma production by NK cells is strictly dependent on IL-12. However, since dendritic cells, and not neutrophils, are the source of Lpn-induced IL-12, its paucity is a consequence of the absence of IFN-gamma produced by NK cells rather than the absence of neutrophils per se. Therefore, neutrophil-derived IL-18, in combination with dendritic cell-produced IL-12, triggers IFN-gamma synthesis in NK cells in Lpn-infected mice. We propose a novel central role for neutrophils as essential IL-18 producers and hence NK cell "helpers" in bacterial infection.
