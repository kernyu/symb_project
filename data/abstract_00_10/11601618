It was reported that Pleurotus ostreatus was transformed unstably using recombinant plasmids containing a hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (hph) under the control of Aspergillus nidulans expression signals, and that the plasmids were maintained extrachromosomally in the transformants. Here we report a stable and integrative transformation of the fungus to hygromycin B resistance, using a recombinant hph fused with Lentinus edodes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression signals. Restriction-enzyme-mediated integration (REMI) was also tried and increased the transformation efficiency about ten-fold.
