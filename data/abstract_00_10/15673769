We assessed antimicrobial susceptibility against 211 Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from patients with severe invasive group A streptococcal infections. Overall, 3.8, 1.4, 1.4, and 0.5% of the isolates were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, telithromycin, and ciprofloxacin, respectively, and 10.4% had intermediate resistance to ciprofloxacin. All isolates were susceptible to ampicillin and cefotaxime.
