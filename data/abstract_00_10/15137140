The progress and efficiency of different therapy regimens for respiratory tuberculosis and the genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) were clinically analyzed in 46 adolescents. The pathogen of the disease was MBT of the Beijing family in 20 patients and the individual genotype of MBT in 22 patients. It has been ascertained that MBT of the Beijing genotype (80%) was more commonly recorded in secondary tuberculosis, both MBT of the Beijing family (59.0%) and the individual genotype of the pathogen (41%) were in primary tuberculosis. When MBT of the Beijing family had been infected, progression was diagnosed as being 3 times more frequently [n = 12 (54.5%)] family than that with individual genotype infection [n = 3 (13.6%)]. Therapy regimens have been developed by taking into account drug resistance and the genotype of MBT, the degree of inactivation of GINK and bacteriostatic blood activity, their clinical efficiency proved.
