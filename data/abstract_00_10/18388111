OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine and compare the proteomes of three triclosan-resistant mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in order to identify proteins involved in triclosan resistance. METHODS: The proteomes of three distinct but isogenic triclosan-resistant mutants were determined using two-dimensional liquid chromatography mass separation. Bioinformatics was then used to identify and quantify tryptic peptides in order to determine protein expression. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis of the triclosan-resistant mutants identified a common set of proteins involved in production of pyruvate or fatty acid with differential expression in all mutants, but also demonstrated specific patterns of expression associated with each phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that triclosan resistance can occur via distinct pathways in Salmonella, and demonstrate a novel triclosan resistance network that is likely to have relevance to other pathogenic bacteria subject to triclosan exposure and may provide new targets for development of antimicrobial agents.
