Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important nosocomial pathogen in humans and is increasingly implicated in community-associated infections in people. In household pets, MRSA infections are uncommon but are on the rise, possibly because of the increased prevalence of human MRSA in the community. Clinical MRSA infections in some animals can be life threatening and difficult to treat; however, other animals may develop mild disease or only become colonized. Veterinarians should be aware of the concerns regarding MRSA and should develop an understanding of appropriate disease surveillance, diagnostic testing, and infection control in order to lessen the impact of MRSA on small animals.
