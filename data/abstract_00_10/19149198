To make a universal gene targeting vector fitting for most gene and delete positive selection gene after targeting successfully, a vector named pA2T was constructed by inserting one neomycin gene (neo) for positive selection and two same herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene HSV-tk1 and HSV-tk2 for negative selection into the vector of pGEM-3Z, and two locus of crossing-over (x) in P1 (LoxP) and two different multiple cloning sites (MCS) were inserted into two flanks of neo separately. There were eight rare cloning sites between neo and HSV-tk1 and five rare cloning sites between neo and HSV-tk2, and neo, HSV-tk1 and HSV-tk2 could be translated respectively in the pA2T. Transfection of the pA2T into goat fetus fibroblast cells with Lipofectamine 2000 conferred resistance to geneticin (G418) and resistance to ganciclovir (GAC) in the cells, which suggested the positive and negative selectable markers could express in the cells and thus the vector pA2T could be used as a universal gene targeting vector. Transformation of the pA2T into the BM25.8 expressing Cre recombinase conferred neo was deleted in the pA2T, which suggested the LoxP was active. Thus, this vector can be inserted by most gene sequences as homologous sequences and positive selection gene can be deleted after targeting successfully, which is very convenience for the production of transgenic animals using gene targeting method.
