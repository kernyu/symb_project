This study aims to compare the resistance phenotypes conferred by various genes encoding enzymes that phosphorylate erythromycin. The mph genes were cloned into Escherichia coli AG100A susceptible to macrolides and ketolides following disruption of the AcrAB pump. An 882 bp sequence containing a premature stop codon, homologous to the three other previously described mph genes and present widely among Enterobacteriaceae, was found to confer resistance to erythromycin by phosphorylation. The mph(C) gene, as reported for mph(B), also conferred resistance to spiramycin. The mph(A) gene was unique in conferring resistance to azithromycin. The four investigated genes conferred resistance to telithromycin.
