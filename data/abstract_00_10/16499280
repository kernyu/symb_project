HepDirect prodrugs represent a novel class of cytochrome P450-activated prodrugs capable of targeting certain drugs to the liver. In this review, the HepDirect prodrug concept and its use for the delivery of nucleotides to the liver for the treatment of viral hepatitis is summarized. Preclinical and clinical data for the most advanced HepDirect prodrug, pradefovir, highlight the liver-targeting capability of these prodrugs, and the potential benefit of liver targeting on drug efficacy, safety and viral resistance.
