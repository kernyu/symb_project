We report the case of an HIV-2-infected patient with severe immunosupression despite undetectable plasma HIV-2 RNA. This immunovirological discordance was due to failure of the viral load assay and infection by an unknown HIV-2 subtype. Treatment was probably suboptimal, leading to the selection of several resistance mutations and treatment failure.
