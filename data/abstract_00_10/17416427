Hepatitis B virus infected patients on long-term lamivudine treatment are exposed to a 15-32% risk compounded annually of developing resistance mutations. Such resistance results in a progression of the liver damage caused by chronic hepatitis B, and may also impair the effect of other antivirals through cross-resistance. At present lamivudine is used frequently as monotherapy because of its relatively low price and negligible side effects. Thus, simple methods for identifying resistance mutations are required. A method based on real-time polymerase chain reaction with TaqMan chemistry is described. The method combines both primer specificity, in order to target wild type and mutant viral strains at codon 180, and a mixture of three minor groove binding probes distinguishing the YMDD wild type and the YVDD and YIDD variants at codon 204. The accuracy of the method was verified by concordance with results of direct sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism when examining 27 samples from five patients, in whom lamivudine resistance was known to have developed. This method is rapid, cost effective, and should prove useful for monitoring patients treated with lamivudine.
