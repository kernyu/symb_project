A defined human microbiota-associated (HMA) mouse model in BALB/c and immunodeficient Tgepsilon26 mice was used to assess the ability of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria to enhance colonization resistance to gastrointestinal (GI) tract pathogens. Probiotic bacteria (1x10(8) colony forming unit (CFU)/mL) successfully excluded Campylobacter jejuni from both strains of mice 7 days after challenge. The probiotic bacteria also reduced the number of Salmonella in the large intestines of both mouse strains. The nylon wool fractionated spleen lymphocyte populations were incubated with Salmonella or C. jejuni antigens. The probiotic treatments did not affect lymphocyte proliferation to C. jejuni antigens, but significantly increased proliferation of lymphocytes to Salmonella antigens by 68 and 55%, respectively, over untreated mice. Caspase 3/7 activation was significantly reduced 33 and 38% in the T and B lymphocyte fractions, respectively, of probiotic-treated, Salmonella-challenged HMA BALB/c mice, suggesting that lymphocyte rescue from apoptosis was occurring as a result of probiotic bacteria activity. These results revealed an immunosuppressive activity by Salmonella that was inhibited by the presence of probiotic bacteria. In summary, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria competitively excluded C. jejuni from immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice and antagonized an observable Salmonella-induced immunosuppression in immunocompetent mice.
