Protection against ischemic kidney injury is afforded by 24 h of ureteral obstruction (UO) applied 6 or 8 days prior to the ischemia. Uremia or humoral factors are not responsible for the protection, since unilateral UO confers protection on that kidney but not the contralateral kidney. Prior UO results in reduced postischemic outer medullary congestion and leukocyte infiltration. Prior UO results in reduced postischemic phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal stress-activated protein kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2), p38, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 4 (MKK4), and MKK3/6. Very few cells stain positively for proliferating cell nuclear antigen after obstruction, indicating that subsequent protection against ischemia is not related to proliferation with increased numbers of newly formed daughter cells more resistant to injury. UO increases the expression of heat shock protein (HSP)-25 and HSP-72. The increased HSP-25 expression persists for 6 or 8 days, whereas HSP-72 does not. HSP-25 expression is increased in the proximal tubule cells in the outer stripe of the outer medulla postobstruction, prior to, and 24 h after ischemia. In LLC-PK(1) renal epithelial cells, adenovirus-expressed human HSP-27 confers resistance to chemical anoxia and oxidative stress. Increased HSP-27 expression in LLC-PK(1) cells results in reduced H(2)O(2)-induced phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38. In conclusion, prior transient UO renders the kidney resistant to ischemia. This resistance to functional consequences of ischemia is associated with reduced postischemic activation of JNK, p38 MAP kinases, and their upstream MAPK kinases. The persistent increase in HSP-25 that occurs as a result of UO may contribute to the reduction in phosphorylation of MAPKs that have been implicated in adhesion molecule up-regulation and cell death.
