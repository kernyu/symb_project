1. Commercially available nucleic acid amplification assays (eg, polymerase or ligase chain reaction) are now the "gold standard" tests for genital chlamydial infection and also have a role in screening for gonococcal infection. 2. Single-dose oral antibiotics are available for treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas vaginalis infections. 3. Strains of N. gonorrhoeae in urban Australia are often penicillin resistant, while strains from South East Asia and those in homosexually active men may show high-level resistance to quinolones. 4. Imiquimod, a novel immune-response modifier, is now available for effective, safe, self-administered treatment of genital warts. 5. The Pap smear remains the cornerstone of screening for precursor lesions of cervical cancer, but human papillomavirus genotyping may have a role in clinical decision-making for women with equivocal or early precancerous lesions. 6. Treatment of primary genital herpes changes the clinical course, and long-term suppressive therapy is effective for those with multiple recurrences. New technologies have made diagnosis and screening easier for patients and clinicians
