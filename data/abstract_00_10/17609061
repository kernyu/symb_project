Tuberculosis control is hampered by the widespread increase in multidrug resistance. Rapid drug susceptibility testing would greatly aid in the adequate treatment of the disease. This study evaluates the usefulness of the colorimetric method using Alamar Blue for the rapid detection of resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid in 63 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Peru. Results obtained by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and measures of gain in certainty showed greater diagnostic accuracy than with the gold standard, the proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium.
