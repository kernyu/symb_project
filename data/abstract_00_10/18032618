Two percent of 1,973 pneumococcus strains isolated from carriers since 2001 in Portugal were found to be optochin resistant. These strains belonged to eight serotypes (and some were nontypeable), and they had diverse genetic backgrounds. Novel optochin-resistant lineages were detected over time, suggesting that there was a continuous, although sporadic, emergence of optochin resistance.
