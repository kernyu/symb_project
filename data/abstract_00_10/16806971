The Mx response was compared in parr and post-smolt Atlantic salmon following intra-peritoneal injection of the same dose of Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus (IPNV) per g of fish. Mx gene expression, measured by quantitative RT-PCR in liver, showed a maximum level 3days after injection in parr with undetectable levels on day 7. In post-smolts, similar levels as in parr were attained on day 3, but levels then continued to rise on day 5 and 7 to about 10 times higher than the peak level in parr. Poly I:C injected parr showed Mx levels similar to IPNV injected post-smolts. Mortality from IPN in post-smolts occurred on days 6 and 7. Levels of IPN VP2 transcripts in parr were very low and did not increase with time, suggesting viral replication was low. Individual variation in levels of Mx and IPN VP2 gene transcripts was very high in post-smolts and although data is limited there was an inverse relationship between the levels of Mx and VP2, suggesting that individuals with high Mx levels on day 5 may be able to prevent viral replication. This contrasts with the response in parr, where IPN-resistance was not associated with a high Mx response.
