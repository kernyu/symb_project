Several important aspects of the antimicrobial resistance problem have not been treated extensively in previous monographs on this subject. This section very briefly updates information on these topics and suggests how this information is of value in assessing the contributions of human and agricultural use of antimicrobial agents on the problem of increasing antimicrobial resistance. The overall themes are (1) that propagation of resistance is an ecological problem, and thus (2) that ameliorating this problem requires recognition of long-established information on the commensal microbiota of mammals, as well as that of recent molecular understanding of the genetic agents involved in the movement of resistance genes.
