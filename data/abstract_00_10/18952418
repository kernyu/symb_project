The raise in clinical significance of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens has directed us to synthesize 2,6-diarylpiperidin-4-one and Delta(3)-tetrahydropyridin-4-ol based benzimidazole and O-arylsulfonyl derivatives. X-ray crystal structure of tetrahydropyridinol (23) confirmed a change in conformation and orientation of substituents upon amide formation. Antibacterial activities evaluated against a wide number of bacterial pathogens (both sensitive and multidrug-resistant) revealed that 19, 27 against Staphylococcus aureus, 27 against Enterococcus faecalis, and 19, 21, 23, and 27 against Enterococcus faecium are significantly good at lowest MIC(90) (16 microg/mL). Inhibitory power noticed by 23 against Vancomycin-Linezolid-resistant E. faecalis and 27 against Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium are onefold better than the standard Linezolid and Trovafloxacin drugs, respectively. Moreover, antitubercular activity for the selected compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv revealed that compounds 23, 24, and 27 expressed onefold improved potency compared to the standard Rifampicin drug.
