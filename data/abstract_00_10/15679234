OBJECTIVE: The authors wanted to assess the level of Streptococcus pneumoniae antibiotic resistance in Ile de France. METHOD: In 2001, 637 clinical strains of S. pneumoniae were prospectively collected from 32 microbiology laboratories. RESULTS: Fifty one percent of strains were isolated from children under 15 years of age and 49% from adults. In children, 76% of strains came from otitis media, 20% from blood culture, in adults most strains (92%) came from blood culture. The overall prevalence of non-susceptible penicillin pneumococci was 61% higher in children (73%) than in adults (50%). Among the non-susceptible penicillin pneumococci 21.8% were resistant (CMI > 1 mg/l). Strains with decreased susceptibility to amoxicillin and cefotaxime were 38% and 17% respectively. Resistant strains to these two drugs (CMI > 2 mg/l) were rare 2.6% and 0.4% respectively. Among other antimicrobial agents, rate of resistance was 63% to erythromycin, 47% to cotrimoxazole, 40% to tetracycline, and 23% to chloramphenicol. The most frequent serogroups were serogroups 19 and 14, respectively 23% and 18%. Serotypes included in heptavalent vaccine covered 90% of children strains under 2 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of resistance to penicillin was high in children particularly in otitis media pus (76%).
