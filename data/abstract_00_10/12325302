Effect of salicylic acid and Fusarium moniliforme on trypsin inhibitor activity, lectine activity, lectine carbohydrate specificity, and salicylic acid content in sprouted maize was studied. Changes in trypsin inhibitor activity, lectine activity, and content of endogenous salicylic acid during action of exogenous salicylic acid or pathogen were shown to depend on resistance of maize lines to fusariosis pathogen. Salicylic acid was proposed to take part in induction of trypsin and lectine inhibitors. Trypsin and lectine inhibitors are important in formation of sprouted maize resistance to abiotic and biotic factors.
