The synergism of voriconazole (VRC) and terbinafine was studied by using 39 genotypically defined clinical Candida albicans isolates that were cross-resistant to fluconazole and VRC and serial isolates that gradually developed azole resistance. Synergy was noticed in 100% (eight of eight) of the strains that were resistant to VRC. Antagonism was not observed.
