PURPOSE: To evaluate the utility of Etest in choosing the appropriate treatment of fungal keratitis. METHODS: Etest was used to determine the drug sensitivities of isolates from the eyes of three patients with fungal keratitis, and the clinical outcomes of treatment with selected drugs were evaluated. RESULTS: In all cases, drug sensitivity demonstrated by Etest accorded with clinical efficacy of the drugs. CONCLUSION: The results in these cases suggest that evaluating drug sensitivities with Etest is an efficient means of selecting optimal pharmacotherapy for fungal keratitis.
