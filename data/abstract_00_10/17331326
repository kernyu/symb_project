Historically, limited trials evaluating biotherapy in treating metastatic neuroendocrine tumours have yielded mixed results. In this study, the efficacy of a novel combination therapy featuring longacting Sandostatin LAR plus alpha-interferon was evaluated. In a prospective case series, 12 patients with unresectable metastatic neuroendocrine tumours refractory to treatment initiated therapy with Infergen and Sandostatin LAR. Radiological response was followed serially at 3-month intervals. A biochemical response was considered significant if marker levels decreased by > or = 50% compared with baseline. Inhibition of tumour growth lasting for greater than 3 months (mean response 22.6+/-17.7 months) was seen in eight patients. Complete tumour regression was observed in one patient, lasting for 40 months; three patients exhibited partial tumour regression (mean response 29.3+/-24.0 months), and four patients maintained a stable tumour response (mean response 13.3+/-9.2 months). Four patients showed no response to therapy (mean response 5.0+/-6.0 months). All enrolled patients are alive currently. The biochemical response seen in seven patients did not correlate with the radiological response. These results suggest that the novel combination of longacting Sandostatin LAR with an alpha-interferon may be at least as effective as either combination therapy with short-acting octreotide or monotherapy with Sandostatin LAR.
