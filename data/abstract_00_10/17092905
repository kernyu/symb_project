A case of fatal salmonellosis in a Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) from Bursa Province (northwestern Turkey) is described. The organs of the bird were examined histopathologically and microbiologically. Macroscopic and microscopic findings were consistent with a Salmonella infection. Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) phage type (PT) 21b was isolated from the liver and spleen in pure culture and from the intestine. The isolate was susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. This is the first report of an isolation of salmonellae from a wild bird species from Turkey and the first time S. Enteritidis PT21b has been reported from Turkey.
