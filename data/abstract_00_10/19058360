The results of 5 prospective trials were studied with metaanalysis. The trials investigated correlations between uropathogens resistance in vitro to sulphomethoxasol/trimethoprim or trimethoprim and clinical/bacterial efficacy of these drugs. In detection of a resistant uropathogen the rate of eradication of uropathogens decreases 1.81 fold (CI 1.55-2.12; p < 0.00001), of a persistent bacteriological response 1.29 fold (CI 1.12-1.49; p = 0.0004), of recovery--1.65 fold (CI 1.44-1.89; p < 0.00001), persistent clinical response--1.42 fold (CI 1.16-1.74; p < 0.0005). At present, correlation between uropathogens resistance in vitro and efficacy of antibacterial treatment of urinary infection can be estimated only for co-trimoxasol the efficacy of which in urinary infections caused by resistant uropathogens falls 1.2-1.8 fold while 45.3% patients demonstrate bacteriological and 53.2%--clinical response to therapy. Further studies are needed for estimation of the above correlations for other groups of antibacterial drugs.
