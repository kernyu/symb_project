In Corrientes (Argentina), from January 2004 to April 2005, fecal samples from under 5 years-old children with acute diarrhea were collected; the stool samples were cultured onto selective media, and those colonies suspected to be Salmonella, Vibrio, Aeromonas, Shigella, or Escherichia coli O157 were identified. The antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by the disk diffusion method. Among 590 samples, the 7.7% were positive (Salmonella spp 32.6% and Shigella spp 67.4%). Of 31 Shigella isolates, 81% were S. flexneri, and 19% were S. sonnei. S. flexneri serotype 2 was the more frequent. S. flexneri strains showed higher multidrug resistance than S. sonnei strains. Among the Salmonella enterica serotypes, S. typhimurium and S. newport were the most frequent. Two isolates of Salmonella presented with multidrug resistance. This paper was a contribution to the knowledge of bacterial gastroenteritis etiology in our region and it called the attention to the emergence of multidrug-resistant enteropathogenic strains.
