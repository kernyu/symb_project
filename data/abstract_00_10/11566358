A comprehensive set of bicyclomycin-resistant mutants of transcription termination protein Rho has been characterized in Escherichia coli by in vivo and in vitro assays. Several of the mutant Rho proteins have functional defects. Strains with either the L208R or the S266A mutation in the bacterial chromosome have a higher intracellular concentration of the Rho protein than strains containing a wild-type copy of the rho gene. Strains carrying the L187R, L208R or S266A mutations in the chromosome also have a mutant phenotype; a plasmid-located arabinose promoter is constitutively de-repressed in these strains. The L208R and S266A mutant strains also have a rate of growth defect. When the S266A mutation is located on a high-copy plasmid, the mutant grows more slowly than a wild-type strain. In contrast to the majority of the bicyclomycin-resistant mutants, these two mutants show clear phenotypic differences from wild-type cells. These differences are also seen in vitro. In vitro transcription termination by RhoL208R and RhoS266A is defective at the lambda tR1 terminator, but can be enhanced by NusG. These functionally defective Rho mutations have been located near the putative catalytic site on a model of Rho based on the F1-ATPase. This indicates that this region of the Rho molecule is crucial for Rho function. The crucial region overlaps the putative bicyclomycin-binding site, suggesting an explanation for the efficacy of bicyclomycin as an antibiotic.
