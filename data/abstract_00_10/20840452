AIMS: This study aimed to identify differentially overexpressed membrane-enriched as well as cytosolic proteins in SAG sensitive and resistant clinical strains of L. donovani isolated from VL patients which are involved in the drug resistance mechanism. METHODS: The proteins in the membrane-enriched as well as cytosolic fractions of drug-sensitive as well as drug-resistant clinical isolates were separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and overexpressed identified protein spots of interest were excised and analysed using MALDI-TOF/TOF. RESULTS: Six out of 12 overexpressed proteins were identified in the membrane-enriched fraction of the SAG resistant strain of L. donovani whereas 14 out of 18 spots were identified in the cytosolic fraction as compared with the SAG sensitive strain. The major proteins in the membrane-enriched fraction were ABC transporter, HSP-83, GPI protein transamidase, cysteine-leucine rich protein and 60S ribosomal protein L23a whereas in the cytosolic fraction proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), proteasome alpha 5 subunit, carboxypeptidase, HSP-70, enolase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, tubulin-beta chain have been identified. Most of these proteins have been reported as potential drug targets, except 60S ribosomal protein L23a and PCNA which have not been reported to date for their possible involvement in drug resistance against VL. CONCLUSION: This study for the first time provided a cumulative proteomic analysis of proteins overexpressed in drug resistant clinical isolates of L. donovani indicating their possible role in antimony resistance of the parasite. Identified proteins provide a vast field to be exploited for novel treatment strategies against VL such as cloning and overexpression of these targets to produce recombinant therapeutic/prophylactic proteins.
