A new series of functionalized 1,2,4-trioxanes 10-21 have been prepared and assessed for antimalarial activity in mice. Several of these trioxanes show significant activity. Trioxane 16, the most active compound of the series, has shown activity by oral route which is comparable with that of the clinically used drug, beta-arteether.
