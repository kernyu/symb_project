Cytomegalovirus encephalitis occurs rarely in transplant recipients. We describe a patient with cytomegalovirus ventriculoencephalitis who had a very high CSF viral load but a low peripheral blood viral load. No resistance mutations were present in cerebrospinal fluid viral DNA, whereas DNA from blood showed a resistance mutation in the UL54 gene but not in the UL97 gene. Viral replication was intense in the brain ependyma and periventricular areas without evidence of peripheral cytomegalovirus disease. The data provide evidence for compartmentalization of cytomegalovirus infection. Levels of ganciclovir and foscarnet in the cerebrospinal fluid may be inadequate for treatment, even for some drug-susceptible strains, and, together with periventricular replication, may explain the disparity between cerebrospinal fluid viral load and peripheral blood viral load.
