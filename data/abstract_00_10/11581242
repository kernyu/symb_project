We compared antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 206 group B streptococcal (GBS) strains isolated from pregnant women and six from neonates/infants with invasive infection during the two periods 1985-1986 and 1999-2000. All strains in both periods were susceptible to the penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenem tested. Seven (3%) isolates were resistant to erythromycin and three (1%) were resistant to clindamycin. There were no significant differences between the two study periods in the incidence of GBS resistant to the 14 antibiotics tested. These results showed that penicillins are still the first choice to prevent vertical transmission of GBS in Japan.
