A group of 72 pneumococcal isolates resistant or intermediate to levofloxacin and 124 pneumococcal isolates susceptible to fluoroquinolones were tested by the VITEK 2 instrument using investigational test cards and by a broth microdilution reference method. The VITEK 2 instrument performed well, detecting 52 of 60 (86.7%) gatifloxacin-resistant isolates and 22 of 23 moxifloxacin-resistant isolates, and did not falsely classify any susceptible isolates as resistant.
