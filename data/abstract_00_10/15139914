AIMS: To determine the species, bio-sero-phagetypes, antimicrobial drug resistance and also the pathogenic potential of 144 strains of Yersinia spp. isolated from water sources and sewage in Brazil. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 144 Yersinia strains were characterized biochemically, serologically and had their antibiotic resistance and phenotypic virulence markers determined by microbiological and serological standard techniques. The Y. enterocolitica strains related to human diseases were also tested for the presence of virulence genes, by the PCR technique. The isolates were classified as Y. enterocolitica, Y. intermedia, Y. frederiksenii, Y. kristensenii and Yersinia biochemically atypical. The 144 isolates belonged to various bio-serogroups. Half of the strains showed resistance to three or more drugs. The Y. enterocolitica strains related to human diseases exhibited phenotypic virulence characteristics and virulence genes. CONCLUSIONS: Water from various sources and sewage are contaminated with Yersinia spp. in Brasil. Among these bacteria, virulent strains of Y. enterocolitica were found, with biotypes and serogroups related to human diseases. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first documented description of the occurrence of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica in water sources and sewage in Brazil. The occurrence of virulence strains of Y. enterocolitica shows that the environment is a potential source of human infection by this species in this country.
