The prevalence and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance of Helicobacter pylori have not yet been investigated in Uruguay. The objective of this study was to assess the susceptibility of H. pylori to the most frequently used antibiotics and to determine the mechanism of resistance to clarithromycin. Seventy-nine isolates were obtained from gastric biopsies of 50 adult patients during two periods, 2001 and 2006. The former group enrolled the general population (GP), the latter group Afro-descendant (AD) subjects. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of clarithromycin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, metronidazole, and levofloxacin were determined using the E-test technique. Amplification was achieved through PCR and nucleic acid sequencing to detect mutations in the site of action of clarithromycin in the rRNA gene 23S. No amoxicillin or tetracycline-resistant strains were found. Clarithromycin resistance was found in 12% of the patients overall: 19.4% resistance in AD patients and no resistance in the GP group. This difference was statistically significant. The highest resistance was seen with metronidazole (36%), present in similar proportions in the two groups: 36.8% (GP) and 35.5% (AD). One GP patient and one AD patient had levofloxacin-resistant strains. Sequencing analysis of gene 23S rRNA showed that only mutation in position 2143 was presented in all clarithromycin-resistant strains.
