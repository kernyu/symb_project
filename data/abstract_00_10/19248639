The investigation was performed in three phases and included all patients hospitalized at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases of the Clinical Center of Vojvodina. The first phase comprised retrospective evaluation of the total antibiotic use in therapy of all bacterial infections during a three-month period in 2006/2007. A total cost of all spent antibiotics was calculated, and a daily dose per 100 clinical day care was defined In the second phase, the structure of bacterial causes and their resistance to standard antimicrobial therapy was established for all isolated strains at the Clinic for infectious diseases. According to the the results of bacterial resistance surveilance, guidelines for initial adequate antimicrobial therapy were made (regarding localization and type of bacteria) considering resistance maps for isolated bacterial strains. The guidelines took into consideration all essential elements: pharamcotherapeutic/pharmacoeconomic principles, bacterial resistance, patterns of antimicrobial prescriptions and lowest therapy costs. In the third phase, (three-month period in 2007/2008), the guidelines were implemented in therapy of bacterial infections. In this period, only by implementing the guidelines for initial adequate antimicrobial therapy, the therapy costs savings were 1275576.9 dinars (33.9%) at the Clinic for Infectious Diseses, compared to the period before implementation of the guidelines. Pharmacoeconomic investigations should become standard part of the health system in our country.
