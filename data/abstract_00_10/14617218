Review of the recently published data on Helicobacter pylori management highlights various interesting aspects. Current H. pylori eradication guidelines generally suggest a noninvasive 'test and treat' strategy for all dyspeptic patients with certain age limits depending on the local gastric neoplasia risk. According to the 'Maastricht 2-2000 Consensus Report' treatment should be thought of as a 'package' considering first- and second-line eradication therapies together. Various centres have published their results using novel antimicrobial formulations and 'rescue' and 'sequential' therapies. Review suggests that care at the specialist level remains a challenge and guidelines are deficient particularly as regards the selection and duration of eradication therapies. Results indicate that differences for CYP2C19 genotype and the selection of proton pump inhibitors have no significant role in determining eradication rates whereas antibiotic resistance and socio-economic factors play a variable role according to different geographical areas. Compliance remains an important factor in determining clinical outcome at the primary and secondary levels worldwide.
