AIM: To investigate the spectrum of gram-negative agents causing acute and recurrent cystitis in outpatients and sensitivity of uropathogenic E. coli to antibacterial drugs; to compare drug resistance of uropathogenic E. coli isolated in Russia and other countries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The spectrum of gram-negative bacteria was identified in 299 cases of acute and recurrent cystitis in Moscow, Smolensk and Novosibirsk. 271 E. coli uropathogenic strains were examined according to CA-SFM and NCCLS criteria for sensitivity to ampicilline, gentamycin, trimetoprim, co-trimoxasol, nitrofurantoine, nalidixic acid, pipemidine acid, norfloxacine, ciprofloxacine, nitroxoline. RESULTS: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris caused acute and recurrent cystitis in 90.6, 6.4, 1, 1.7, 0.3% of the examinees, respectively. For Moscow relative agents were: E. coli (80.8%), K. pneumoniae (13.1%), K. oxytoca (2.3%), P. mirabilis (3.1%), P. vulgaris (0.7%). In Smolensk E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis were isolated in 96.3, 2.5 and 1.2%, respectively. E. coli occurred in 100% of Novosibirsk cases. Mean Russian values of the resistance to ampicilline, gentamycin, trimetoprim, co-trimoxasol, nitrofurantoin, nalidixic acid, pipemidine acid, norfloxacine, ciprofloxacine, nitroxoline were the following: 33.3, 5.9, 20.3, 18.4, 2.9, 5.5, 4.4, 2.6, 2.6 and 94.1%, respectively. Resistance to 2 and more drugs was registered in 18.4% of E. coli strains. CONCLUSION: Cystitis in women was in most cases caused by E. coli. The highest resistance among uropathogenic strains E. coli was observed to nitroxoline, ampicilline, trimetoprim and co-trimoxasole; maximal antibacterial activity against uropathogenic E. coli was shown by fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin).
