We report the antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin and netilmicin on 577 strains such as S. aureus, Pseudomonas, E. coli, Salmonella, Proteus, Klebsiella and Enterobacter. Isolation and identification were performed by standard methods. Disk diffusion tests were performed to evalute the susceptibility. The percentage resistance to ciprofloxacin for bacteria was: E. coli = 15%, Enterobacter = 13%, Proteus = 10%, Pseudomonas = 9%, S. aureus and Klebsiella = 4%. The percentage resistance to netilmicin for bacteria was: Pseudomonas = 29%, Proteus = 26%, S. aureus = 21%, Enterobacter = 16%, Klebsiella = 14% and E. coli = 5%. The antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin and netilmicin was higher than that of others antibiotics.
