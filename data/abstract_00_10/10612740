Rifampicin is a principal drug used to combat infections by mycobacteria and related organisms. Most strains of Mycobacterium are able to inactivate this antibiotic by ribosylation via an ADP-ribosylated intermediate. We found that this inactivation was inhibited by light at levels similar to those prevailing in laboratory environments. Rifampicin resistance arising from the cloned ADP-ribosyl transferase was also greatly diminished at these light levels. The cloned Rhodococcus equi monooxygenase which inactivates this antibiotic by a different mechanism was, in contrast, not inhibited by light.
