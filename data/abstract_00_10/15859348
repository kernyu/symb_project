To generate transgenic mice in which both hygromycin (hyg) and neomycin (neo) resistance genes are expressed in murine fibroblast cells (MEFs), which are required for conditional gene knock-out and screening of drug resistant ES cell clones. To construct HygR-neoR expression vector, pTK-hygR-pA and PGK-neoR-pA were cloned into pBluescript vector. DNA fragments of tandem genes ( 4245bp ) were prepared by Kpn I and Xba I digestion and transgene was microinjected into pronucleus of zygotes to generate transgenic mice. Transgenic mice were identified by PCR and Southern blot; expression of hygR and neoR gene transcripts were detected by RT-PCR. 7 founder mice carrying hyg-neo resistant genes were obtained and 6 transgenic mouse lines were successfully established. The hygR and neoR gene transcripts were detected in the liver and/or ovary of transgenic mice from hn30, hn33, hn66 and hn67 mouse lines. In MEFs isolated from the mice of line hn66 and hn30, expression of hyg and neo resistant genes was also detectable. Transgenic mouse lines expressing two anti-drug genes have been established. The hyg and neo resistant gene transcripts were detected in the MEFs of two transgenic mouse lines.
