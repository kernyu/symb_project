From January 2002 to December 2003, 12 patients in a tertiary teaching hospital in northern Taiwan had bloodstream infections caused by Citrobacter freundii. Seven of the 12 isolates were resistant to cefotaxime. Using polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing, 3 of the 7 cefotaxime-resistant C. freundii isolates were found to carry extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). AmpC beta-lactamase genes were also detected in all strains of C. freundii. All strains of C. freundii with MICs >or=4 mg/L for cefepime were positive for ESBL. Rather than performing PCR on all cefotaxime-resistant C. freundii isolates, assessment of the MIC for cefepime might be a practical way to choose between treatment with cefepime or with carbapenems.
