Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, a hereditary demyelinating neuropathy, is usually caused by overexpression of peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) due to a genomic duplication. We have generated a transgenic mouse model in which mouse pmp22 overexpression can be regulated. In this mouse model, overexpression of pmp22 occurs specifically in Schwann cells of the peripheral nerve and is switched off when the mice are fed tetracycline. Overexpression of pmp22 throughout life (in the absence of tetracycline) causes demyelination. In contrast, myelination is nearly normal when pmp22 overexpression is switched off throughout life by feeding the mice tetracycline. When overexpression of pmp22 is switched off in adult mice, correction begins within 1 week and myelination is well advanced by 3 months (although the myelin sheaths are still thinner than normal), indicating that the Schwann cells are poised to start myelination. Upregulation of the gene in adult mice (which had previously had normal pmp22 expression) is followed by active demyelination within 1 week, which had plateaued by 8 weeks. This indicates that Schwann cells with mature myelin are sensitive to increased amounts of pmp22 such that they rapidly demyelinate. Thus, demyelination can largely be corrected within a few months, but the correction will be sensitive to subsequent upregulation of pmp22.
