Caspofungin had diminished activity in vitro against Candida albicans at concentrations of 8 to 32 microg/ml. This phenomenon was markedly attenuated in a deltamkc1/deltamkc1 deletion mutant and by the addition of cyclosporine to the wild type. Short exposure to these caspofungin concentrations resulted in MKC1 up-regulation, suggesting roles of cell wall integrity and calcineurin pathways.
