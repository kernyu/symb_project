Treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been met with less than satisfactory results due primarily to its resistance to and significant side effects from alpha interferon (IFN-alpha). New classes of safe and broadly acting treatments are urgently needed. Cyclosporine (CsA), an immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drug for organ transplant patients, has recently been shown to be highly effective in suppressing HCV replication through a mechanism that is distinct from the IFN pathway. Here we report the selection and characterization of HCV replicon cells that are resistant to CsA treatment in vitro, taking advantage of our ability to sort live cells that are actively replicating HCV RNA in the presence of drug treatments. This resistance is specific to CsA as the replicon cells most resistant to CsA were still sensitive to IFN-alpha and a polymerase inhibitor. We demonstrate that the resistant phenotype is not a result of general enhanced replication and, furthermore, that mutations in the coding region of HCV NS5B contribute to the resistance. Interestingly, a point mutation (I432V) isolated from the most resistant replicon was able to rescue a lethal mutation (P540A) in NS5B that disrupts its interaction with its cofactor, cyclophilin B (CypB), even though the I432V mutation is located outside of the reported CypB binding site (amino acids 520 to 591). Our results demonstrate that CsA exerts selective pressure on the HCV genome, leading to the emergence of resistance-conferring mutations in the viral genome despite acting upon a cellular protein.
