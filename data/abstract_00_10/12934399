OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae epidemic strains in Changsha and to provide a reference for the prevention and treatment of gonorrhea. METHODS: beta-Lactamase was determined by a modified iodometric method and the susceptibility to 9 antibiotic agents was tested by the disc diffusion method in 86 isolates. RESULTS: Plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae and plasmid-mediated tetracycline-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae were 40.69% and 23.26%, respectively. Of all the 9 antibiotic agents, tetracycline, cefmetazole, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin had a higher resistance and the percentages of resistance were 45.35%, 50.00%, 62.79%, 77.91%, and 87.21%, respectively. On the other hand, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, cefepime, and spectinomycin had a higher susceptibility and the percentages of susceptibility were 77.91%, 80.23%, 86.05%, and 98.84%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Penicillin, tetracycline and fluoroquinolone can not be used as routine agents to cure gonorrhea; and spectinomycin can be used as primary medicine to cure gonorrhea in Changsha, but clinical doctors need to pay more attention to it because resistant strains have come into existence.
