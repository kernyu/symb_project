BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection persists in a considerable proportion of patients after both first- and second-line current treatments. A standard therapy for re-treatment in such refractory patients is still lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a levofloxacin-amoxycillin combination in patients who previously failed two or more therapeutic attempts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with persistent Helicobacter pylori infection were enrolled. Bacterial infection was assessed by rapid urease test and histology on gastric biopsies at endoscopy. Patients were assigned to receive a 10-day triple therapy, comprising rabeprazole 20 mg b.d., levofloxacin 250 mg b.d., and amoxycillin 1 g b.d. Four to 6 weeks after therapy, Helicobacter pylori eradication was assessed by a further endoscopy or 13C urea breath test. RESULTS: Overall, 36 patients were enrolled, but two patients were lost to follow-up. Helicobacter pylori was successfully cured in 30 patients, giving an 83.3% (95% CI=71.2-95.5) and 88.2% (95% CI=77.4-99) eradication rate at intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis, respectively. Compliance was good in all but two patients, who discontinued the treatment at 8 and 6 days, respectively, on account of glossitis. No major side-effects were reported, whilst 7 (20.1%) patients complained of mild side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a 10-day levofloxacin-amoxycillin triple therapy is a safe and successful third-line therapeutic approach for Helicobacter pylori eradication.
