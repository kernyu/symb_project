The chemical diversity of peptide and protein libraries generated from biological display systems is typically confined to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. Here, we have developed a general strategy to introduce non-natural side chains into mRNA-display libraries via specific chemical derivatization. We constructed a mRNA-display library containing 3 x 10(12) different peptides bearing a pendant penicillin moiety in a fixed position. In vitro selection using this hybrid peptide-drug library resulted in novel inhibitors of the Staphylococcus aureus penicillin binding protein 2a (PBP2a). This strategy resulted in a penicillin-peptide conjugate that has at least 100-fold higher activity than the parent penicillin itself. Our approach provides a convenient way to enhance the efficacy of known drugs and facilitates the discovery of powerful new hybrid ligands with functionalities beyond those provided by the 20 naturally occurring residues.
