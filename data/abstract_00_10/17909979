Feline calicivirus cause feline respiratory diseases, and inactivated and attenuated vaccines are available for its prevention. Moreover, the presence of vaccine breakdown strains (VBS) is problematic. In Japan, feline recombinant interferon (rFeIFN) has been used for its treatment. However the method of compare with each strains has not established. To examine the relationship between the breakdown vaccine strain and rFeIFN sensitivity, the sensitivity of 47 field isolates to rFeIFN was determined. The Log PDD(50) values were normally distributed within the range 1.1-3.7, with a mean value of 2.3 +/- 0.64. Since 68.3% of the PDD values fell in the range of the mean +/- standard deviation, the values in the range 1.7-2.9, the lower values, and the higher values were defined as representing moderate, low, and high sensitivity, respectively. Among the 15 vaccine breakdown strains, strain Fukuoka9 showed a low sensitivity, but strains ML89, T58, and N74 were highly sensitive, showing no association with vaccine breakdown. The amino acid sequence changes specific to the low rFeIFN-sensitive Fukuoka-9 strain were found, suggesting that these sites are involved in rFeIFN sensitivity.
