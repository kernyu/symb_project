400 strains of Klebsiellae identified by culture characteristics and biochemical reactions were subjected to biotyping, antibiogram and klebocin typing. Based on indole production, pectin and gelatin liquefaction 16.0% of all the isolates were Klebsiella oxytoca. Maximum sensitivity was shown to Amikacin (72%) and maximum resistance to Ampicillin (87.5%). Klebocin typability was 73.5%. So by combining biotyping, antibiogram and Klebocin typing, Klebsiella could be differentiated better than based on any single marker.
