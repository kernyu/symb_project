This study has been conducted to asses the in vitro activity of the novel triazole antifungal agent posaconazole against 123 clinically important isolates of yeasts. Susceptibility was tested using the Sensititre YeastOne microdilution commercial method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined at the recommended endpoints and time intervals. The activity of posaconazole against Candida glabrata was compared with those of fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole and voriconazole. The most susceptible species to posaconazole were C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis and C. dubliniensis. Candida glabrata was the least susceptible. The percentage of strains with MIC for posaconazole >or= 1 mg/L was 9%, all of them were C. glabrata. The species with MIC for itraconazole >or= 0.5 mg/L were 36% (41 C. glabrata, 1 C. krusei, 1 C. guilliermondii, 1 C. ciferrii). Candida glabrata strains resistant to fluconazole, ketoconazole and voriconazole were 8%, 4% and 4%, respectively. Posaconazole exhibited good activity to the majority of Candida species. However, it was similar to itraconazole and less active than ketoconazole and voriconazole against C. glabrata.
