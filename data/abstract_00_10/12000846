P1-derived artificial chromosomes (PACs) and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) have become very useful as tools to study gene expression and regulation in cells and in transgenic mice. They carry large fragments of genomic DNA (> or =100 kb) and therefore may contain all of the cis-regulatory elements required for expression of a gene. Because of this, even when inserted randomly in the genome, they can emulate the native environment of a gene resulting in a tightly regulated pattern of expression. Because these large genomic clones often contain DNA sequences which can manipulate chromatin at the local level, they become immune to position effects which affect expression of smaller transgenes, and thus their expression is proportional to copy number. Transgenic mice containing large BACs and PACs have become excellent models to examine the regulation of gene expression. Their usefulness would certainly be increased if easy and efficient methods are developed to manipulate them. We describe herein a method to make deletion mutations reliably and efficiently using a novel modification of the Chi-stimulated homologous recombination method. Specifically, we generated and employed a Lox511 'floxed' CAM resistance marker that first affords selection for homologous recombination in Escherichia coli, and then can be easily deleted leaving only a single Lox511 site as the footprint.
