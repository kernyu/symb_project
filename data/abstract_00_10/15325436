The activity of voriconazole was determined against 285 Candida species consisting of 53 resistant isolates, 43 susceptible-dose dependent and 189 isolates susceptible to fluconazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) to fluconazole were 8 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The range of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to voriconazole was from 0.0325 to 2 mg/l and the MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 0.125 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. Only 3 of 285 tested isolates had MICs to voriconazole equal to 2 mg/l. A total of 38 isolates, consisted of 3 Candida albicans, 5 Candida krusei, 7 Candida tropicalis and 21 Candida glabrata, had >/= 0.5 mg/l to voriconazole. There was correlation between the susceptibility to fluconazole and voriconazole.
