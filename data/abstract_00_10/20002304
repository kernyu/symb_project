Hepcidin is synthesized in the liver and has a crucial role in iron homoeostasis. Its synthesis is up-regulated in chronic inflammation and iron excess. We examined the determinants of serum hepcidin and liver hepcidin mRNA levels and their association with histological lesions in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and healthy controls. We studied 96 patients with CHC and 30 controls. Serum hepcidin levels were measured by an in-house competitive ELISA. Hepcidin mRNA levels were determined by a one-step qRT-PCR in total RNA extracted from liver biopsy specimens of 27 patients with CHC and six disease controls. Histological lesions were evaluated according to Ishak's classification. Serum hepcidin was significantly lower in patients with CHC than healthy controls (14.6 +/- 7.3 vs 34.6 +/- 17.3 ng/mL, P < 0.001). In patients with CHC, serum hepcidin correlated positively with aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.334, P = 0.001) and insulin resistance (r = 0.27, P = 0.016) and had a trend for correlation with alanine aminotransferase (r = 0.197, P = 0.057) and serum haemoglobin (r = 0.188, P = 0.067) but not with ferritin. A significant positive correlation was also found between serum hepcidin levels and both necroinflammation (r = 0.259, P = 0.011) and fibrosis (r = 0.214, P = 0.036). Serum hepcidin was among others an independent predictor of cirrhosis (odds ratio: 1.145, P = 0.039). Liver hepcidin mRNA levels did not differ between patients and controls and were relatively lower in patients with than without cirrhosis (19.3 +/- 21.7 vs 38.3 +/- 26.0, P = 0.067). Patients with CHC have reduced serum hepcidin levels, which correlate with worse necroinflammation and fibrosis. The previously mentioned observations suggest a viral effect on hepatic hepcidin production, but might also support its involvement in the inflammatory process.
