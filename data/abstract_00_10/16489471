A survey to determine the prevalence of anthelmintic resistance in nematode parasites of sheep against the three main families of anthelmintics (benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones and imidazothiazoles) was carried out from January 1999 to December 2003 involving 85 flocks in Northwest (NW) Spain. In the study on prevalence of resistance to benzimidazoles, faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) showed there was resistance in 8 (12.7%) flocks, 1 (1.6%) was suspected, and 54 (85.7%) were susceptible. The results indicated that 9 flocks (34.61%) showed resistance, 1 (3.85%) showed suspected resistance, and 16 (61.54%) were susceptible to the imidazothiazoles. Against macrocyclic lactones, resistance was observed in 8 flocks (15.69%), 4 (7.84%) showed suspected resistance and 39 (76.47%) were susceptible. None of the flocks used in the study showed resistance to the three families of anthelmintics. Nevertheless, six were recorded as resistant or suspected of being resistant to two of these families of anthelmintics. Egg hatch assay (EHA) and FECRT were carried out jointly on 61 flocks, although EHA was done on a total of 83 farms. The results showed that 15 (18.07%) of the 83 flocks were resistant, with egg death 50 over 0.1 microg/ml thiabendazole, and 68 (81.93%) were susceptible to benzimidazoles. When the results between FECRT and EHA were compared, both techniques showed good correlation in field studies. Faecal cultures performed pre- and post-treatment indicated that Teladorsagia and Trichostrongylus were the main genera.
