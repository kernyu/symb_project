A total of 109 enterococcal isolates from dairy food products and from human and dog infections, isolated in Portugal, and 26 type and reference strains of the genus Enterococcus were screened for vancomycin resistance. MIC values, both for vancomycin and teicoplanin, were determined. The genetic relatedness of isolates carrying either vanA and/or vanB was determined using Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis. For vanA carrying isolates, transposon Tn1546 was partially mapped using PCR. None of the 59 dairy isolates was resistant to vancomycin. Among the 50 clinical isolates, only one, carrying vanB, behaved as resistant, with a MIC value of 256 microg/mL. The type and reference strains used were susceptible both to vancomycin and teicoplanin. vanA was found in 37% of the dairy isolates and 40% of the clinical isolates. vanB was only detected in 18% of the clinical, both human and dog, isolates. PCR partial mapping of Tn1546 revealed 23 different patterns among 42 isolates. Some patterns were shared between dairy and clinical isolates. Using Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis six groups of isolates were found to be genetically undistinguishable and grouping was found to be geographically and location specific/related. No genetic relatedness was found between isolates from dairy, human and veterinary sources. These results show that an incomplete and/or unfunctional Tn1546 element may explain the absence of resistant behaviour in the studied isolates, even when vanA gene is present. Moreover, the work reported shows that both clinical (human and animal) and dairy isolates have been in contact with VanA genotype of resistance and suggest that dissemination of vanA gene has been through transposable elements, like Tn1546, and not by clonal dissemination of a resistant strain. Therefore, a national strategy should be implemented to survey both vancomycin resistance and its genetic dissemination.
