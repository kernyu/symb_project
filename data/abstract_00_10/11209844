The antibiotic-resistance both of adherent bacteria to polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and of bacteria which, although exposed to the material, had not undergone adhesion, was measured as bacterial growth inhibition area onto a plate antibiogram, according to Kirby-Bauer and using a dedicated image analyzer system. The adhesion onto PMMA induces a marked (about 30%) increase in resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics (cefamandole, cefazolin, imipenem and ampicillin) and a lower (about 15%) but significant increase to the macrolide erythromycin, to two aminoglycosides (amikacin, netilmicin) and to vancomycin, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
