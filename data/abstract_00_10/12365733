Type I interferons (IFN) establish an antiviral state in vertebrate cells by inducing expression of Mx and other antiviral proteins. We have studied the effect of Atlantic salmon interferon-like activity (AS-IFN) and poly I:C on the Mx protein expression and antiviral activity against infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) in the Atlantic salmon cell lines SHK-1 and TO. The double-stranded RNA poly I:C is an inducer of type I IFN in vertebrates. A cell cytotoxicity assay and measurements of virus yield were used to measure protection of cells against virus infection. Maximal induction of Mx protein in TO and SHK-1 cells occurred 48 h after poly I:C stimulation and 24 h after AS-IFN stimulation. TO cells pretreated with AS-IFN or poly I:C were protected from infection with IPNV 24 to 96 h after stimulation. Poly I:C or AS-IFN induced a minor protection against ISAV infection in SHK-1 cells, but no protection was induced against ISAV in TO cells. Western blot analysis showed that ISAV induced expression of Mx protein in TO and SHK-1 cells whereas IPNV did not induce Mx protein expression. These results suggest that ISAV and IPNV have very different sensitivities to IFN-induced antiviral activity and have developed different strategies to avoid the IFN-system of Atlantic salmon. Moreover, Atlantic salmon Mx protein appears not to inhibit replication of ISAV.
