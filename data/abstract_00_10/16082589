BACKGROUND: Interferon (IFN) has been reported to reduce the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis C and the recurrence of HCC after effective treatment. We examined the effect of IFNs on the proliferation and the signaling pathways of human HCC cells. METHODS: Cellular proliferation was examined by a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Activities of signaling molecules were evaluated by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Cellular growth was not significantly modulated by IFNalpha-2b or by IFN-beta, even though the HCC cells expressed the IFN receptors. However, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 was activated by treatment with IFNalpha-2b, and both ERK1/2 and AKT were activated by treatment with IFN-beta, implying a possible role in resistance to IFNs. Contrary to our expectations, inhibition of mitogen-activated ERK-regulating kinase (MEK) or phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) did not modulate the proliferation of HCC cells. Also, abrogation of the ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways did not affect cell-cycle arrest at the G1/S phase caused by IFNalpha-2b. CONCLUSIONS: IFNalpha-2b and IFN-beta activated ERK1/2 and/or AKT independently of modulating the proliferation of HCC cells and the cell-cycle machinery. A signal transduction-based approach for HCC treatment needs to focus on other possible signaling molecules besides ERK1/2 and AKT when challenged with IFNs.
