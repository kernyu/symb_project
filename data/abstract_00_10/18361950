The proliferation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the severity of nosocomial critical care infections necessitate the development of viable alternative therapies. An increase in the tolerance of MRSA to the activity of vancomycin and to the associated suboptimal therapeutic measures is of particular concern. Daptomycin, the first of a new class of antimicrobials known as the lipopeptides, is indicated for the treatment of S aureus, including MRSA, in bacteremia, right-sided endocarditis, and complicated skin and skin structure infections. Daptomycin has a novel mechanism of action, rapid bactericidal activity, and a lack of cross resistance with other antibiotic classes. Daptomycin has also demonstrated efficacy in case studies involving the treatment of osteomyelitis and involving complicated persistent infections associated with indwelling medical devices. Because of its efficacy and safety in a variety of infectious conditions and because of its rapid bactericidal activity, daptomycin is well suited as a viable alternative for patients in the critical care setting.
