Studies have shown that aerosolized aminoglycosides represent a safe and effective means of treating pneumonia due to Pseudomonas sp. Aerosolized aminoglycosides have been shown to improve clinical outcome, with less risk of nephrotoxicity relative to parenteral aminoglycosides. Apparently, less drug resistance is associated with the use of aerosolized aminoglycosides. Cost factors favor aerosolized delivery methods. The full recovery experienced by the patient in this case study suggests that aerosolized amikacin may be a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective means of treating pseudomonal pneumonia in geriatric patients. Controlled clinical trials should be conducted to further investigate this treatment regimen.
