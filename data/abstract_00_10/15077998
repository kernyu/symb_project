Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were common in samples collected from an intermittent water distribution system in Lebanon. Multiply-resistant isolates were also present and most commonly to amoxycillin, cephalexin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin and kanamycin) were the most effective, with almost all tested strains showing susceptibility to these antimicrobial agents. Both the Biolog GN MicroPlates and the API 20E strips can be used for the identification of coliform bacteria isolated from potable water, but the outcome of the identification should be viewed with caution. 51% of isolates were assigned similar identities by both the Biolog MicroPlates and the API 20E strips. The similarity at the species level was lower (33%) compared to that at the genus level (67%). The identification of Escherichia coli strains, which represented 30% of all tested organisms, showed 95% similarity in the assigned genus and species using both identification schemes.
