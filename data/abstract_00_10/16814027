The gastrointestinal nematodes are considered to be the most important group of internal parasites. Gastrointestinal parasitism is a major constraint to animal health, productivity, and profitability in grazing livestock production systems. The clinical manifestations of infection may range from no apparent effect to death. Despite years of research, assessment of production losses in many regions of the United States and of the potential impact of gastrointestinal nematode control remains to be determined.
