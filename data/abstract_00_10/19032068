This study demonstrates for the first time HIV-1 resistance mutations to all classes of antiretroviral drugs available in Algeria (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs) in treated patients at failure. Moreover, it is shown that mutations to NRTIs and PIs can be observed in untreated patients in this country where there is high HIV-1 diversity.
