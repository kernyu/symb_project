Administration of rifampicin or rifabutin in the treatment of HIV-associated tuberculosis (TB) is made rather complex by the risk of drug-drug interactions with most antiretrovirals and/or for reasons of toxicity. While in selecting the appropriate concomitant regimens the priority usually goes to rifamycins with exclusion of interacting antiretrovirals, in some circumstances the former cannot be used and anti-TB rifamycin-free regimens must be administered. We describe here the clinical course of two patients with HIV-associated TB in whom the last generation fluorquinolone moxifloxacin (found to exert significant activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis) successfully replaced rifamycins.
