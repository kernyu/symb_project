Aeromonas spp is recognized as pathogenic to humans after consumption of contaminated water and food. In the present investigation, 2,323 rectal swab samples from newborns hospitalized in Rio de Janeiro were evaluated with a view to isolating Aeromonas. The samples were collected and sent to the national reference laboratory for cholera and other bacterial intestinal infections, at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation. The swabs were subjected to enrichment in alkaline peptonated water with the addition of 1% sodium chloride (NaCl) and alkaline peptonated water plus 3% NaCl (37 degrees C/18-24h) and were streaked onto agar that was selective for Pseudomonas-Aeromonas (GSP Agar). Fifty-six Aeromonas strains were isolated, distributed as follows: Aeromonas caviae (42.8%), Aeromonas media (25%), Aeromonas veronii biogroup sobria (10.7%), Aeromonas hydrophila (9%), Aeromonas veronii biogroup veronii (5.3%), Aeromonas sobria (1.8%), Aeromonas jandaei (1.8%), Aeromonas schubertii (1.8%) and Aeromonas sp (1.8%). Resistance to one or more antimicrobial drugs was observed in 26.8% of the strains. Considering the importance of Aeromonas, there is an urgent need to warn about this in relation to nosocomial infection control.
