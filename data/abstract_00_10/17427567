Antiseptic and disinfectant products contain active chemical agents known as biocides. The responses of different types of microorganisms to antiseptics and disinfectants vary and result in microbiostatic or microbicidal effects. Antiseptic and disinfectant resistance can be intrinsic or acquired by mutation or acquisition of plasmids or transposons. The mechanisms of resistance to antiseptics and disinfectants include cellular impermeability, biofilm formation, efflux and mutation(s) at the target site or overexpression of the target. It is important to know the mode of action of antiseptics and disinfectants and the mechanisms of microbial resistance in order to provide more rational use and production of more effective compounds. In this review article, bacterial resistance mechanisms to antiseptics and disinfectants have been discussed.
