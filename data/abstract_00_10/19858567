BACKGROUND: Drug resistance is a major problem in Escherichia coli isolated from surgical wound infections. In this study, we evaluated relationship between phylogenicity and drug resistance. METHODOLOGY: A total of 29 multi-drug resistant (MDR) E. coli isolates of known drug resistance genes and integron profile were selected for the present study. Triplex PCR was conducted for phylogenetic classification of these isolates into four established phylogenetic groups: A, B1, B2 and D. Statistical analysis was done to determine the association of different drug resistance genes and integrons with the phylogenetic groups. RESULTS: Most of the isolates (44.8%) belonged to phylogenetic group A followed by group B2 and D (24.1% each) and group B1 (6.9%). CONCLUSIONS: There is a definitive relationship between drug resistance and various phylogenetic groups of E. coli infecting wounds. A shift towards phylogenetic group A might be observed with an increasing drug resistance profile.
