The purpose of this study was to examine whether periodontal treatment incorporating topical antibiotic therapy affects on levels of glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in type 2 diabetic patients with periodontal disease, and to explore the relationship between CRP and glycemic control. The whole intervention group (n=32), which underwent anti-infectious periodontal treatment, showed only transient reduction in HbA1c levels without any change in hs-CRP, while the control group (n=17) did not show any changes in HbA1c or hs-CRP. Multiple regression analysis of all subjects revealed that BMI and change in hs-CRP correlated significantly with the reduction of HbA1c at 6 months after the periodontal treatment. Based on the results of multiple regression analysis, the intervention group was subdivided into two groups: those in which hs-CRP levels decreased (CRP-D group), and those in which hs-CRP levels unchanged or increased (CRP-N group) (n=16, respectively), and re-analysis was conducted based upon these subgroups. In the CRP-D subgroup, HbA1c was significantly reduced at the end of the study, but it did not decrease in the CRP-N subgroup. The decrease of HbA1c in the CRP-D subgroup following periodontal treatment was significantly greater than that in the CRP-N subgroup. BMI of each group remained unchanged in this study at the end of the study. Thus, the results suggested that periodontal treatment with topical antibiotics improves HbA1c through reduction of CRP, which may relate to amelioration of insulin resistance, in type 2 diabetic patients with periodontal disease.
