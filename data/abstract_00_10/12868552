We evaluated the efficacy of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid plus amikacin (TCA) with ceftazidime plus amikacin (CFA) as empiric therapy of fever in acute leukemia in a total of 127 episodes. The overall success rate of the therapy (survival) was 93% in TCA group and 92% in CFA group. Success without therapy modifications (afebrile at 72 hours) was 39% for TCA, 31% for CFA; success with modifications was 55% and 61% respectively. Failure (death due to documented or presumed infection) was 6% for TCA and 8% for CFA. Differences were not statistically significant. The success without modifications was higher in the group of patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO) than in documented infections (DI), mainly with CFA. No differences were documented in the resistance rate and in clinical outcome during severe neutropenia (ANC <100 microl). In our experience TCA is as effective as CFA as first-line treatment in severe neutropenic patients with acute leukemia, although in both regimens patients with DI are likely to require modifications in treatment.
