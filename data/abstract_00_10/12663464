Recent evidence has shown that activation of phosphatidyinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt, necessary for insulin stimulation of glucose transport, is impaired in insulin resistance. It is unknown, however, which Akt isoform shows impaired activation in insulin resistance. Additionally, related growth factors (epidermal or platelet-derived vascular) also stimulate PI3K, but it is unknown whether production of 3,4,5 phosphatidyinositol is sufficient to stimulate glucose transport in insulin-resistant muscle. Moreover, these studies were performed in rodents, and little data exists from humans. Hence, we investigated the stimulation of PI3K and Akt-1, -2, and -3 by insulin and epidermal growth factors (EGFs) in skeletal muscles from lean and obese insulin-resistant humans. Insulin activated all Akt isoforms in lean muscles, whereas only Akt-1 was activated in obese muscles. Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 was associated with PI3K activity, which is necessary for Akt activation by insulin, and was reduced in obese muscles, and this was accompanied by decreased IRS-1 expression. In contrast, insulin- or EGF-stimulated phosphotyrosine-associated PI3K activity was not different between lean and obese muscles. These results show that a defect in the ability of insulin to activate Akt-2 and -3 may explain the impaired insulin-stimulated glucose transport in insulin resistance. Additionally, these data also show that different upstream or downstream signals may regulate the activity of the various Akt isoforms.
