Fifty-one pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types and 17 Tn1546 variants were identified among 101 Enterococcus faecium isolates recovered in three distant Portuguese hospitals. Intra- and interhospital dissemination of specific strains and Tn1546 types was detected, which might largely contribute to the endemicity of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium in Portuguese hospitals, as happened previously in other geographical locations.
