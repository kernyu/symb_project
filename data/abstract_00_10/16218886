Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of infections. Only approximately 20% of the strains remain sensitive to penicillin. Beta-lactamase stable penicillins such as flucloxacillin form the mainstay of treatment of staphylococcal infection. Meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics. Glycopeptide antibiotics are effective against most MRSA strains but, in the last few years, isolates of MRSA that have reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus) have been isolated. Some strains exhibit frank resistance to glycopeptides (vancomycin-resistant S. aureus). Infections due to these strains are difficult to treat. This review summarises the therapeutic options for MRSA, glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus. Novel therapeutic strategies such as immunotherapy and vaccines are also discussed.
