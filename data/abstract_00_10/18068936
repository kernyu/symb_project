A nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from non-tertiary care hospitals was conducted in Korea from 2002 to 2006. Resistance to almost all antimicrobial agents decreased significantly from 2003 (P < 0.01). Resistance rates to the major antipseudomonal agents, ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, and aztreonam, were 18.8%, 20.5%, 18.7%, and 19.7%, respectively, in 2003. However, they had all decreased to below 10% in 2006. The proportion of multidrug-resistant isolates that were resistant to at least 3 of 5 major antipseudomonal agent decreased from 33.5% in 2003 to 23.1% in 2006 (P < 0.05). In this study, we found a decreasing trend in resistance rates and low resistance rates in P. aeruginosa from non-tertiary care hospitals compared with those from general hospitals, including tertiary care hospitals, in Korea. Our data provide valuable information for the selection of reliable empiric therapies for P. aeruginosa infections in non-tertiary care hospital patients, including outpatients.
