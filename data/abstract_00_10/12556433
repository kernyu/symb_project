Much antibiotic prescribing is based upon irrational practice rather than scientific principles. The advent and the better understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobials are slowly leading to a change whereby antibiotics are prescribed with a better rationale. The fundamental understanding of the pharmacokinetics of the antimicrobial, for example how well it is absorbed, metabolized, distributed and eliminated from the body, should lead to an appreciation of the correct dosing interval. Pharmacodynamic factors, in particular, appreciation of the MIC of an antimicrobial for an infecting pathogen and whether time-independent or -dependent killing occurs, will also have a profound influence upon how an antimicrobial is used. This review attempts to consider these features as they apply to nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The reason for the dosing and dosing frequency of a number of agents is discussed and an attempt is made to point the way to more judicious antibiotic prescribing so as to maximize clinical efficacy yet minimize the possibility of resistance emerging during therapy.
