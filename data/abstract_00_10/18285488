Seven hundred fifty-one Escherichia coli clinical isolates collected from 140 Japanese hospitals between 2002 and 2006 were screened for the qepA and qnr genes. Two E. coli isolates (0.3%) harbored qepA, but no qnr was identified. The results suggested a low prevalence of E. coli harboring qepA or qnr in Japan.
