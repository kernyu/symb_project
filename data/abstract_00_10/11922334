One-day-of-age broiler chickens were administered a commercial competitive exclusion (CE) product and then challenged by three different methods with an Escherichia coli O78:K80 that was pathogenic for poultry and resistant to six antibiotics. Three challenge methods were used on 2-day-old broilers: direct challenge, precolonized seeder, and instant seeder. Direct challenge was accomplished by administering the challenge E. coli per os. The precolonized seeder challenge had two chicks that had received the challenge E. coli 24 hr previously, whereas the instant seeder challenge had two chicks given the challenge E. coli per os with immediate placement with the experimental birds. One oral dose of the commercial CE product significantly reduced the colonization of the small intestine, large intestine, and ceca by the highly antimicrobial resistant poultry pathogenic E. coli O78:K80 at 7 and 14 days postchallenge by all three challenge methods. The overall mean reductions in colonization were 3.0 log10 for the large intestine, 3.0 log10 for the small intestine, and 4.0 log10 for the cecum. The most severe challenge method, on the basis of the least amount of reduction of colonization of the challenge E. coli by the CE, was by the direct oral gavage at 2 days of age.
