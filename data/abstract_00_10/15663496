In December 2001, three Georgian lumberjacks from the village of Lia were exposed to a strontium-90 source from two Soviet-era radiothermal generators they found near their village. In addition to systemic effects, two of them developed severe local radiation injuries which subsequently became infected with Staphylococcus aureus. After hospitalization in Tbilisi, Georgia, the patients were treated with various medications, including antibiotics and topical ointments; however, wound healing was only moderately successful, and their S. aureus infection could not be eliminated. Approximately 1 month after hospitalization, treatment with PhagoBioDerm (a wound-healing preparation consisting of a biodegradable polymer impregnated with ciprofloxacin and bacteriophages) was initiated. Purulent drainage stopped within 2-7 days. Clinical improvement was associated with rapid (7 days) elimination of the aetiologic agent, a strain of S. aureus resistant to many antibiotics (including ciprofloxacin), but susceptible to the bacteriophages contained in the PhagoBioDerm preparation.
