We report a patient with bone hydatid disease that was refractory to both long-term daily treatment with albendazole, combined with cimetidine or administered as monotherapy ( approximately 15 years) and a relatively short course of nitazoxanide combined with albendazole (3 months). Despite continuous daily medical treatment, bone invasion and destruction proceeded. His pain and disability progressively increased.
