Children having frequent acute respiratory infections and chronic adenoiditis were given immunomodulators (ridostin, IRS-19, polyoxidonium). As a result of such prophylaxis, respiratory infections and exacerbations of chronic adenoiditis occurred in poor-health children 2-2.5 times less frequently. Their local immunity and nonspecific resistance improved. Thus, modern immunomodulators can be used in poor-health children with chronic adenoiditis to prevent acute respiratory viral infection and development of pharyngeal tonsil hypertrophy as well as to treat them.
