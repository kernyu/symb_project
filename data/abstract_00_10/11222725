Human MxA protein inhibits LaCrosse virus (LAC virus; family Bunyaviridae) replication in vertebrate cells and MxA-transgenic mice. LAC virus is transmitted to humans by Aedes triseriatus mosquitoes. In this report, we have shown that transfected mosquito cells expressing the human MxA cDNA are resistant to LAC virus but permissive for Sindbis virus (family Togaviridae) infection.
