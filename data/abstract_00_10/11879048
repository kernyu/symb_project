(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin degradation in water-alcohol solutions containing Fe2+ and tartaric acid was studied in the presence and absence of yeasts. On the basis of the results, yeast partially inhibited the degradation of both flavans, with much slower formation of browning products absorbing at 420 and 520 nm. In comparative terms, yeast was found to be more efficient toward the degradation products of (+)-catechin absorbing at the latter wavelength. Likewise, the presence of yeast decreased the yield of a group of colored compounds eluting at high retention times in HPLC and indicated these as important contributors to color darkening in white wines. This inhibitory effect may in part account for the resistance to browning observed over periods of several years in sherry wines subjected to biological aging under flor yeast.
