Certain Campylobacter strains harbor a transcribed intervening sequence (IVS) in their 23S rRNA genes. Following transcription, the IVS is excised, leading to fragmentation of the 23S rRNA. The origin and possible functions of the IVS are unknown. Furthermore, the distribution of IVS-harboring strains within Campylobacter populations is poorly understood. In this study, 104 strains of Campylobacter coli from turkeys, representing 27 different multilocus sequence typing-based sequence types (STs), were characterized in terms of IVS content and erythromycin susceptibility. Sixty-nine strains harbored IVSs in all three 23S rRNA genes, whereas the other 35 strains lacked IVSs from at least one of the genes. The STs of the latter strains belonged to an unusual cluster of C. coli STs (cluster II), earlier found primarily in turkey strains and characterized by the presence of the C. jejuni aspA103 allele. The majority (66/69) of strains harboring IVSs in all three 23S rRNA genes were resistant to erythromycin, whereas none of the 35 strains with at least one IVS-free 23S rRNA gene were resistant. Cluster II strains could be transformed to erythromycin resistance with genomic DNA from C. coli that harbored IVS and the A2075G transition in the 23S rRNA gene, associated with resistance to erythromycin in Campylobacter. Erythromycin-resistant transformants harbored both the A2075 transition and IVS. The findings suggest that the absence of IVS in C. coli from turkeys is characteristic of a unique clonal group of erythromycin-susceptible strains and that IVS can be acquired by these strains via natural transformation to erythromycin resistance.
