The association between fluoroquinolone susceptibility and DNA mutations coding for amino acid substitutions in the quinolone resistance-determining region was assessed with 44 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Twenty-three strains bore at least one amino acid substitution. Only seven strains with mutations were suggested by diminished susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (MIC, > or =2 microg/ml).
