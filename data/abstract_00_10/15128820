Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is an attenuated virus. MVA induces the production of IFN and Flt3-L (FL), which results in the expansion of dendritic cells (DC) and enhanced resistance against viral infections. We report on the interplay among IFN, FL, and DC in the resistance against heterologous virus after injection of neonatal mice with MVA. The induction of serum FL was tested on day 2, and the expansion of DC was tested 1 wk after treatment with MVA. At this time point the resistance against infection with heterologous virus was also determined. After MVA treatment, serum FL was enhanced, and DC, including plasmacytoid cells in spleen, were increased in number. Mice that lacked functional IFN type I and II systems failed to increase both the concentration of FL and the number of DC. Treatment with MVA enhanced resistance against HSV-1 in wild-type animals 100-fold, but animals without a functional IFN system were not protected. Transfer of CD11c(+) cells from MVA-treated mice into naive animals protected against lethal infection with HSV-1. Thus, although the increased resistance could be largely attributed to the increase in activation of IFN-producing plasmacytoid cells, this, in turn, depends on a complex interplay between the DC and T cell systems involving both FL and IFNs.
