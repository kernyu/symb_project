Vancomycin-resistant enterococci(VRE) is a worldwide threat now. Because we have lost a last resort vancomycin for enterococcal infections, and their resistant genes can be transferred to other more pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. We have only a few of optional therapeutic agents against VRE. VRE causes urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections, bacteremias, endocarditis and wound infections. Especially bacteremias caused by VRE result in high mortality. VRE infections including colonization and infectious diseases must be controlled by rapid detection of VRE, appropriate diagnosis of infections, followed by effective antimicrobial therapies and infection control measures.
