Characterisation tests were conducted to determine the feasibility of land application of the sludges produced in wastewater treatment by means of Fenton's Reagent. Physicochemical and microbiological parameters of Fenton sludges were compared to the values obtained for raw alum sludges. The Fenton sludges presented preferable characteristics such as the specific resistance to filtration (SRF), metals and pathogen content (fecal and tot al coliforms, helminth ova, and Salmonella sp.). The SRF ofthe Fenton sludges (1.55 x 10(13) m/kg) was 24% less than the alum sludge value (1.92 x 10(13) m/kg). The concentrations of fecal coliforms (0 MPN/g TS), Salmonella sp. (0 MPN/g TS), Helminth ova (22 HH/g TS) and metals correspond to the limits for biosolids of Class B for land application of the Mexican legislation. The Fenton reagent efficiently removes most of the pathogens, considered by the norms, by means of the combined action of the different stages that constitute this process. These results exhibit the Fenton reagent as a feasible treatment for generating sludges with characteristics of biosolids of Class B for land application. The preliminary results of conditioning tests show that Fenton sludges present better dewatering characteristics with regard to the alum sludge, for a dose of cationic polymer of 1 mg/g TS.
