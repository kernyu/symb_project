This study evaluated the effects of homeopathic treatment on control of Haemonchus contortus infection in sheep. Twenty lambs were randomized to three treatments: treated with the homeopathic medicines, Ferrum phosphoricum, Arsenicum album and Calcarea carbonica; treated with a conventional antihelminthic, doramectin, and an untreated control group. Fecal and blood samples were taken from each animal on days 18, 38 and 68 after start of treatment. A significant reduction in number of H. contortus larvae (p<0.01) was observed for animals in the homeopathic treatment group compared to the control group. Fecal egg counts showed negative correlation between haematocrit and haemoglobin concentrations in the homeopathic treatment group (p<0.01); however, the biochemical and immunological parameters showed better correlation, indicating that the homeopathic medicine improved vital functions. Daily weight gain in the homeopathic treatment group was superior to the control and to the antihelminthic groups, 31 and 6.5%, respectively. The cost benefit analysis confirmed that homeopathy group increases economic trend when compared with the other groups.
