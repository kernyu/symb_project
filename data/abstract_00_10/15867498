Intensification therapy adding a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) to a failing regimen has the potential to worsen the resistance profile. Sixty-six patients included in four different boosted PI intensification studies were assessed and resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes were evaluated at baseline and 4 weeks after the initiation of the intensification strategy. Only one of the 66 patients developed changes in their pattern of mutations able to generate or increase resistance to new drugs.
