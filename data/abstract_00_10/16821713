The genes coding for 4 aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes AAC(6')-APH(2"), APH(3'), ANT(4') and ANT(6) were determined in 44 Slovak clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis with high-level resistance to gentamicin (HLGR, collection 1) and 48 E. faecalis isolates with resistance to amikacin (AR, collection 2). The occurrence of spotted genes was (collection 1 vs. collection 2): aac(6)-aph(2") 81.8 vs. 8.3 %, ant(4') 52.3 vs. 81.3 %, aph(3') 50 vs. 56.3 % and ant(6) 6.8 vs. 4.2 %, the most frequent combinations of genes in the HLGR collection were aac(6')-aph(2") + ant(4') and aac(6')-aph(2") + aph(3). In contrast, the aph(3') + ant(4') gene profile was predominant in AR isolates. None of the isolates contained all four AGME genes simultaneously.
