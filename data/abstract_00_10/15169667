AIM: To study the activities of in vitro resistance to the tachyzoite of Toxoplasma gondii by murine lymphocytes. METHODS: The rat's splenocyte culture method was used to observe the effects of lymphocytes themselves and lymphocytes together with Mandelic( MA) on the invasion and proliferation of T. gondii in lymphocytes. At the same time acetylspiramycin was used as positive control. RESULTS: As compared with other somatic cells, the lymphocytes invaded by T. gondii still inhibited and killed the toxoplasma organisms in the presence of immunity, the effect safety dose of MA on inhibition of the invasion of T. gondii was not notable while the inhibition of the proliferation of T. gondii in lymphocytes was remarkable. CONCLUSION: Cell-mediated immunity(CMI) was an important factor that host resists the T. gondii infection. So, we should pay attention to improving the organism's CMI and take proper medicine so as to enhance the effect of lymphocyte's resistance to T. gondii.
