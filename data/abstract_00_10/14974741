SETTING: Five districts in Equatorial Guinea, March 1999 to February 2001. OBJECTIVES: To determine tuberculosis drug resistance among new and previously treated cases, the risk factors associated with resistance, and the mutations associated with isoniazid and rifampicin (katG, inhA and rpoB genes) resistance, and to genotype resistant strains. RESULTS: A positive culture identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was obtained in 240/499 patients. Susceptibility testing was performed in 236 strains. The overall resistance rate in new cases was 16.9% compared to 41.6% in previously treated cases. Isoniazid resistance was the most frequent (respectively 12.5% and 16.6%) in the two groups, while multidrug resistance was observed in 1.7% and 25% of new and previously treated cases, respectively. Female sex was statistically associated with resistance in new cases. Of 41 isoniazid-resistant strains, 33 (80.5%) had mutations in the inhA gene; none had mutations in the katG gene and eight had no mutations in either gene. All strains had low-level isoniazid resistance. Of eight strains resistant to rifampicin, six had mutations in the rpoB gene. Genotyping defined seven clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate resistance was found in new cases. Low-level isoniazid resistance predominated among mutations in the inhA gene, with a high percentage of clustering in resistant strains.
