The embryonation of nematode eggs has been shown to increase their resistance to anthelmintics when parasites are submitted to egg hatch assays. Nevertheless, no mechanism has been suggested to explain this phenomenon. Earlier observations by other authors showed that the biochemical composition of eggshells is altered during the embryonation of eggs. The functional consequences of these changes have not been identified. We studied the changes in membrane environment (eggshells) of Haemonchus contortus eggs during the embryonation by fluidity measurements and their effects on nonspecific mechanisms of resistance to anthelmintics. We previously demonstrated that these mechanisms imply P-glycoproteins (Pgp) belonging to the multi-drug resistance (MDR) system and that the Pgp activity is very susceptible to their lipidic environment. The results obtained here show that the embryonation induced a significant and gradual increase in eggshell fluidity which was associated with an increased resistance to anthelmintics. Differences were observed between H. contortus isolates with various levels of resistance which might result from their specific biology and/or membrane composition. The membrane environment changes could act both on the solubilization of anthelmintics into the eggs and on the efflux of these lipophilic molecules by Pgp.
