Malaria continues to be a major cause of mortality and morbidity in tropical countries. Infection with Plasmodium falciparum may be asymptomatic, cause an uncomplicated febrile illness or give rise to severe disease complicated by coma, acidosis or severe anemia. Treatment of the febrile illness with two drugs--preferably in the form of an artemisinin-containing combination therapy--is now widely recommended, both for greater efficacy and in order to delay the evolution of drug resistance. The clinical picture of severe malaria differs according to the age and immune status of the individual; treatment requires a range of supportive measures, as well as an efficacious antimalarial drug. Insecticide-treated bednets and presumptive treatment programs are increasingly deployed in malaria control programs, while vaccines are showing promise.
