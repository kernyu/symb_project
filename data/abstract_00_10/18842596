We analyzed the requirement of specific defense pathways for powdery mildew (Golovinomyces orontii) resistance induced by the basidiomycete Piriformospora indica in Arabidopsis. Piriformospora indica root colonization reduced G. orontii conidia in wild-type (Col-0), npr1-3 (nonexpressor of PR genes 1-3) and NahG plants, but not in the npr1-1 null mutant. Therefore, cytoplasmic but not nuclear localization of NPR1 is required for P. indica-induced resistance. Two jasmonate signaling mutants were non-responsive to P. indica, and jasmonic acid-responsive vegetative storage protein expression was primed and thus elevated in response to powdery mildew, suggesting that P. indica confers resistance reminiscent of induced systemic resistance (ISR).
