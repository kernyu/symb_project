Resistance to anthelmintics in nematode parasite of the digestive tract is a major concern in small ruminants and particularly in goats. One possible solution to limit the development and spread of resistance is to give treatments on a selective basis, i.e. by targeting the most susceptible animals within a flock rather than treating all the animals. In dairy goats, epidemiological studies have shown that, within a flock, goats in first lactation and the multiparous ones with the highest level of milk production were highly receptive to parasite infection. The objective of the study was to assess whether selective treatments could achieve a level of control of nematodes similar to systematic drenching. A similar experimental design was applied for two successive years. An experimental flock of 120 dairy goats was divided into two groups. All the goats from group SYS (systematic treatment) were drenched at mid-grazing season (July). In contrast, anthelmintics in group SEL (selective treatment) were restricted to the goats in first lactation plus the high producers. Overall, these treated goats represented 48% of the flock in year 1 and 66% in year 2. After treatments, both groups grazed on separate pastures. Parasitological and pathophysiological measurements were performed monthly. The results indicate a similar level of egg excretion in the two groups. The pathophysiological parameters (pepsinogen and phosphate concentrations) were also similar in the two groups, as well as the milk production for the 2 years. These results suggest that a targeted use of anthelmintics may allow efficient control of gastrointestinal nematodes whilst resulting in a predicted reduction in the selection pressure for the development of anthelmintic resistance.
