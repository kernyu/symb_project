The Australian Gonococcal Surveillance Programme (AGSP) monitors the antibiotic susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated in all States and Territories. In 2000 the in vitro susceptibility of 3,468 isolates of gonococci was determined by standardised methods. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns varied considerably between regions. Resistance to the penicillins was highest in larger urban centres and warrants close attention in those rural centres where treatment with the penicillins continues. Quinolone resistance in gonococci became more widespread in Australia in 2000. Endemic cycles of transmission of quinolone-resistant gonococci (QRNG) in homosexually active men continued in Victoria but declined in New South Wales. Heterosexual endemic transmission of QRNG increased substantially in New South Wales and the proportion of all gonococci represented by QRNG also increased markedly in Queensland and Western and South Australia. All isolates remained sensitive to spectinomycin, but a small number of isolates in a number of jurisdictions showed some decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone. Strains examined in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria were predominantly from male patients and rectal and pharyngeal isolates were common. In other centres the male to female ratio of cases was lower, and most isolates were from the genital tract.
