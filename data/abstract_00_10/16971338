Innate immunity is crucial in the early stages of resistance to novel viral infection. The family of cytokines known as the interferons (IFNs) forms an essential component of this system: they are responsible for signalling that an infection is underway and for promoting an antiviral response in susceptible cells. We construct a spatial stochastic model, parameterized by experimental data and informed by analytic approximation, to capture the dynamics of virus-IFN interaction during in vitro infection of Madin-Darby bovine kidney cell monolayers by Herpes simplex virus 1. The dose dependence of infection progression, subsequent monolayer destruction and IFN-beta production are investigated. Implications for in vivo infections, in particular the priming of susceptible cells by IFN-beta during infection, are considered.
