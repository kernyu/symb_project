OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic efficacy of IFN or oxymatrine in combination with lamivudine in patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B. METHODS: Forty patients ongoing treatment with lamivudine were randomized to three groups: group A, 14 patients with addition of IFN alpha-2b 3MU to ongoing lamivudine, daily, one month, followed by the same dose given every other day, five months; group B, 15 patients with addition of injectable oxymatrine 60 mg daily, three months, followed by oral oxymatrine every day, three months, and group C, 11 patients ongoing treatment with lamivudine alone. The HBV DNA level in serum, HBeAg seroconversion, and ALT level were detected at the end of the treatment. RESULTS: After 6 months of treatment, HBV DNA became negative in 35.73% patients treated with combination with IFN, and in 13.3% patients treated with combination with oxymatrine. ALT level was normal in 85.71% or 86.66% of patients, respectively. In none of the patients under ongoing treatment with lamivudine alone HBV DNA or HBeAg became negative, and ALT level was normal in 36.36% of patients. CONCLUSION: These data indicated that IFN or oxymatrine in combination with ongoing lamivudine therapy provided effective antiviral therapy in patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV. The addition of IFN or oxymatrine to ongoing lamivudine therapy in lamivudine-resistant patients led to significant inhibition of viral replication and improvement in liver function after 6 months of therapy.
