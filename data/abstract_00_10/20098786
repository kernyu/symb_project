Retrospective study of serotypes, phage types and antibiotic resistance of Salmonella spp isolates in the 02 Health District of Castellon, Spain (2000-2006). Strains were serotyped using commercial sera, and they were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility with automated systems. Serotyping confirmation and phage typing were performed by the National Reference Laboratory. A total of 1505 strains were isolated, with 49 different serotypes, being the most frequent Enteritidis. The most common serotype/phage type combination was S. Enteritidis phagetype 1. Of the isolates 81.6% were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid; 65.2% to ampicillin; 99.9% to ciprofloxacin; 93.4% to trimethoprim-sulphametoxazole; and 99.8% to cefotaxime. Molecular methods could be useful to complete epidemiologic studies since 25% of our isolates showed the same serotype/phage type combination. In our health district antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella is not an important problem.
