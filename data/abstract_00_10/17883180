Klebsiella pneumoniae has long been a prominent cause of nosocomial infections and outbreaks have been observed in the intensive care units and in high risk groups. We present here a brief report on an outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae which occurred in a neonatal intensive care unit in our teaching hospital. As neonates are at highest risk for acquisition of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase, infection control policies and procedures should be strictly followed to prevent such outbreaks.
