Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common and important pathogen in the critically ill. It combines environmental hardiness with genomic plasticity and is well adapted to the various niches available in the intensive care unit (ICU). Unresolved arguments over the value of dual versus monotherapy relate primarily to rapidity of killing and to the avoidance of therapeutic failure due to antibiotic resistance. Increasing resistance to conventional antibiotics means that we need to be aware of the factors that promote the success of this pathogen in the ICU, and of emerging alternative strategies. This review focuses on an understanding of the underlying issues and on the practical aspects of prescribing, particularly in the ICU.
