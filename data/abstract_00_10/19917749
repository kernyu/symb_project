Ceftobiprole is a new cephalosporin that exhibits a high level of affinity for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus PBP 2a. It was reported that ceftobiprole did not interact with a mutated form of the low-affinity protein Enterococcus faecium PBP 5 (PBP 5fm) that, when overexpressed, confers a beta-lactam resistance phenotype to the bacterium. Our results show that ceftobiprole binds to unmutated PBP 5fm to form a stable acyl-enzyme and that ceftobiprole is able to efficiently kill a penicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strain that produces this protein.
