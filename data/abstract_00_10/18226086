Complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs) are a significant clinical problem, partially owing to increasing resistance of infecting bacteria to current antibiotic therapies. Two case studies that illustrate complications that can arise when treating cSSTIs are outlined, and methods that can be used to address the problem and the final treatment outcome are detailed. Although these are specific examples, intolerance of and bacterial resistance to current antibacterial therapies are problems that are often seen in the clinical setting and must be addressed appropriately. The use of new antibiotic agents is one potential solution to these problems, and some of these agents are highlighted. Selecting the most appropriate therapy for an infection is often crucial for patient welfare. This article presents some potential approaches to the treatment of cSSTIs.
