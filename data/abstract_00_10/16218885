Impetigo contagiosa is a common, superficial, bacterial infection of the skin characterised by an inflamed and infected epidermis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes or both. The less common bullous impetigo is characterised by fragile fluid-filled vesicles and flaccid blisters, and is invariably caused by pathogenic strains of S. aureus. In bullous impetigo, exfoliative toxins are produced, although these are restricted to the area of infection and bacteria can be cultured from the blister contents. In the rare variant, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, the exfoliative toxins are spread haematogenously from a localised source causing widespread epidermal damage at distant sites.
