Plasmodium falciparum gametocytaemia was studied in 266 Senegalese children (median 4 years, range 0.5-16) with uncomplicated malaria treated with chloroquine (CQ), amodiaquine (AQ) or sulfadoxine + pyrimethamine (SP). The proportion of resistant infections in vivo to these drugs was 44%, 16% and 7%, respectively. Gametocytes were counted by microscopy in thick smears on days 0, 4, 7 and 14 after treatment. There was a peak of gametocytaemia one week after treatment; on days 0, 7 and 14 the gametocyte prevalences were 35%, 73% and 63%, and the geometric means of gametocyte densities were 1.3, 12.5 and 5.6/microliter of blood. Three factors were found to influence gametocytaemia: treatment, efficacy of treatment, and duration of symptoms before treatment. Gametocyte prevalence and density significantly appeared higher in children treated with SP than with CQ, and higher with CQ than with AQ. Gametocyte prevalence and density were higher in resistant than in sensitive infections. The period between the appearance of the first clinical symptoms and treatment was positively and significantly linked to gametocyte prevalence and density on days 0 and 4. Early treatment with AQ, against sensitive infection, was followed by the lowest gametocytaemia. By contrast, treatment with SP against resistant infection was followed by the highest gametocytaemia. No clear relationship was observed between the density of asexual stages on day 0 and the gametocytaemia at any day between days 0 and 14. The epidemiological significance of post-therapeutic gametocytaemia and its possible role in the spread of resistant parasites are underlined. Solutions are proposed in order to avoid or reduce this gametocytaemia.
