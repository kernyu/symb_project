In search for a new antibacterial agent with improved antimicrobial spectrum and potency, we designed and synthesized a series of novel 3-((Z)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl) vinyl)-4H-chromen-4-ones 7a-h by convergent synthesis approach. All the synthesized compounds were assayed for their in-vitro antibacterial activities against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The preliminary structure-activity relationship, to elucidate the essential structure requirements for the antimicrobial activity that results into anti-MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) potential, has been described. Amongst the synthesized compounds 7d, 7e, 7f and 7h were found to possess activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus in addition to the activity against other bacterial strains such as E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, and E. coli.
