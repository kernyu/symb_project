1. Conventional cultivation and immunomagnetic separation (IMS) cultivation methods were compared for the isolation specificity and sensitivity of L. monocytogenes from turkey meat samples. PCR was used to confirm the isolates. Disc diffusion was performed to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profiles. A total of 180 turkey meat samples collected from markets in Turkey were tested. 2. L. monocytogenes was detected in 23 samples (12.7%) by IMS and conventional cultivation. It was isolated from 16.6% (10/60), 11.6% (7/60) and 10.0% (6/60) of the meat cut, breast and leg samples, respectively. PCR assay was performed based on hlyA (LLO-listeriolysin O) gene specific primers. In all 23 (100.0%) isolates of the hlyA gene were determined. The disc diffusion test showed that 19 (82.6%) isolates were resistant to penicillin G and 17 (73.9%) to ampicillin. In addition, 8 isolates were partially resistant to erythromycin and 8 to streptomycin. 3. In conclusion, to safeguard public health turkey meat must be produced under hygienic and suitable technological conditions. Furthermore antimicrobials, as prophylactic or growth promoter agents, must be firmly controlled by governmental agencies.
