Oxidants, generated by activated neutrophils, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of vascular disorders and lung injury; however, mechanisms of oxidant-mediated endothelial barrier dysfunction are unclear. Here, we have investigated the role of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in regulating hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of intercellular adhesion proteins and barrier function in endothelium. Treatment of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAECs) with H(2)O(2) increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, paxillin, beta-catenin, and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and decreased transendothelial electrical resistance (TER), an index of cell-cell adhesion and/or cell-matrix adhesion. To study the role of FAK in H(2)O(2)-induced TER changes, BPAECs were transfected with vector or FAK wild-type or FAK-related non-kinase (FRNK) plasmids. Overexpression of FRNK reduced FAK expression and attenuated H(2)O(2)-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, paxillin, beta-catenin, and VE-cadherin and cell-cell adhesion. Additionally, FRNK prevented H(2)O(2)-induced distribution of FAK, paxillin, beta-catenin, or VE-cadherin toward focal adhesions and cell-cell adhesions but not actin stress fiber formation. These results suggest that activation of FAK by H(2)O(2) is an important event in oxidant-mediated VE barrier function regulated by cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts.
