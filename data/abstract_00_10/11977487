Starting with the premise of preventing tuberculosis by watching the epidemiological succession (earliest discovery and medical attendance of new cases, interception of the transmitting ways by annihilating the hotbed and measures taken for the contacts, strengthening the specific resistance by the BCG vaccination and sanitary education) we have analyzed the application of these measures in adult cases, both bacteriologically confirmed (M+C+, M-C+) between 1995-2000 and found in those 280 contact children after the epidemiological investigation in Cluj-Napoca. The TSS/DOTS correctly and completely applied, no matter the place of application (hospital or ambulatory treatment) has drawn to a 75% rate of healings and debacillations in adults and to over 90% in children. Chronics and deaths have been registered in adults only through unconformity to treatment (failure + abandon + lost). The measures applied to the contacts were correct, finding out children with only the benign type of tuberculosis and, exceptionally only, (1%) with more severe forms, no deaths being registered in this period. The measures applicable to the home hotbed, the sanitary education as well as the protective measures of the sanitary medical staff, employed to supervise and control tuberculosis admits improvement still being far from the theoretic ideal.
