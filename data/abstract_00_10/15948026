PURPOSE: Recent research has identified gene expression of several types of xenobiotic transporters in the skin. The aim of this study was to investigate whether multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) functions in the skin. METHODS: The distribution of [14C]grepafloxacin in vivo and the transport of 1-[2-amino-5-(2,7-dichloro-6-hydroxy-3-oxo-9-xanthenyl)phenoxy]-2-(2-amino-5-meth ylphenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (fluo 3) were examined in the skin of Mrp1 knockout mice [FVB/Mrp1(-/-)] and normal mice [FVB/Mrp1(+/+)]. RESULTS: The tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio of [14C]grepafloxacin was higher in the skin of FVB/Mrp1(-/-) mice than that of FVB/Mrp1(+/+) mice. In skin slices of hairless mouse incubated with fluo 3 pentaacetoxymethyl ester, the accumulation of fluo 3 was significantly increased in the presence of probenecid (2 mM) and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (5 muM) in a time-dependent manner but did not change in the presence of tetraethylammonium (2 mM). In FVB/Mrp1(-/-) mouse skin, the accumulation of fluo 3 increased time-dependently, while no increase was observed in FVB/Mrp1(+/+) mouse skin. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Mrp1 is involved in the efflux of [14C]grepafloxacin and fluo 3 in the skin, possibly acting as part of a barrier system against xenobiotic compounds.
