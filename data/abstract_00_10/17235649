Outbreaks of multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi in the Indian subcontinent in the late 1980s resulted in the failure of conventional drugs, and ciprofloxacin became the firstline drug to treat enteric fever. However, reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, reported widely since 1994, has posed a therapeutic difficulty. The aim of the present work was to review the situation of drug resistance among S. enterica serotype Typhi in central India from 1988 to 2005. A minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) study for ciprofloxacin was carried out by the agar dilution method on 314 stock cultures preserved since 1988. The MIC for ciprofloxacin was < or = 0.125 mg/l for the 50 isolates isolated during 1989-1994, but during 1998-1999, 60% of the 50 isolates showed MIC > 0.125 mg/l, while in 2002-2003, 82.5 % of the 97 isolates had MIC > 0.125 mg/l and 35% had MIC > 1 mg/l (high-level resistance). In 2004-2005, 88.2% of the 77 isolates had MIC > 0.125 mg/l and 15% had MIC > 1 mg/l (high-level resistance). Sixty-four isolates showing MIC > 1 mg/l with the agar dilution method were also checked by Epsilometer test (E-test, AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). Based on the data, it is suggested to withdraw ciprofloxacin as a therapeutic agent for enteric fever. Fortunately, multiple drug resistance, with concurrent resistance to chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, and ampicillin, which had reached more than 90% in 1990-1991, started declining over the years and was as low as 5.6% in 2004-2005. According to these observations, older drugs such as chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, and ampicillin could be recalled to treat enteric fever.
