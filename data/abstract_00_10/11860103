Dry cow therapy, or antibiotic treatment at end of lactation, is used to eliminate intramammary infections and prevent new infections during the dry period. It is one part of a total management system recommended in controlling intramammary infections in the dairy cow. Public health concerns advise prudent use of antibiotics, as their use may promote bacterial antibiotic resistance and leave antibiotic residues in the food chain. The effects of dry cow treatment and no treatment were compared, on new intramammary infections and clinical mastitis within two low cell count herds and two herds undergoing conversion to organic farming. The results will inform those restricting their use of dry cow therapy on the additional risk of new intramammary infection and aid in development of alternative management strategies. No cases of clinical mastitis in the dry period were observed in treated cows, whereas in the untreated groups a significant number were observed. Significantly more new infections at calving were found in the untreated group in all herds. In those quarters where infections were first detected at calving, the incidence of clinical mastitis was significantly greater in the untreated group in all herds. Clinical mastitis detection was significantly lower in organic herds. Untreated quarters infected at drying with Corynebacterium spp. or coagulase-negative staphylococci were found to have an increased risk of new infection by Streptococcus uberis or coliform bacteria. It can be concluded that dry cow therapy continues to lower significantly the rate of new dry period intramammary infection in herds with elevated somatic cell counts and a high prevalence of infection.
