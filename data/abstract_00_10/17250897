OBJECTIVE: To measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative pathogens collected from the nine census regions of the USA. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 76 centers between January 2004 and September 2005. In vitro activity was assessed using CLSI guidelines and CLSI or FDA interpretive criteria. RESULTS: The lowest overall antimicrobial susceptibilities for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex isolates (n=851) were detected in the Middle Atlantic and East South Central regions. Overall, 29.3% of A. calcoaceticus-baumannii complex isolates were multidrug-resistant (resistant to > or =3 antimicrobial classes). Tigecycline (2 microg/mL) had the lowest MIC90 against this organism. Imipenem, tigecycline, and levofloxacin had low MIC90s (0.25-4 microg/mL) against Enterobacter spp. (n=1557), although the MIC90 for levofloxacin was elevated for East South Central region isolates (> or = 16 microg/mL). Susceptibility to levofloxacin among the E. coli isolates (n=1785) ranged from 71.7% (Pacific) to 88.5% (New England). The prevalence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (126/1460) varied from 1.7% of isolates (Pacific) to 21.2% (Middle Atlantic). ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae MICs were lowest for imipenem and tigecycline. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial susceptibility varies among the census regions of the USA. The broad-spectrum in vitro activity of tigecycline may make it a suitable candidate for use in the empiric treatment of serious infections.
