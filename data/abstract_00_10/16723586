Among 16 human immunodeficiency virus-infected (subtype C) Batswana patients who failed nelfinavir (NFV)-containing regimens, the most prevalent mutation observed was D30N (54%), followed by L90M (31%). L89I, K20T/I, and E35D polymorphic changes were also identified. These findings suggest that subtype C viruses in Botswana may develop resistance to NFV via subtype-specific pathways.
