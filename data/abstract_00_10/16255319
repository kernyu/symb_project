Treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) has changed in the past few years with researchers advocating empiric treatment for shorter periods of time without the use of cultures. Researchers report that antibiotic resistance of Escherichia coli (E. coli) to commonly prescribed antibiotics in uncomplicated UTIs has been increasing. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is 1 of these antibiotics. Researchers also report that resistance patterns may differ depending on the geographic area of the United States. In this study, the authors present the results of a 7-month retrospective chart analysis of 98 E. coli sensitivities to commonly prescribed antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs at a college health service. They examined the more common antibiotic choices and analyzed their in vitro responses. Of these antibiotics, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and TMP/SMX had the highest sensitivity rates. The authors compared the results with a previous study that they performed at the same institution in 1993. The results of this study show a sensitivity rate of 86% for TMP/SMX. When compared with the previous result of 87%, this represented a 1% change. Because of this slight decrease in sensitivity and the increasing concern over resistance, the authors suggest that they will continue to reevaluate the resistance pattern in their population on a regular basis. This will help determine if there is a need for modifying choices of empiric therapy for UTIs.
