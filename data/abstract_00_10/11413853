UNLABELLED: HYPERLIPIDEMIA: HIV-1 protease-inhibitors therapy is associated with increased levels of triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and Lp(a). But the understanding of hyperlipidaemia occurring in patients treated with HIV-1 protease-inhibitors is not easy since HIV infection itself is associated with lipid abnormalities and since HIV-1 protease-inhibitors therapy is also responsible for the development of a lipodystrophy syndrome (insulin resistance) which may influence lipid metabolism. However, many data indicate that HIV-1 protease-inhibitors therapy itself modifies significantly lipid metabolism. UNDERLYING MECHANISMS: The mechanisms involved in HIV-1 protease-inhibitors induced hyperlipidaemia are still unclear. HIV-1 protease-inhibitors could bind to LRP (Low density lipoprotein receptor Related Protein), impairing hepatic chylomicron-remnants and VLDL uptake. They could interact with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), which functions as a heterodimer with PPAR (Peroxisome Proliferator Activator Receptor). HIV-1 protease-inhibitors could also modify lipoprotein metabolism through cytokines.
