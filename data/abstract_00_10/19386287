OBJECTIVES: To report the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM). METHODS: We performed an open study in PM and DM with active disease. Indications for treatment were: steroid-dependency, refractoriness to steroid and/or immunosuppressants, and life-threatening disease. IVIg was used at 2 g/kg in monthly cycles for six months and then each other month for other three cycles. MMF was slowly titrated to 30 mg/kg/day orally. Parameters employed to follow patients were the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, the modified Rankin score, CK serum levels and daily prednisone dose. RESULTS: Seven patients were studied (4PM, 3DM). All were females, with a mean age of 49 years. All of them achieved a complete remission and, at the last follow-up visit, significant differences in MRC score, modified Rankin score, CK levels, and the daily maintenance prednisone dose were documented. No relevant side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: IVIg as add on treatment with MMF is effective in severe and refractory myositis, moreover as safe and steroid-sparing agent.
