A previous study at our institution revealed 98% of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates were susceptible to clindamycin; however, beta-lactams were then the predominant empiric treatment. This follow-up chart review study examined subsequent staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infection treatment and susceptibility patterns over a 2-year period. Of 296 S. aureus skin and soft tissue infections, 73% were MRSA, of which 87% were community-associated-MRSA; MRSA infections peaked in warm summer months. Despite a significant increase in empiric clindamycin use, 97% of community-associated-MRSA isolates retained susceptibility to clindamycin.
