Aqueous Brussels sprouts extracts inhibit oxidation of isolated DNA in vitro, possibly through scavenging oxygen radicals. We have studied the effect of preincubating human lymphocytes with aqueous extracts of raw, cooked and autolysed Brussels sprouts and the glucosinolate, sinigrin, on hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage, strand breaks and base oxidation, in vitro by means of the Comet assay. DNA repair enzymes endonuclease III (EndoIII) and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (FPG) were used to examine the levels of oxidised pyrimidines and purines in DNA, respectively. Aqueous extracts of cooked and autolysed Brussels sprouts and sinigrin decreased DNA strand breaks in human lymphocytes exposed to 100 microM H2O2 for 5 min on ice, although the level of EndoIII and FPG sensitive sites was not reduced. The maximum inhibition was by 38 and 39% at concentrations of cooked and autolysed extracts of 10 microg/ml and 5 microg/ml, respectively, whereas the inhibitory effect decreased with increasing concentrations up to 100 microg/ml. The maximum inhibition by sinigrin was by 54% at 2 microg/ml. Extracts of raw Brussels sprouts or green beans had no DNA-protective effect. The results indicate that compounds, including sinigrin, in cooked and autolysed Brussels sprouts can enhance lymphocyte resistance towards H2O2-induced DNA strand breaks in vitro.
