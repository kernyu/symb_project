AIM: To detect the integron-positive strains among nosocomial Acinetobacter spp. and to determine their relationship on the genotype level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Amplification by polymerase chain reaction using primers specific to sequences of the class 1 and 2 intergrons on the genomic DNA template followed by restriction fragments length polymorphism analysis as well as RAPD-genotyping of the integron-positive strains were performed. RESULTS: Fact of spreading of Acinetobacter baumanii strain containing class 1 integron in medical centers was established. The composition of the integron's gene cassettes was analogous to worldwide (including epidemic) types. CONCLUSION: Molecular genetic analysis of the mobilized structures (integrons) under the standardization of used approaches are suitable for the surveillance for circulation of epidemic strains of nosocomial pathogens.
