This study was conducted in an effort to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and antibiotic-resistant gene regulation from Saliva miltiorrhiza Bunge on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A variety of solvent fractions and methanol extracts of S. miltiorrhiza Bunge were tested in order to determine its antimicrobial activities against S. aureus and MRSA. As a result, the hexane fraction of S. miltiorrhiza Bunge evidenced the highest levels of antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and MRSA. The MICs of the hexane fraction against various MRSA specimens were 64<MICs<or=128 microg/ml. The hexane fraction evidenced inhibitory effects superior to those of the chloroform fraction. The results showed inhibition zones of hexane (16 mm) and chloroform (14 mm) fractions against MRSA KCCM 40511 at 1,000 microg/disc. The hexane and chloroform fractions inhibited the expression of the resistant genes, mecA, mecR1, and femA in mRNA. Moreover, the results of Western blotting assays indicated that the hexane and chloroform fractions inhibited the expression of the resistant protein, PBP2a. These results reveal that the hexane and chloroform fractions of S. miltiorrhiza Bunge may prove to be a valuable choice for studies targeted toward the development of new antimicrobial agents.
