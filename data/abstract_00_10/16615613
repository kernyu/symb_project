During the cholera epidemic that occurred in Dakar, Senegal in 2004, we treated a total of 593 confirmed or suspected cases in our department. The purpose of this report is to describe epidemiologic, clinical, bacteriologic and therapeutic aspects of these cases. Study was conducted at the infectious diseases clinic from October 11 to December 20, 2004. Mean patient age was 30 years and the sex ratio was 133. The likely source of contamination was food or water intake in 92% of cases. The duration of the epidemic was short (75 days). Onset was sudden in 98% of cases and the main clinical manifestations were watery diarrhoea (95%) and vomiting (78%). The mean delay between symptoms and hospitalization was 11 hours and the number of stools before admission to the hospital was greater than 10 in 23% of cases. At the time of admission 119 patients (20.1%) were severely dehydrated. A total of 250 coprocultures were performed. Results were positive in 145 cases (58%) including 112 (44%) for Vibrio cholerae 01. Antibiotic testing carried out on 36 strains demonstrated excellent sensitivity to doxycycine and pefloxacine but resistance to cotrimoxazole, amoxicilline and chloramphenicol. Oral rehydration therapy was used in most cases (61%). The mortality rate was 0.5%. Cholera is a medical emergency that can have a favourable prognosis with properly organized management.
