It has been suggested Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib) disease is uncommon in Asia. During 1993--1997, we conducted prospective surveillance of acute infections caused by H. influenzae in 6 academic referral Indian hospitals. The study included 5798 patients aged 1 month to 50 years who had diseases likely to be caused by H. influenzae; 75% of the patients were aged <5 years. A total of 125 H. influenzae infections were detected, 97% of which were caused by Hib. Of 125 isolates, 108 (86%) were from children aged <5 years, and 11 (9%) were from adults aged >18 years. Sixty-two percent of the patients had meningitis. The case-fatality rate was 11% overall and 20% in infants with Hib meningitis. Up to 60% of all isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or erythromycin; 32% were resistant to >/= 3 antimicrobial drugs, but none were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. These data suggest that available Hib vaccines will benefit Indian children.
