A phase II study of troxacitabine, a non-natural dioxolane nucleoside L-enantiomer, was conducted in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP). Patients were untreated for BP, or treated with imatinib mesylate (IM) as sole prior therapy for BP. Troxacitabine was given as an intravenous infusion over 30 min daily for 5 days at a dose of 8.0 mg/m(2) per day. Thirty-one patients, 29 (93%) of whom had failed prior IM therapy, received 51 courses of therapy. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities included stomatitis (4%), hand-foot syndrome (18%), and skin rash (12%). Four patients (13%) responded. Troxacitabine-based combinations merit study in IM-resistant CML.
