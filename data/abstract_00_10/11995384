EPIDEMIOLOGY: The increasing importance of Acinetobacter as a nosocomial pathogen responsible for outbreaks in intensive care units has been pointed out for twenty years. Today Acinetobacter infections are essentially pneumonia in patients under mechanical ventilation. EXPERIMENTAL MODELS: Most clinical isolates are resistant to b-lactam antibiotics as well as to other drugs. Animal models represent an essential step between in vivo testing an<d clinical studies, necessary to understand physiopathology, pharmacology and efficacy of therapy. The virulence of clinical isolates of Acinetobacter spp has been studied in a mouse model of systemic infection. Pharmacological studies and efficacy of antibiotics have been studied in a mouse model of Acinetobacter pneumonia. HUMAN THERAPEUTICS: The majority of strains are multi-resistant to antibiotics and the infections they cause are difficult to treat. Isolated or combined Sulbactam has often been used with success.
