Guidelines for Management of HAP were developed jointly by the ATS and IDSA in 2004. These guidelines were designed to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the emergence of MDR pathogens (see Fig. 1).Principles include early initiation of appropriate and adequate antibiotic therapy after cultures of blood and sputum are obtained. Quantitative distal airway sampling by bronchoscopy provides greater diagnostic specificity for VAP: in one randomized study, improved outcomes were noted, compared with clinical diagnosis with qualitative endotracheal aspirates. Higher doses of initial, empiric antibiotics also are recommended. Assessment of the patient's clinical response to empiric antibiotics should be correlated with microbiologic results to streamline, de-escalate, or stop unnecessary anti-biotic treatment. Duration of therapy for uncomplicated HAP should be limited to 7 days followed by close monitoring for relapse after cessation of antibiotics. The authors suggest that prevention strategies target modifiable short- and long-term risk factors. They also advocate the use of a multidisciplinary team that is dedicated to the treatment and prevention of HCAP and the basic principle of the modern Hippocratic Oath: "I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure."
