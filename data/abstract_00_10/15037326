Nosocomially acquired urinary tract infection (NAUTI) is the most frequent nosocomial infection and a particular problem in urology departments. The incidence of NAUTI has become an important quality parameter and a legal issue. Several characteristics related to the health care provider, the patient and the procedures are known to increase the risk of NAUTI. The single most important risk factor for NAUTI is an indwelling catheter. NAUTI may be prevented by good health care facilities, evidence-based practice, wise patient selection and surgical skill. But the most important factors are tailored antibiotic prophylaxis and continuous monitoring of the incidence and pathogens causing NAUTI in each institution. Raising antimicrobial resistance in some countries calls for a closer monitoring of NAUTI on international level within urology. There is room for improvement in urinary catheter care in many hospitals, and the importance of patient and urological risk factors for development of NAUTI is not fully known. In order to meet these challenges the European Society for Infections in Urology is planning a prevalence study combined with a quality improvement initiative related to NAUTI.
