Optimal therapy for serious Streptococcal pneumoniae infections with intermediate or high-grade resistance to penicillin is controversial. It should be noted that data regarding the efficacy of penicillins or cephalosporins for penicillin-resistant strains are limited. Despite the paucity of clinical trials, most clinicians still agree that penicillins remain the mainstay of therapy for community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcal pneumoniae-susceptible strains. Macrolide antibiotics are effective for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. But resistance to all macrolides, based on current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards breakpoints, should be assumed among isolates with erythromycin resistance. The late-generation fluoroquinolones have a role for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, however, there is also the potential for evolution of antimicrobial resistance. Performance indicators for community-acquired pneumonia are being established with implementation of protocols for inpatients with pneumonia. These indicators are being monitored by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for medicare patients as part of a national project. The indicators also address documentation of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine status in patients. Several other indicators, such as obtaining blood cultures before antibiotic administration, using antibiotics according to current guidelines, and timely administration of antibiotics, will play critical roles in the management of community-acquired pneumonia. Because of increased incremental costs associated with community-acquired pneumonia, early diagnosis and timely intravenous to oral switch therapy will continue to be emphasized and monitored in those admitted into hospitals, together with the appropriate decision tree-based pneumonia specific severity of illness scoring system.
