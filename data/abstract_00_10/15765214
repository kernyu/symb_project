To understand the development of bacterial resistance and multi-resistance following treatment with topical and systemic antibiotics is important for dermatologists. Furthermore the sensitization potential and toxicity of antibiotics applied to large skin areas must be considered. The advantage of many topical antibiotics is evident; extremely high concentrations can be achieved in the infected skin usually without any systemic side effects. When an antibiotic is used both systemically and topically, indications should be weighed carefully for topical use, in order to reduce the likelihood of sensitization to an potential systemic agent. Continuous monitoring of the resistance profile of important bacteria is also desirable, in order to preserve the utility of important "reserve antibiotics". In this review the most important topical antibiotics used in Germany are evaluated with regards to efficacy and safety profile.
