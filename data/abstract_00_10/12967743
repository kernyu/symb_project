Microbiology laboratory personnel from 77 rural hospitals in Idaho, Nevada, Utah, and eastern Washington were surveyed in July 2000 regarding their routine practices for detecting antimicrobial resistance. Their self-reported responses were compared to recommended laboratory practices. Most hospitals reported performing onsite bacterial identification and susceptibility testing. Many reported detecting targeted antimicrobial resistant organisms. While only 5/61 hospitals (8%) described using screening tests capable of detecting all 8 targeted types of resistance, most (57/61, 93%) were capable of accurately screening for at least 6 types. Conversely, most hospitals (58/61, 95%) reported confirmatory testing capable of identifying only 3 or fewer resistance types with high-level penicillin resistance among pneumococci, methicillin and vancomycin resistance among staphylococci and enterococci, and extended spectrum beta-lactamase production by Gram-negative bacilli presenting the greatest difficulties. Furthermore, only 50% of hospitals compiled annual antibiogram reports to help physicians choose initial therapy for suspected infectious illnesses. This survey suggests that the antimicrobial susceptibility testing in many rural hospitals may be unreliable.
