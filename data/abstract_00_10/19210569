In a time when conventional antibiotics are becoming increasingly less effective for treatment of infections, the relationship between bacteria and antimicrobial resistance is becoming more and more complicated. This paper provides a current review of studies reported in the literature pertaining to the antibiotherapy of human urinary tract infections (UTI), in a way that helps the reader direct a bibliographic search and develop an integrated perspective of the subject. Highlights are given to (bio)pathogenesis of uncomplicated cystitis. Features associated with the antibiotherapy of UTI such as development of resistance are presented in the text systematically. This review discusses recent advances in the understanding of how the predominant uropathogen Escherichia coli interacts with its host and leads to infection; so one can understand some of the reasons behind antibiotherapy failures.
