Enfuvirtide has been a cornerstone of salvage therapy for multidrug-resistant HIV. Raltegravir provides another novel class option, with the advantages of easier administration and improved tolerability. Thirty-five adults electively replaced enfuvirtide with raltegravir while the rest of their regimen was unchanged. All maintained virologic suppression after a median of 7 months except one who experienced a transiently detectable viral load after 5 months. The new regimen was well tolerated with no apparent new drug-related adverse clinical or laboratory events.
