The incidence of beta-lactamase production in anaerobic gram-negative rods isolated from 93 pus specimens of orofacial odontogenic infections and the antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates against 11 antibiotics were determined. A total of 191 anaerobic gram-negative rods were isolated from the specimens. Beta-lactamase was detected in 35.6% of the black-pigmented Prevotella and 31.9% of the nonpigmented Prevotella. However, no strains among the other species isolated produced beta-lactamase. Ampicillin, cefazolin and cefotaxime showed decreased activity as regards beta-lactamase-positive Prevotella strains, whereas the activity of ampicillin/sulbactam, cefmetazole, and imipenem continued to be effective against such strains. All tested beta-lactam antibiotics were effective against Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium. Erythromycin showed decreased activity against nonpigmented Prevotella and Fusobacterium. Clindamycin, minocycline and metronidazole were powerful antibiotics against which anaerobic gram-negative rods could be tested. The present study showed that beta-lactamase-positive strains were found more frequently in the Prevotella strains than in any of the other species of anaerobic gram-negative rods. The effectiveness of adding sulbactam to ampicillin was demonstrated, as well as the difference in cephalosporin activity against beta-lactamase-positive strains.
