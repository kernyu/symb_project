The lmrB gene of Corynebacterium glutamicum, which confers specific resistance to lincosamides, such as lincomycin and clindamycin, was isolated. C. glutamicum cells, carrying the lmrB gene in a multicopy plasmid, showed increased resistance to lincomycin with a MIC of 230 microg/ml, which is a 9-fold increase compared to that of the wild type. The lmrB-disrupted mutant became sensitive to the compound. No difference in sensitivity to erythromycin, penicillin G, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, spectinomycin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, streptomycin, ethidium bromide, and sodium dodecyl sulfate was observed. The protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone abolished the lincomycin-resistance of lmrB-carrying cells. The putative protein product of the gene contained 14-transmembrane regions and showed high amino acid-sequence homology to the drug efflux pumps of other organisms. In addition, the putative protein contained a motif for major facilitators, suggesting a role in efflux-mediated resistance to lincomycin.
