Antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is increasing in the Pacific region. The standard antibiotic used in urban Australia is intramuscular ceftriaxone. Isolates with reduced sensitivity are being isolated; however, resistance to ceftriaxone has yet to occur. Continued surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in the pathogen, with communication between clinic and laboratory, is needed to ensure optimal treatment of infection.
