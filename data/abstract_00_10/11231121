Hepatobiliary transport of endogenous and exogenous compounds is mediated by the coordinated action of multiple transport systems present at the sinusoidal (basolateral) and canalicular (apical) membrane domains of hepatocytes. During the last few years many of these transporters have been cloned and functionally characterized. In addition, the molecular bases of several forms of cholestatic liver disease have been defined. Combined, this has greatly expanded our understanding of the normal physiology of bile formation, the pathophysiology of intrahepatic cholestasis, as well as of drug elimination and disposition processes. In this review recent advances, with respect to function and regulation of ATP binding cassette transport proteins expressed in liver, are summarized and discussed.
