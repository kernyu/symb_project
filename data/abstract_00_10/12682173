We report on the first isolation of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Leclercia adecarboxylata strain from the bloodstream in a 58-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia. The strain, resistant to ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and aztreonam, produces the SHV-12 beta-lactamase, one of the most common variants found in Italian nosocomial isolates of Enterobacteriaceae.
