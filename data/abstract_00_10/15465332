3-Alkyl/arylalkyl substituted 2-butenols 9, 10, 23a-d undergo regiospecific photooxygenation to furnish beta-hydroxyhydroperoxides 11, 12, 24a-d, respectively, in reasonable yields. Acid catalyzed condensation of 11, 12, 24a-d with various ketones furnish new 1,2,4-trioxanes 13-18, 25a-d, 26a-d, 27a-d in good yields. Several of these trioxanes show promising antimalarial activity against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium yoelii in mice by oral and intramuscular routes.
