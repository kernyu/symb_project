OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of bacteria responsible for community-acquired meningitis and the pattern of resistance of common species. DESIGN: All bacteriologically confirmed cases of community-acquired meningitis were recorded between 1993 and 2001. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-four cases of bacterial meningitis were recorded. The most frequent species were Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae followed by Neisseria meningitidis with respectively 37.1%, 32.1%, and 10.7% of cases. The yearly distribution of these bacteria did not show any epidemic peak. Enterobacteria and group B Streptococcus were the most frequently identified pathogens in neonatal meningitis. H. influenzae was the predominant microorganism in children between one month and five years of age, (66.4%) followed by S. pneumoniae (23.5%). S. pneumoniae was the predominant bacteria responsible fore more than half of the cases over five years of age. 28.8% of H. influenzae strains produced beta-lactamase. 27.2% of S. pneumoniae strains were less susceptible to penicillin. Resistance rates for amoxicillin and cefotaxime were respectively 10.6% and 7.5%. Only one strain of N. meningitidis (4.2%) presented with a decreased susceptibility to penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were the main microorganisms responsible for community-acquired meningitis. High resistance rates were found for these bacteria: 28.8% of H. influenzae to ampicillin and 27.2% of S. pneumoniae to penicillin.
