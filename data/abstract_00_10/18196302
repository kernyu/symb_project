The non-tuberculous mycobacterium Mycobacterium immunogenum colonizes industrial metalworking fluids (MWFs) presumably due to its relative resistance to the currently practiced biocides and has been implicated in occupational respiratory hazards, particularly hypersensitivity pneumonitis. With an aim to understand its inherent biocide susceptibility profile and survival potential in MWF, five different genotypes of this organism, including a reference genotype (700506) and four novel test genotypes (MJY-3, MJY-4, MJY-10 and MJY-12) isolated in our recent study from diverse MWF operations were evaluated. For this, two commercial biocide formulations, Grotan (Hexahydro-1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)-s-triazine) and Kathon (5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one) currently practiced for the control of microorganisms, including mycobacteria, in MWF operations were tested. Effect of the fluid matrix on the biocide susceptibility was investigated for the synthetic (S) and semi-synthetic (SS) MWF matrices. In general, the minimum inhibitory concentration values were higher for the HCHO-releasing biocide Grotan than the isothiazolone biocide Kathon. All genotypes (except the reference genotype) showed lower susceptibility in SS as compared to S fluid matrix for Grotan. However, in case of Kathon, a greater susceptibility was observed in SS fluid for majority of the test genotypes (MJY-3, 4 and 10). The test genotypes were more resistant than the reference genotype to either biocide in both fluid types. Furthermore, the individual genotypes showed differential biocidal susceptibility, with MJY-10 being the most resistant. These observations emphasize the importance of using the resistant genotypes of M. immunogenum as the test strains for formulation or development and evaluation of existing and novel biocides, for industrial applications.
