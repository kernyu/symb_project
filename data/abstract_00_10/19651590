The therapeutic approach to childhood nephrotic syndrome is based on a series of studies that began with an international collaborative effort sponsored by the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children in 1967. The characteristics of children presenting with nephrotic syndrome have changed over recent decades with greater frequency of the challenging condition focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and a greater prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus, which may be resistant to glucocorticoids in the former and exacerbated by long-term glucocorticoid therapy in the latter 2 conditions. The Children's Nephrotic Syndrome Consensus Conference was formed to systematically review the published literature and generate a children's primary nephrotic syndrome guideline for use in educational, therapeutic, and research venues.
