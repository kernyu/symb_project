OBJECTIVES: The multiresistance plasmid pSCFS1 from Staphylococcus sciuri was sequenced completely and analysed with regard to its gene organization and the putative role of a novel ABC transporter in antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: Plasmid pSCFS1 was transformed into Staphylococcus aureus RN4220, overlapping restriction fragments were cloned into Escherichia coli plasmid vectors and sequenced. For further analysis of the ABC transporter, a approximately 3 kb EcoRV-HpaI fragment was cloned into the staphylococcal plasmid pT181MCS and the respective S. aureus RN4220 transformants were subjected to MIC determination. RESULTS: A total of 14 ORFs coding for proteins of >100 amino acids were detected within the 17 108 bp sequence of pSCFS1. Five of them showed similarity to recombination/mobilization genes while another two were similar to plasmid replication genes. In addition to the previously described genes cfr for chloramphenicol/florfenicol resistance and erm(33) for inducible resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance, a Tn554-like spectinomycin resistance gene and Tn554-related transposase genes were identified. Moreover, a novel ABC transporter was detected and shown to mediate low-level lincosamide resistance. CONCLUSION: Plasmid pSCFS1 is composed of various parts which show similarity to sequences known to occur on plasmids or transposons of Gram-positive, but also Gram-negative bacteria. It is likely that pSCFS1 represents the result of inter-plasmid recombination events also involving the truncation of a Tn554-like transposon.
