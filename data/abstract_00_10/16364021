During a study on Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Derby from slaughter-age pigs in Brazil, two epidemiologically unrelated multi-resistant S. Derby isolates were found to carry a class 1 integron with a single gene cassette. Sequence analysis confirmed that this gene cassette harboured an aadA2 gene. The aadA2 gene codes for an aminoglycoside adenyltransferase, which mediates resistance to the aminoglycoside streptomycin and the aminocyclitol spectinomycin. Although aadA2 gene cassettes are widely distributed among Salmonella, database searches identified an AadA2 protein indistinguishable from that of S. Derby only in single isolates of S. enterica subsp. enterica Enteritidis from France and S. enterica subsp. enterica Typhimurium from Japan. Structural analysis of the 59-base element revealed at least one base pair difference between the 59-base element of the aadA2 cassette from S. Derby and any of the 59-base elements deposited in the databases.
