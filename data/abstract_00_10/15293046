Since 1999, two Cooperia oncophora isolates, originally obtained from the United Kingdom, have been maintained by regular passage through calves at the Macdonald Campus, McGill University farm. One isolate, IVS, was originally susceptible to ivermectin, while the IVR isolate was originally resistant to ivermectin. These two isolates have been used to study the mechanisms of ivermectin resistance. To confirm the susceptible/resistant status after 4 years of passaging through calves, a controlled study was performed in which two worm-free calves were experimentally infected with IVS and another two worm-free calves with the IVR infective larvae. The calves were treated with ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg) subcutaneously (Ivomec Injection) 21 days after infection. Ivermectin at the recommended dose was 100% effective at eliminating the IVS isolate, since no eggs were found in feces, and no adult worms were found in the small intestine of the treated IVS-infected calf. In contrast, the IVR-infected calf continued to pass eggs in feces even after treatment with ivermectin, and adult worms (250) were found in the small intestine at necropsy. The untreated calves had 1,330 and 848 adult worms, respectively, for the IVS and IVR infected animals.
