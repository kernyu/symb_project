The activities of 10 combinations of antifungal agents against 25 clinical isolates of Scopulariopsis brevicaulis were tested by the checkerboard technique. An average indifferent effect was detected for all combinations. Synergy was observed for some isolates and combinations, particularly with posaconazole-terbinafine (68% of strains), amphotericin B-caspofungin (60%), and posaconazole-caspofungin (48%).
