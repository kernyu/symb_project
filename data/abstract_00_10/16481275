BACKGROUND: Patients with decompensated hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis tend to have low or undetectable HBV replication. However, some patients continue to have high levels of HBV replication and effective suppression of HBV replication with antiviral agents may potentially decrease hepatic necroinflammation and improve or stabilize liver function. This review was to understand the efficacy and safety of lamivudine in the treatment of decompensated HBV cirrhosis. DATA SOURCES: An English-language literature search (MEDLINE January 1988-July 2005) was performed, and a total of 52 articles/abstracts relevant to the issue were selected. After review of the selected papers, the meaningful results and conclusions were extracted using scientific criteria. The papers reviewed pertained mainly to the efficacy and safety profiles of lamivudine treatment for decompensated HBV cirrhosis. RESULTS: The ultimate treatment of decompensated HBV cirrhosis is liver transplantation, but lamivudine treatment may lead to rapid suppression of viral replication and improvement of biochemical and clinical parameters, reduced morbidity and hospitalization for complications of liver disease, increased pre-transplant survival as well as reduced need for transplantation. However, viral resistance can develop after prolonged treatment with lamivudine, and breakthrough hepatitis may be fatal in few patients. Adefovir is effective for lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral therapy with lamivudine for decompensated HBV cirrhosis can be effective. However, some patients may experience a hepatitis flare with the emergence of YMDD mutants resulting in progressive worsening of liver disease, and should be referred for "rescue" therapy with other nucleoside/nucleotide analogues such as adefovir dipivoxil.
