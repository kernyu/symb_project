During the past decade there have been major changes in the susceptibility of bacteria that cause various infections. Resistance to anti-infective agents, including antibiotics, is worldwide, both in developed and developing countries. Almost all bacterial species can develop resistance to anti-infective agents and resistance can readily be transferred among bacteria by transmissible elements (plasmids). Measures to prevent the emergence of resistance must be implemented urgently. A multiplicity of factors drive antibiotic resistance and solutions require the collaboration of governmental agencies, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers and consumers. Knowledge of resistance patterns and of the ways by which resistance is overcome is vital to the future of antimicrobial chemotherapy.
