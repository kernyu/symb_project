OBJECTIVE: Central venous catheters (CVC) are a major cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Catheters modified with miconazole and rifampicin that constantly and slowly release antimicrobial substances are assumed to be beneficial in reducing rates of colonization and catheter-related infections. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective controlled non-blinded randomized clinical trial in two German university hospitals. PATIENTS: 223 adult inpatients with CVC between October 2000 and February 2002. Baseline characteristics, APACHE II score and therapeutic interventions were comparable. INTERVENTION: Randomization to receive either a miconazole and rifampicin modified catheter (n=118) or a standard triple-lumen CVC (n=105). MEASUREMENTS, DEFINITIONS: Microbiological evaluation was done after CVC removal. A catheter was considered colonized if growth of > or =15 cfu was found by semi-quantitative roll-plate technique from a proximal or distal catheter segment. A catheter-related infection (CRI) was defined as a colonized catheter with local signs of inflammation. A catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) was defined as a colonized catheter with isolation of the same organism from the patient's blood with accompanying clinical signs of infection. RESULTS: A colonization of CVC was observed in six patients (5.1%) with a modified catheter and 38 patients (36.2%) with a standard catheter (P < 0.001). Five patients in the modified group (4.2%) and 18 in the standard group (17.1%) developed CRI (P=0.002). One assumed CR-BSI was detected in the standard group, with none in the modified group. No adverse effects related to the modified catheters and no antimicrobial resistance were observed. CONCLUSION: CVC supersaturated with miconazole and rifampicin were associated with a significantly lower risk for catheter colonization and catheter-related infections compared to standard catheters.
