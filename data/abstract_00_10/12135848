During the period 1994-2000 all uropathogens cultured from urine of hospitalized urological patients were identified and susceptibility was tested against 11 antibacterials. Duplicated isolates were eliminated. There was no general trend of increased of resistance apart from E. coli to ciprofloxacin (10.4% in 2000). Vancomycin-resistant staphylococci or enterococci was not significant. The lowest overall rates of resistance were found with piperacillin/tazobactam followed by ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. Ciprofloxacin was the best oral antibiotic for the empirical treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) due to Gram-negative rods and ampicillin/sulbactam for the treatment of UTI with Gram-positive cocci.
