INTRODUCTION: We present gentamicin-vancomycin-impregnated beads that can be produced intraoperatively in moulds and demonstrated their successful use in ten cases of problematic Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. METHODS: To produce the antibiotically loaded PMMA beads, a two-part mould of polyoxymethylene was used. The mixture of PMMA and antibiotic is poured into the mould halves, and during polymerisation the halves bond together. The in vivo antibiotic concentrations of wound secretion from the redon drainage were measured by fluorescence-polarisation immunoassay, and a concentration/time function was determined. The PMMA beads (2 g of vancomycin plus 0.5 g of gentamicin plus 40 g of PMMA) were implanted in ten patients aged 41-76 years. RESULTS: In all ten patients, the infection was cured (follow-up 15 months). CONCLUSION: The combination of gentamicin and vancomycin in the PMMA of standardised beads represents a good alternative in the treatment of MRSA infections. Understanding of the mechanism of antibiotic release from PMMA allows differentiated dosing during systemic application.
