A study was carried out to determine the incidence of Cryptococcus species in AIDS patients and their susceptibility pattern to the different antifungal drugs used for therapy. PCR as a rapid diagnostic tool for cryptococcal meningitis was evaluated. All the isolates were senstive to the three antifungal drugs tested indicating that the development of drug resistance is not a major problem in the treatment of cryptococcosis. All the culture positive specimens were positive by PCR which can be evolved into a very useful, rapid diagnostic tool to detect cryptococci in clinical specimens.
