The inactivation of ampD in Pseudomonas aeruginosa leads to a partially derepressed phenotype, characterized by a moderately high level basal ampC expression that is still further inducible, due to the presence of two additional ampD genes in this species (ampDh2 and ampDh3). The sequential inactivation of the three ampD genes was shown to lead to a stepwise upregulation of ampC expression, reaching full derepression in the triple mutant. To gain insight into the biological role of P. aeruginosa AmpD multiplicity, we determined the effects of the inactivation of the ampD genes on fitness and virulence. We show that, in contrast to what was previously documented for Salmonella spp., the inactivation of ampD in P. aeruginosa does not affect fitness or virulence in a mouse model of systemic infection. This lack of effect was demonstrated to be dependent on the presence of the additional ampD genes (ampDh2 and ampDh3), since the double and the triple ampD mutants completely lost their biological competitiveness and virulence; full ampC derepression and disruption of the AmpD peptidoglycan recycling system itself are both found to cause a major biological cost. Furthermore, among the ampD genes, ampDh3 is found to be the most relevant for virulence in P. aeruginosa. Therefore, as a consequence of the presence of additional ampD genes, partial ampC derepression mediated by ampD inactivation confers a biologically efficient resistance mechanism on P. aeruginosa.
