A tularaemia focus was detected in 1998 in Bulgaria, in an area where tularaemia had never been reported. The properties of Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica strains isolated from 1998 to 2005 were studied. The strains showed heterogeneity, based on acid production from glycerol and erythromycin susceptibility. Genotyping by analysis of seven loci containing variable-number tandem repeats showed four genotypes among eight strains.
