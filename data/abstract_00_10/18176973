AIM: To compare the ligase detection reaction (LDR) and real-time PCR for detection of low abundant YMDD mutants in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. METHODS: Mixtures of plasmids and serum samples from 52 chronic hepatitis B patients with low abundant lamivudine-resistant mutations were tested with LDR and real-time PCR. Time required and reagent cost for both assays were evaluated. RESULTS: Real-time PCR detected 100, 50, 10, 1 and 0.1% of YIDD plasmid, whereas LDR detected 100, 50, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01% of YIDD plasmid, in mixtures with YMDD plasmid of 10(6) copies/mL. Among the 52 clinical serum samples, completely concordant results were obtained for all samples by both assays, and 39 YIDD, 9 YVDD, and 4 YIDD/YVDD were detected. Cost and time required for LDR and real-time PCR are 60/80 CNY (8/10.7 US dollars) and 4.5/2.5 h, respectively. CONCLUSION: LDR and real-time PCR are both sensitive and inexpensive methods for monitoring low abundant YMDD mutants during lamivudine therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B. LDR is more sensitive and less expensive, while real-time PCR is more rapid.
