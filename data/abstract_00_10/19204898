The probiotic relevant characteristics of 45 strains of vaginal Lactobacillus isolated from healthy women were analyzed. Of these, 21 strains were classified as L. crispatus, 17 as L. jensenii, six as L. gasseri, and one as L. plantarum. The rate of acidification varied significantly between the strains as did their ability to form biofilms. None used glycogen as a fermentable carbohydrate. H2O2 generation was common, especially among L. jensenii isolates (88%). No bacteriocinogenic strains were detected. Most strains harbored plasmids (from 1 to 7) of various sizes, those in excess of 50 kb being frequent. One of these plasmids was found to be promiscuous since it hybridized with extrachromosomal bands of 15 isolates. All strains were resistant to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, clindamycin, trimethoprim, and sulfametoxazole and susceptible to a series of beta-lactams, erythromycin, tetracycline, and benzalkonium chloride. Almost half of the strains were highly resistant to nonoxinol 9, which is commonly used as a spermicide. Based on these analyses, strains of all three common species are proposed as new probiotic candidates.
