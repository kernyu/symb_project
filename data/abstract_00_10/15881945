The study was aimed at determining sensitivity of shigellae to antibacterial preparations and their clinical effectiveness for correcting recommendations on the empirical therapy of acute Shigella infections (ASI). The sensitivity of 164 S. flexneri strains and 80 S. sonnei strains, isolated in 1996-2003 in the Sumy region, Ukraine, was determined with respect to 19 antibacterial preparations: ampicillin (Am), tetracycline (Te), rifampicin (Ri), chloramphenicol (Ca), streptomycin (St), fusidin (Fu), kanamycin (Kn), erythromycin (Er), carbenicillin (Cb), doxycycline (Do), gentamicin (Ge), ofloxacin (Of), cefazolin (Cf), ciprofloxacin (Cp). S. flexneri and S. sonnei were found to be highly sensitive to Am (100%), Te (100%), Cb (90% and 50% respectively), Do (90% and 35% respectively), Fu (100%), Er (100%), Ri (100%), Ca (71.8% and 45% respectively), St (81% and 40% respectively). Some isolated cultures were resistant to fluorochinolones. In addition, the clinical and laboratory analysis of the effectiveness of some preparations was carried out. A total of 202 patients, divided into 6 groups, received furazolidone, chloramphenicol, norfloxacin, phthalazole, polymyxin and the combination of several antibacterial preparations. High efficiency of norfloxacin in the treatment of ASI was confirmed. The use of other preparations and their combinations was found to produce only a slight effect.
