A method of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with subsequent hyoridization on oligonucleotide microchips was worked out to identify the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and to determine simultaneously the bacterial sensitivity to 2 first-line drugs, i.e. rifampin and isoniazid. The method provides for detecting above 95% of rifampin-resistant and around 80% of isoniazid-resistant strains within 1 day.
