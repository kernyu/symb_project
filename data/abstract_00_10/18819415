In order to detect mutations in protease and reverse transcriptase regions determining the resistance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to antiretroviral drugs, sequencing of pol gene was used. Itwas concluded that HIV epidemic in Yamal region is characterized by heterogeneity of HIV-1 subtype population with trend to domination of recombinant and ground variants and spreading of mutant Mut-77 strain. Obtained results demonstrate the possibility of identification of mutations as epidemiological markers which permits their use for epidemiologic investigations.
