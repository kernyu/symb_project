OBJECTIVES: To study the incidence, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, age and sex distribution, mortality and prognostic factors in cases of Enterobacter bacteremia. METHODS: A total of 18,745 indoor patients with suspected bacteremia were included in study. Enterobacter spp were identified and speciated using standard protocols. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using Stoke's disc diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by agar dilution method as recommended by NCCLS. RESULTS: Enterobacter spp ranking sixth was responsible for 4.6% of total group of significant bacteremias. The species most commonly causing bacteremia was E. cloacae (61.8%). The bacteremia was unimicrobial in 85.1% and part of a polymicrobial bacteremia in 14.8%. Portal of entry in decreasing order of frequency were unknown, respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical wound. The most common clinical finding was fever (97.2%). Of Enterobacter isolates 72.9% were multiresistant to three or more antimicrobial agents. Overall mortality was 51.1%. CONCLUSION: Enterobacter spp are becoming increasingly important nosocomial pathogens. To prevent further emergence of multidrug resistance it may beprudent to avoid third generation cephalosporins and instead combination therapy may be used.
