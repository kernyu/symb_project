The rapid growth of proteomics that has been built upon the available bacterial genome sequences has opened provided new approaches to the analysis of bacterial functional genomics. In the study of pathogenic bacteria the combined technologies of genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics has provided valuable tools for the study of complex phenomena determined by the action of multiple gene sets. The review considers some of the recent developments in the establishment of proteomic databases as well as attempts to define pathogenic determinants at the level of the proteome for some of the major human pathogens. Proteomics can also provide practical applications through the identification of immunogenic proteins that may be potential vaccine targets as well as in extending our understanding of antibiotic action. There is little doubt that proteomics has provided us with new and valuable information on bacterial pathogens and will continue to be an important source of information in the coming years.
