Fifty-three pharyngitis-related and invasive isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes that are resistant to bacitracin were collected. They were also resistant to streptomycin, kanamycin, macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B. These multiresistant isolates were of emm type 28 and clonally related as shown by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
