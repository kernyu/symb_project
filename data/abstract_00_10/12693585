Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax is emerging in Oceania, Asia and Latin America. The drug sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine both in vivo and in vitro in the southern part of Iran was assessed; chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum has already been documented in this area. The in vitro sensitivity of 39 P. vivax isolates was assessed: the mean IC50 and IC90 were 189 ng/ml and 698 ng/ml blood respectively; for in vivo testing, all 39 vivax malaria patients were treated with a standard regimen of chloroquine and followed-up at 28 days: the mean parasite clearance time was 67.2 +/- 22.5 hours. The in vitro development of young parasites to mature schizonts in standard test medium was compared with that obtained in McCoy's 5A medium: no significant difference was observed. Synchronization of the blood-stage parasites was performed according to Lambros' method: the method was not suitable because it was detrimental to the parasites. A number of in vitro tests were performed using both our own laboratory-predosed microplates and WHO microplates: there was no significant difference between the results.
