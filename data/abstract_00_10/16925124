OBJECTIVES: Determining the frequency of antimicrobial resistance amongst bacterial isolates obtained from patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU). METHODS: Study data relating to 2001 to 2003 regarding microbiological isolates was obtained from a laboratory network for the ICUs of 14 third-level hospitals in Bogota belonging to the Bogota Bacterial Resistance Control Group (BBRCG). 27,301 isolates were obtained and their susceptibility profiles were analysed using WHONET 5.3. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS), Pseudomonas aeruginosa y Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most commonly found microorganisms. Oxacillin-resistance rate ranged from 61% at 63% during 2001 to 2003 amongst S. aureus isolates and 78% to 83% amongst coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS). E. coli resistance to third generation cephalosporines was found to be about 10% and over 20% to ciprofloxacin. K. pneumoniae isolates' resistance to third-generation cephalosporines was found to be more than 30% in 2001. P. aeruginosa resistance to all but a few antibiotics was found to be over 30% and multirresistance frequency was found to be 16% to 24%. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial resistance rates found in the ICU of hospitals in Bogota were higher than those reported in surveillance studies in the USA, Europe or other Latin-American cities.
