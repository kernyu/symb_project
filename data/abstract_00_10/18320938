Amdoxovir, currently in Phase II clinical trials, is rapidly converted to 9-(beta-D-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)guanine (DXG) by adenosine deaminase in vitro and in humans. The cellular pharmacology of DXG in primary human lymphocytes, including dose-response relationships, intracellular half-life of DXG triphosphate (DXG-TP), and combination studies were determined. DXG produced high levels of DXG-TP with a long half-life (16 h) in activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Since zidovudine (ZDV) and DXG select for different resistance mutations, co-formulation of the these two drugs is an attractive proposition. A combination study between DXG and ZDV showed no reduction of DXG-TP or ZDV-TP. Taken together, these results suggest that an appropriately designed DXG prodrug could be given once a day and that co-formulation with ZDV might be a possibility.
