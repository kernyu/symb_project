We investigated an outbreak of Acinetobacter baumannii in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital in Rome, Italy. The outbreak involved 14 patients whose isolates were most frequently recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage. All isolates were multidrug-resistant and showed diminished susceptibility or resistance to carbapenems. A. baumannii strains with a similar antibiotic susceptibility pattern were isolated from the environment. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a single clone from both the patients' and environmental isolates. Because of the lack of a single source of infection, the eradication of the epidemic required a broad approach, including contact isolation and cohorting, aggressive environmental disinfection, and close monitoring of the ward staff's performance. Infected patients were successfully treated with combined therapy. Although considered of low virulence, A. baumannii can be particularly aggressive and difficult to treat in ICU patients.
