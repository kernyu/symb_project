Methylglyoxal (MG) is a metabolite of glucose. Our previous study demonstrated an elevated MG level with an increased oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from spontaneously hypertensive rats. Whether MG causes the generation of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O2*-), leading to peroxynitrite (ONOO-) formation in VSMCs, was investigated in the present study. Cultured rat thoracic aortic SMCs (A-10) were treated with MG or other different agents. Oxidized DCF, reflecting H2O2 and ONOO- production, was significantly increased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner after the treatment of SMCs with MG (3-300 microM) for 45 min-18 h (n = 12). MG-increased oxidized DCF was effectively blocked by reduced glutathione or N-acetyl-l-cysteine, as well as L-NAME (p < 0.05, n = 12). Both O2*- scavenger SOD and NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor DPI significantly decreased MG-induced oxidized DCF formation. MG significantly and concentration-dependently increased NO and O2*- generation in A-10 cells, which was significantly inhibited by L-NAME and SOD or DPI, respectively. In conclusion, MG induces significant generation of NO and O2*- in rat VSMCs, which in turn causes ONOO- formation. An elevated MG level and the consequential ROS/RNS generation would alter cellular signaling pathways, contributing to the development of different insulin resistance states such as diabetes or hypertension.
