The controlled release of antibiotics from bone can significantly reduce the prevalence of septic complication of revision operations. Consequently, the patients could avoid further operations and the hospitals could save the cost of repeated operations, which has economic notability too. The conditions of the correct antibiotic therapy are the right indication, the use of the most appropriate antibiotic, the right dose and the adequate duration of the therapy. The spread of antibiotic resistance is particularly important in the case of long residence time in a hospital. In revision surgery, periprothetic infections are principally caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, but in most cases it is needed to reckon with multiresistance strains. In such cases, patients take antibiotics for weeks before the surgery to heal the inflammation, in order to remove the infected prosthesis in time and implant the new one.
