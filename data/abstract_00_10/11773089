Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates from 50 plasma specimens were analyzed for phenotypic susceptibility to licensed reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors by the Antivirogram and PhenoSense HIV assays. Twenty of these specimens were from recently seroconverted drug-naive persons, and 30 were from patients who were the sources of occupational exposures to HIV-1; 16 of the specimens in the latter group were from drug-experienced patients. The phenotypic results of the Antivirogram and PhenoSense HIV assays were categorized as sensitive or reduced susceptibility on the basis of the cutoff values established by the manufacturers of each assay. Data for 12 to 15 drugs were available by both assays for 38 specimens and represented a total of 529 pairs of results. The two data sets had a 91.5% concordance by phenotypic category. The discordant results (n = 45) were distributed randomly among 26 specimens and included 28 results (62.2%) which were within a twofold difference of the assay cutoff values. None of the discordant results were associated with primary resistance mutations that predicted high-level (>20-fold) resistance. Discordant results were distributed equally among specimens from drug-experienced and drug-naive individuals and were slightly higher for protease inhibitors than for nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The findings of the present study demonstrate that the results of the Antivirogram and PhenoSense HIV assays correlate well, despite the use of different testing strategies.
