Murine primary cells are poorly permissive to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vector infection. Retroviral infectivity is influenced by dominant inhibitors such as TRIM5alpha. Sensitivity to TRIM5alpha is altered by interactions between cyclophilin A and the HIV-1 capsid. Here we demonstrate that competitive inhibitors of cyclophilins, cyclosporine or the related Debio-025, stimulate HIV-1 vector transduction of primary murine cells, including bone marrow and macrophages, up to 20-fold. Unexpectedly, the infectivity of an HIV-1 mutant or a simian lentivirus that does not recruit cyclophilin A is also stimulated by these drugs. We propose that cyclosporine and related compounds will be useful tools for experimental infection of murine primary cells. It is possible that HIV-1 infection of murine cells is inhibited by dominant factors related to immunophilins.
