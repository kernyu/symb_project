Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) lipodystrophy is associated with fat redistribution, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance; however, the mechanism of insulin resistance remains unknown. We hypothesized that HIV-infected subjects with fat redistribution have increased rates of lipolysis and increased circulating free fatty acid (FFA) levels that contribute to insulin resistance. Anthrompometric and body composition data were obtained and a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed on day 1 of the study. Stable isotope infusions of glycerol and palmitate were completed following an overnight fast to assess rates of lipolysis and FFA flux in HIV-infected men (n = 19) with and without fat redistribution and healthy controls (n = 8) on day 2. Total FFA levels after standard glucose challenge were increased among HIV-infected subjects and positively associated with abdominal visceral adipose tissue area. In contrast, fasting total FFA levels were inversely associated with subcutaneous fat area. Rates of basal lipolysis were significantly increased among HIV-infected subjects (rate of appearance [Ra] glycerol, 4.1 +/- 0.2 v 3.3 +/- 0.2 micromol/kg/min in controls; P =.02). Among HIV-infected subjects, use of stavudine (P =.006) and the rate of lipolysis (ie, Ra glycerol, P =.02) were strong positive predictors of insulin resistance as measured by insulin response to glucose challenge, controlling for effects of age, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and protease inhibitor (PI) exposure. These data demonstrate increased rates of lipolysis and increased total FFA levels in HIV-infected subjects and suggest that increased lipolysis may contribute to insulin resistance in this patient population.
