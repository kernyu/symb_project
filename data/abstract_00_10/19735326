AIMS: To study a possible effect of a synthetic brominated furanone on biofilm formation and biofilm resistance to disinfectants in Salmonella enterica. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of a synthetic furanone on biofilm formation of Salm. enterica serovar Agona and Salm. enterica serovar Typhimurium (11 strains of different origins) was evaluated in a microtiterplate assay. A significant reduction in biofilm build-up in microtiterplates by the furanone was observed for seven of the strains tested. Biofilms by two Salm. Agona feed factory strains and the effects on survival after exposures to disinfectants (hypochlorite and benzalkonium chloride) were assessed for both strains. Pretreatment with furanone significantly potentiated the effect of the two disinfectants for both strains. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of disinfectants on Salmonella in biofilm was significantly enhanced when the biofilm was grown in the presence of furanone. This was probably because of an effect on biofilm architecture, composition and in some cases also biofilm build-up. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present study gives valuable new knowledge in the fight against Salmonella biofilm in the environment because of the potentiated effect of conventional disinfectants.
