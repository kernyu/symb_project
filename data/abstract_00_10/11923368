Infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are increasingly a main health concern worldwide for hospitalized patients. In addition, the prevalence of community-acquired infection has risen continuously during the last few years. Some MRSA clones spread easier than others within the hospital environment and therefore are frequently implicated in outbreaks. Thus, the spread of a unique epidemic multiresistant clone, the so-called South American clone, is the main cause of nosocomial infections produced by this bacterium in Brazil and in some regions of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. In the present work we describe the identification of a novel clone of MRSA that is involved in nosocomial infections and that shows a prevalence as high as that for the South American clone. A total of 53 consecutive single-patient MRSA isolates were recovered during a 3-month period (May to July 1999) from six different hospitals (955 beds) in Cordoba. The isolates were initially typed according the antibiotic resistance and phage susceptibility patterns, followed by genotyping using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE analysis of the 53 MRSA isolates revealed six major types (A to F) and 25 subtypes. The B-type DNA pattern was indistinguishable from that of the South American epidemic clone observed in 34% of the isolates. A novel highly prevalent clone, showing the A-type DNA pattern and representing 38% of the isolates, was also identified. Moreover, the most frequent subtype of the A clonal family triggered an outbreak in a hospital 2 months later, further confirming its epidemic feature.
