A new chromosome-carried quinolone resistance gene from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Smqnr, was characterized. The gene was present in type strain CCUG 5866 and was also detected in 24 clinical isolates and showed some allelic diversity. The expression of Smqnr in Escherichia coli decreased the susceptibilities of the E. coli isolates to several fluoroquinolones.
