Ceftobiprole, formerly designated BAL9141/Ro 63-9141, is a pyrrolidinone-3-ylidene-methyl cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ceftobiprole has a low potential for inducing chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases but it is hydrolyzed by most extended spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases. Glomerular filtration is predominantly responsible for removal of the free drug from the systemic circulation. The efficacy of ceftobiprole in the treatment of complicated skin and ski-structure infections has been recently demonstrated in two Phase III randomized clinical trials involving 1600 patients. Two other Phase III clinical trials to assess ceftobiprole's efficacy in community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia have also concluded. While the drug met the noninferiority criteria for community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia involving non-ventilator associated pneumonia, ceftobiprole was less effective than the comparator in ventilator associated pneumonia subjects. Ceftobiprole was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with the cephalosporin class of antibiotic. The most frequent drug-related adverse event was dysgeusia. Ceftobiprole is intended for use in the hospital for the treatment of infections that frequently involve beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms.
