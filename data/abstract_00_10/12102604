Antibiotic resistance appearance and spread have been classically considered the result of a process of natural selection, directed by the use of antibiotics. Bacteria, that have to face the antibiotic challenge, evolve to acquire resistance and, under this strong selective pressure, only the fittest survive, leading to the spread of resistance mechanisms and resistant clones. Horizontal transference of resistance mechanisms seems to be the main way of antibiotic resistance acquisition. Nevertheless, recent findings on hypermutability and antibiotic-induced hypermutation in bacteria have modified the landscape. Here, we present a review of the last data on molecular mechanisms of hypermutability in bacteria and their relationship with the acquisition of antibiotic resistance. Finally, we discuss the possibility that antibiotics may act not only as selectors for antibiotic resistant bacteria but also as resistance promoters.
