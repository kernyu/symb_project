Hemostasis obtained by manual compression after femoral artery catheterization results in consistently low rates of major complications. A rare complication of femoral artery catheterization is arterial infection. Its occurrence after diagnostic angiography using manual compression has not been reported. We report two cases of femoral arterial infection after uneventful diagnostic catheterization in nonimmunocompromised patients using the Perclose percutaneous arterial closure device. Our cases are representative of Perclose associated infections, with delayed presentation of a staphylococcal arterial infection requiring arterial debridement and reconstruction. This article indicates that Perclose use carries a risk of severe arterial infection. Surgeons should be aware of the potential infectious complications associated with Perclose use and the need for aggressive treatment.
