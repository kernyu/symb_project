Experiments were performed with two strains of plague bacteria--231 (isolated from marmot) and 358 (isolated from human) and their isogenic variants with Fra- and Fra-Tox- phenotype. Mutants resistant to rifampicin (Rifr) and nalidixic acid (Nalr) appeared independently of pathogen phenotype and genotype with frequency n.10(-8)-n.10(-9), subsequently. Rifr mutation influenced on virulence manifestation at albino mice and antigendeficient variants with Fra- and Fra-Tox- phenotype. In every group of strains highly virulent subcultures were registered. Resistance to nalidixic acid mainly was not associated with virulence loss. Nalr mutants of parent and antigenmodified mutants were cross resistant to fluoroqinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, lomefloxacin). LD50 for untreated albino mice did not differ from LD50, for mice treated with rifampicin (when mice were infected with strain resistant to rifampicin) or with nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones (when animals were infected with Nalr mutants). Antigenmodified strains of plague bacteria and their Rifr, Nalr mutants were able to overcome specific immune reaction. The drugs should be used in synergic combinations (with aminoglycosides or cephalosporines of III generation) to prevent appearance of virulent strains resistant to rifampicin and fluroquinolones.
