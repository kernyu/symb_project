OBJECTIVES: High serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels have been demonstrated to increase the probability of a sustained viral response (SVR) in chronic hepatitis C. Conversely, insulin resistance reduces SVR rates. We investigated the influence of baseline glucose and lipid values on the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment in HIV-1 infected subjects. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients treated with an interferon-based regimen from 2002 to 2008. Fasting glucose levels and total cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride levels were recorded prior to the initiation of treatment. RESULTS: Of the 96 patients enrolled in the study, 36 (37.5%) had genotype 1, 48 (50%) genotype 2 or 3 and 12 (12.5%) genotype 4. SVR was obtained in 25% (nine of 36) and 70% (42 of 60) of patients with genotype 1 and other genotypes, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of SVR were: genotype other than genotype 1 [adjusted odds ratio 9.64, confidence interval (CI) 2.7-34.3; P<0.0001], HCV viraemia [adjusted odds ratio 0.36, CI 0.15-0.9; P=0.028], fasting glucose > or =100 mg/dL [adjusted odds ratio 0.13, CI 0.034-0.51; P=0.003], and cholesterol level > or =190 mg/dL [adjusted odds ratio 5.96, CI 1.6-22.3; P=0.008]. CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline serum glucose and cholesterol levels may be significant prognostic indicators for anti-HCV treatment outcome in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients.
