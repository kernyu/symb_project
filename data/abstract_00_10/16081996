Mupirocin MICs and mupA presence were determined in 108 staphylococci causing prosthetic joint infection. Zero of 35 isolates (0%) of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 4/15 (27%) methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates, 3/16 (19%) methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, and 11/42 (26%) methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were mupirocin resistant. mupA was detected in all five high-level mupirocin-resistant staphylococci and one mupirocin-susceptible staphylococcus.
