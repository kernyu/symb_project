In the course of a chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus, the fibrosis progression rate varies among individuals, and depends on the existence of certain co-factors. In this context, a growing interest has emerged and has focused on insulin resistance. In fact, the hepatitis C virus is now recognized as being responsible for a direct interference with the insulin signalling pathway. This insulin resistance of viral origin, in combination with an eventual insulin resistance associated with an existing metabolic syndrome, can therefore accelerate its evolution to a type II diabetes. Independently of its pathogenesis, insulin resistance occurring in chronic hepatitis C causes a fatty liver, contributes to the progression towards cirrhosis, and narrows the chances of a successful antiviral therapy. It is therefore crucial to recognize it in order to correct it.
