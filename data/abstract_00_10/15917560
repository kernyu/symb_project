A novel beta-lactamase gene, blaOXA-61, from Campylobacter jejuni GC015 was cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. blaOXA-61 encodes a protein of 257 amino acids in which the active-site STFK tetrad and conserved class D beta-lactamase motifs YGN and KTG were identified. A conserved sequence upstream of blaOXA-61 is required for expression in Campylobacter.
