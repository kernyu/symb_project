Urea and thiourea derivatives of oxazolidinones were synthesized and their inhibitory activity (MIC) was determined on the bacterial strains which includes clinical isolates and quality control organisms. The structure activity relationships were studied and a 3D-QSAR model was built using Genetic Function Approximation. Interestingly found that electron withdrawing groups at the ortho position of the phenyl ring enhances the activity.
