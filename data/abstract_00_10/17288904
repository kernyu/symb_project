INTRODUCTION: Resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and type B streptogramins (MLSB) in Staphylococcus isolates can be due to several mechanisms. The most important are an active efflux mechanism (MSB phenotype) and ribosomal target modification (MLSB phenotype); this latter mechanism confers resistance to all three groups of antimicrobials (MLSB resistance). Expression of MLSB resistance can be constitutive (cMLSB) or inducible (iMLSB). METHODS: A group of 117 erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. clinical isolates from cutaneous samples were selected from 536 recent clinical isolates of this microorganism. Resistance phenotypes were determined by the double disk diffusion test. Presence of the ermA, ermC, ermB and msrA genes was detected by real time PCR. RESULTS: The MSB phenotype was the most common, comprising 11.2% (7.2% in S. aureus and 23% in CoNS) of the erythromycin-resistant strains. The rate of iMLSB resistance was significantly higher, 7.4% (5.2% in S. aureus and 14% in CoNS), than the rate of cMLSB resistance, 3.2% (1.7% in S. aureus and 7.4% in CoNS). The msrA gene was present in all isolates with the MSB phenotype, and the ermC gene was the most common among clindamycin-resistant strains with the MLSB phenotype (constitutive or inducible). CONCLUSION: The good correlation between the phenotypic (disk-diffusion) and genotypic (real time PCR) methods used allows prediction of the mechanisms of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance, provides insight into the epidemiological differences in their distribution, and is an aid to selecting the most appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
