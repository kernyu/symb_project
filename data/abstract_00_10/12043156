As revealed in this study, S. sonnei population is represented by two clusters with respect to the sensitivity to different antibiotics. A higher degree of diversity was observed with respect to the action of streptomycin, kefzol, ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin in comparison with the action of gentamicin, nevigramon, rafampicin, tetracycline and polymyxin. The level of diversity of S. sonnei with respect to the sensitivity to antibiotics under study underwent essential changes during the calendar year. The distributions obtained study quite closely corresponded to changes in Sonne dysentery morbidity observed within the year period: the first cluster corresponded to the period of morbidity between the seasons and the second one, to the seasonal period of morbidity. The minimal coefficient of diversity fell on May while the maximum--on September. The minimal level of S. sonnei diversity, as a rule, corresponds to the minimum biosystems stability.
