BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effect of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and post-OLT immunosuppression on the disease course of pouchitis is not clear. The aims of this study were to compare the frequency of chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis (CARP) in PSC patients with or without OLT and to assess potential risk factors for CARP in these patients. METHODS: Ulcerative colitis patients with PSC and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) with or without OLT identified from our prospectively maintained pouch database were analyzed. CARP was diagnosed based on persistent symptomatic pouchitis after a 4-week single- or dual-antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: A total of 63 PSC/IPAA patients were studied, including 19 patients with OLT and 44 patients without OLT. Fifty patients (79.4%) had CARP. In both univariable and multivariable analyses (adjusting for OLT status), none of the variables studied was associated significantly with CARP (P > .20). All 7 patients (100%) with IPAA-then-OLT were diagnosed as having CARP, of whom 4 developed CARP before OLT, which persisted after OLT, and 3 had CARP after OLT. Of 12 patients with OLT-then-IPAA, 7 (58.3%) developed CARP. The frequency of CARP in OLT-then-IPAA was statistically significantly lower than that in IPAA-then-OLT (58.3% vs 100%; P = .047). CONCLUSIONS: CARP is common in patients with ulcerative colitis and PSC. OLT in these patients may not affect the frequency of CARP in general and appears not to alter the disease course of pre-existing CARP. However, in a subset of patients, OLT might reduce the risk for the development of de novo CARP.
