OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine the bacterial aetiology of lower respiratory tract infections in this environment as well as update the clinicians in the various antimicrobial alternatives available in the treatment. METHODS: Between September 2002 and February 2005, 157 bacterial pathogens from 556 patients with lower respiratory tract infections were isolated from sputum specimens, and subjected to susceptibility testing, using standard bacteriologic techniques. RESULTS: Out of the 556 cases, only 150 (27%) had an established bacterial aetiology. One pathogen was demonstrated in 143 (95.3%) patients and seven (4.7%) had mixed infections. The most prevalent single pathogen was Klebsiella pneumoniae (38%) while the most prevalent bacterial combination was Klebsiella and Pseudomonas species (2%). Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and ceftriaxone. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteriological diagnosis and antibiotic resistance surveillance are indispensable in the effective management of lower respiratory tract infections.
