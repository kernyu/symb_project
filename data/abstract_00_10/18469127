Organic-solvent tolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain KK-211, which was first isolated as an organic-solvent-tolerant strain, depends on point mutation (R821S) of the transcription factor Pdr1p. The integration of the PDR1 R821S mutation into wild-type yeast results in organic-solvent tolerance, and the PDR1 R821S mutant can reduce carbonyl compounds in organic solvents.
