OBJECTIVE: To investigate the change in the antibiotic resistant spectrum of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) isolated from burn wounds and the production of inducible beta-lactamase. METHODS: VITEK-AMS system (total automatic bacterial identification and drug sensitivity system) and E-test concentration gradient were employed to perform bacterial identification and antibiotic sensitivity tests. K-B method was applied to detect inducible enzyme. RESULTS: The resistance of PA to Cephalosporin and Imipenem was increased in the past 4 years from June of 1996 to June of 2000. Whereas the resistance to Cefoperazone/Sulbactam was least. There was an obvious difference of the resistance of PA to antibiotics during the 4 years (P < 0.05). The resistant rate to Imipenem ranged from 20% to 40%. PA was able to produce inducible enzymes among 120 strains of wild type of PA occupying 72.5% with Imipenam as the inducing agent. CONCLUSION: The analysis of the antibiotic resistance of PA and the detection of inducible enzymes could be monitored from time to time and helpful in the correction of the use of antibiotics. Constant monitoring of antibiotic resistance might be beneficial to the prevention of outbreak of epidemics of PA infection in a burn unit.
