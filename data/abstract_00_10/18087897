This study was conducted to determine frequency and pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility of Shigella species isolated from stool specimens collected from patients presenting with bloody diarrhoea in Mwanza City, Tanzania. The study was carried out from October 2004 to October 2005 and involved patients attending Sekou Toure Regional Hospital and Butimba Health Centre. Bacteriological cultures were done at the National Institute for Medical Research laboratory. A total of 489 patients (median age = 20 years) participated in the study and were able to provide stool specimens. Shigella species were isolated from 14% (69/489) of the stool specimens collected. Of the sixty nine strains of Shigella spp isolated, 62 (90%) were S. flexneri and 7 (10%) were S. dysenteriae. All Shigella strains isolated showed high resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and chloramphenicol, drugs commonly used for management of shigellosis in Tanzania. However all isolates were fully susceptible to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, erythromycin, cefuroxime and gentamycin. S. flexneri showed resistance to amoxy-clavulanic_acid and azithromycin in 5% and 2% of isolates, respectively. None of the S. dysenteriae isolates were resistant to these two drugs. Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia and Schistosoma mansoni were microscopically detected in 16.5%, 4.4% and 5.3% of patients, respectively. These findings suggest that there is a need to carry out extensive susceptibility studies in different parts of the country with view of re-appraising the current guidelines for management of bloody diarrhoea in Tanzania.
