Poxviruses, unlike some other large DNA viruses, do not undergo a latent stage but rely on the expression of viral proteins to evade host immune responses. Of the many poxviral evasion genes identified, most target cytokines or other innate immune defenses. Resistance to interferons appears to be a priority as there are viral proteins that prevent their induction, receptor binding, and action. Additional poxviral proteins inhibit complement activation, chemokines, IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor. The identification of viral immune evasion genes and the determination of their roles in virus survival and spread contribute to our understanding of immunology and microbiology.
