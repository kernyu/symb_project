Ten Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates producing CTX-M-2 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were identified from clinical and poultry sources in two distant cities in Brazil between 2003 and 2004. They included two isolates from pediatric patients and eight isolates from poultry or its environment. All isolates exhibited coresistance to non-beta-lactam antimicrobials including tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The CTX-M-2 gene was located on transferable plasmids with sizes between 90 and 170 kb that also carried other resistance determinants in some isolates. By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the genetic similarity of the isolates including clinical and poultry ones ranged from 89% to 100%.
