We compared the results of two typing methods for 678 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism typing of the coagulase gene was a more reliable method than coagulase serotyping from the viewpoint of arbekacin resistance.
