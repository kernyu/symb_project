Great differences were found in the level of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 40-46 kDa (OAS1) mRNA in relation to the proliferative state of human diploid fibroblasts at the moment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) (the strain AD169) infection. In the phase of synthesis of cellular cycle DNA (S), CMV induced OAS1 mRNA transcription by 10-100 times stronger than then in phase Go infection. The level of viral induction OAS1 mRNA peaked by hour 12 postinfection. The high gene activity correlated with suppressed DNA synthesis, a slowing-down mitotic cycle, markedly inhibited CMV replication, and delayed cell death. When the cells were infected in phase Go, the stimulation of OAS1 gene activity was less and it was attended by intensive viral replication and rapid cell death. There was a direct relationship between the resistance of cells and the constitutive level of OAS1 gene expression: in the low CMV-sensitive cells, the activity of OAS1 gene was more than 10 times greater than that in the highly sensitive cells. The inhibitors of the enzymatic OAS activity induced by IFN and dsRNA were found in the cytoplasm of the CMV-infected cells.
