BACKGROUND: Conditional gene regulatory systems ensuring tight and adjustable expression of therapeutic genes are central for developing future gene therapy strategies. Among various regulatory systems, tetracycline-controlled gene expression has emerged as a safe and reliable option. Moreover, the tightness of tetracycline-regulated gene switches can be substantially improved by complementing transcriptional activators with antagonizing repressors. METHODS: To develop novel tetracycline-responsive transcriptional repressors, we fused various transcriptional silencing domains to the TetR (B/E) DNA-binding and dimerization domain of the Tn10-encoded tetracycline resistance operon (TetR (B/E)). The resulting fusion proteins were individually tested for their ability to repress transcription of the constitutively active hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) promoter. In addition, compatibility with the commonly used reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator system (rtTA-system) and responsiveness to the pharmacological effector doxycycline (DOX) were evaluated. Finally, inducibility, effector-dependent promoter activity and the modification of histone H3 and H4 of the active versus the repressed target promoter were determined. RESULTS: Fusion of the human deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) carboxy-terminal silencing domain to TetR (B/E) resulted in a functional transcriptional repressor. This novel repressor, termed tTS-H4, efficiently reduced the activity of the murine HPRT promoter and a constitutively active human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) minimal promoter. Furthermore, combining tTS-H4 with the rtTA transcriptional activator allowed for grading, turning off and resuming target gene expression over several orders of magnitude without background. CONCLUSIONS: The tTS-H4 repressor is compatible with the commonly used rtTA transcriptional activation system and is a versatile new tool for tightly and adjustably regulating conditional gene expression.
