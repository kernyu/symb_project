Thalidomide is a potent anti-myeloma drug which can produce up to a 30-50% overall response rate (ORR) in pre-treated, chemorefractory multiple myeloma. Most authors agree with using 200 mg/daily with associated high dose dexamethasone (40 mg/daily x 4 days, 3 times monthly) considering lower doses investigational. We report our experience using thalidomide 100 mg/daily plus dexamethasone 40 mg/daily once a month, in 27 pre-treated patients. Thalidomide dose excalation and/or association with other drugs were established on the basis of the patient's response. Median age was 69 years (range 50-83 years) and 16 male and 11 female patients were treated. All patients had received more than 1 treatment line (range 1-5). Thalidomide was increased up to 300 mg/daily in 10 patients and 1 patient received up to 400 mg/daily. Two patients were not evaluable because of early death, 1 did not tolerate thalidomide because of pulmonary and neurological side-effects. Sixteen patients responded to this treatment, with an ORR of 66%. The combination of low-dose thalidomide plus monthly high-dose dexamethasone in chemorefractory myeloma showed interesting palliative results. According to our data, increasing thalidomide dosage and/or adding further drugs does not generally produce significant improvement.
