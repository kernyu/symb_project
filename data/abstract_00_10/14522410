Cardiovascular complications in the course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are multifactorial and may be caused by the virus itself or by the related opportunistic infections and neoplasms. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has prolonged many patients' lives, but many cardiac sequelae of HIV are not affected by HAART and continue to develop even with treatment. In addition, HAART itself causes in a high proportion of patients a metabolic syndrome, characterized by lipodystrophy/lipoatrophy, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance that may be associated with an increase in peripheral artery and coronary artery diseases. Careful cardiovascular evaluation in the course of HIV disease can identify cardiac complications early enough to treat. All HIV-infected patients candidate to antiretroviral therapy and patients already under treatment should undergo an assessment that includes the evaluation of the cardiovascular risk with the available guidelines.
