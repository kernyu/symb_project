Neutralising antibodies develop in 15% of interferon-beta (IFNbeta)-treated patients, causing the reduction of the clinical effects of the treatment. This is the first study that shows that switching patients from IFNbeta to glatiramer acetate (GA) in case of neutralising antibodies (NAb) positivity is effective in reducing relapse rate and in delaying the time to first relapse. In conclusion, our data suggest the use of GA in NAb-positive patients.
