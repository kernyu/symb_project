During May to July 2004, three strains of Providencia spp. with multidrug-resistance (MDR) were isolated from urinary specimen of three patients hospitalized with a same hospital room. By PCR analysis, all three strains have been found to carry both VIM-2 type metallo-beta-lactamase gene and PER-1 type extendedspectrum beta-lactamase gene. One out of three strains carried additional resistance gene, armA, 16S rRNA methylase gene responsible for high level resistance to aminoglycosides. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification of Providencia spp. simultaneously carrying blaVIM-2, blaPER-1, and armA genes.
