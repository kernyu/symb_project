Discovery of novel antimicrobial agents effective against infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens is an important objective. In order to find a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, which has potent antibacterial activity especially against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, a series of 1beta-methylcarbapenems with thiazol-2-ylthio groups at the C-2 position have been synthesized. Structure-activity relationships were investigated which led to SM-197436 (27), SM-232721 (44) and SM-232724 (41), being selected for further evaluation.
