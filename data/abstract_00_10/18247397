The Agrobacterium -mediated transformation was adapted to Backusella lamprospora, a zygomycete fungus closely related to Mucor. The transforming plasmid contained the hygromycin B resistance (hph) and the green fluorescent protein (gfp) genes under the control of the regulator regions of the Mucor circinelloides gpd1 gene. The presence of the hph and gfp genes in the transformants was detected by PCR. The introduced genes could also be amplified directly from the spores of the transformants. The transformation efficiency was investigated by fluorescence microscopy of the transformed spores. A gradual decrease in the hygromycin B resistance was observed during several cultivation cycles: the growth of the transformants on the selection medium became slower, and the detection of the introduced gene became more difficult.
