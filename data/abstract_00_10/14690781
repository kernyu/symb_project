OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical and microbiologic characteristics of pneumococcal bacteremia at Sanatorio Mitre, Buenos Aires, Argentina. METHODS: One-hundred-and-seven episodes of pneumococcal bacteremia were prospectively analyzed from 1993 to 1998. Demographics, clinical and microbiological variables were studied. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients (76%) were adults and 26 children (24%). Most cases (98%) were acquired in the community. Seventy-nine patients (74%) had at least one underlying condition. The primary source of bacteremia was found in 91 patients (85%), the lungs being the most common source. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from one sterile site other than the primary focus in 25 patients (23%). Eighty-five (79%) of the Streptococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to penicillin and 22 (21%) showed intermediate or high resistance to penicillin and 2% were additionally resistant to ceftriaxone. Initial antimicrobial therapy was appropriate in 95% of the cases. The overall mortality was 21%, however adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) had higher mortality (81%). No patients under 14 years old died. Multivariate analysis showed that age and recovery of the organisms from a sterile site other than the primary focus were statistically significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION: Bacteremic pneumococcal infections continue to be an important worldwide problem causing morbidity and high mortality despite supportive care and appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
