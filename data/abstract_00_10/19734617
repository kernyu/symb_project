BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is a major cause of nosocomial infections in many hospitals and appears to have a propensity for developing multiple antimicrobial resistance rapidly. CASES: We report two cases with post-surgical meningitis due to multidrug resistant A. baumannii which were successfully treated with high-dose intravenous meropenem therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Multidrug resistant Acinetobacter spp. in intensive care units are a growing concern. High-dose meropenem is used in the treatment of these infections.
