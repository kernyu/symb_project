Transposons closely related to the streptomycin resistance transposon of modem bacteria, Tn5393, were detected in the bacterial isolates from permafrost resistant to streptomycin. Many transposons studied were located on the medium-size plasmids with a narrow host range. None of the streptomycin-resistant strains isolated from permafrost contained small plasmids carrying the strA-strB genes and related to the broad host range plasmid RSF1010.
