A clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to produce a clavulanic acid-inhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase with a pI of 6.4. PCR, cloning, and sequencing experiments showed that the corresponding bla(TEM-21) gene was part of a chromosomally located Tn801 transposon disrupted by an IS6100 element and adjacent to an aac(3)-II gene.
