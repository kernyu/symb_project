Pesticide resistance has parallels with multi-drug resistance syndrome of tumours in clinical medicine, which has been linked to an ATP-dependent pump, p-glycoprotein (P-gp). P-gps pump drugs out of the cell, thereby reducing cellular concentrations of the chemical. P-gps have been found in several invertebrate species and have been shown to provide a defence against environmental xenobiotics, including pesticides. This study used a model cell culture system to investigate the interaction of pesticides with P-gp. Ivermectin and endosulfan were shown to be strong inhibitors of dye transport out of cells, which is a standard measure of P-gp modulation. We then investigated the action of a P-gp inhibitor, verapamil (calcium channel blocker), on insecticide toxicity to fourth-instar mosquito larvae of the Culex pipiens L. complex (Diptera: Culicidae). Verapamil increased toxicity to examples of three insecticide classes (cypermethrin, endosulfan, ivermectin), but not to chlorpyrifos (organophosphate). The discovery of a novel protective mechanism in mosquitoes, with a wide substrate range, has implications for the control of important pest and vector species.
