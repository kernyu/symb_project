A series of G6-amino derivatives of a lipophilic vancomycin analogue was prepared. Antibacterial activity of the analogues was inversely proportional to the degree of substitution of the G6-nitrogen. The fully substituted (quaternary) analogues were essentially inactive against vanA phenotype VREF strains but retained substantial activity against other bacteria, a profile reminiscent of teicoplanin.
