The recommended treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection is a seven-day course of the following regimen: a double dose proton-pump inhibitor (omeprazole 2 x 20 mg, or lansoprazole 2 x 30 mg, or pantoprazole 2 x 40 mg), associated with 2 antibiotics (amoxicillin 2 x 1,000 mg, clarithromycin 2 x 500 mg). Eradication rate is around 65%. Main causes of failure are antibiotic resistance, bad compliance, early termination of therapy due to adverse events. A second line treatment is possible with substitution of clarithromycine by metronidazole (3 x 500 mg), a longer duration of treatment (14 days) and sometimes a quadritherapy with bismuth (not available in France).
