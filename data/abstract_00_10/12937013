The levels of effectiveness of linezolid, vancomycin, and the combination of linezolid and vancomycin were compared in the rabbit model of endocarditis caused by a clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolate. Vancomycin alone was more effective than either linezolid alone or the combination of linezolid and vancomycin for the treatment of endocarditis due to MRSA.
