Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) substantially alters the natural course of HBV infection as well as its management. Therapy for HBV infection in HIV-coinfected patients requires several factors to be taken into consideration, such as whether the antiviral activity of a particular agent is specific for HBV (that is, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine and pegylated interferon) or for both viruses (that is, lamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir), whether the chosen drug has the potential for inducing drug resistance and cross-resistance, and whether use of the agent is associated with hepatotoxicity. For coinfected patients who do not require therapy for their HIV infection, clinicians should avoid prescribing monotherapy with agents that have activity against HIV (that is, tenofovir, entecavir, emtricitabine or lamivudine) so as not to compromise future HIV care. This review discusses the current status of treatment of hepatitis B in the setting of HIV infection. It describes emerging therapeutic strategies and addresses challenges in the treatment of coinfection.
