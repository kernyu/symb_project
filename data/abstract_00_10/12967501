An imipenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae isolate was recovered from the blood of a patient with a hematologic malignancy. Analytical isoelectric focusing, inhibitor studies, hydrolysis, induction assays, and molecular sequencing methods confirmed the presence of a NmcA carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzyme. This first report of NmcA detected in North America warrants further investigation into its distribution and clinical impact.
