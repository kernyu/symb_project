Serratia marcescens is a nosocomial agent with a natural resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics, making the treatment of its infections very challenging. This study examines the influence of salicylate, sucrose, temperature, and pH variability on membrane permeability and susceptibility of S. marcescens to norfloxacin (hydrophilic fluoroquinolone) and nalidixic acid (hydrophobic quinolone). Resistance of wild-type S. marcescens UOC-67 (ATCC 13880) to norfloxacin and nalidixic acid was assessed by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays after growth in the presence of various concentrations of sucrose and salicylate and different temperatures and pH values. Norfloxacin and nalidixic acid accumulation was determined in the absence and presence of (i) carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a proton-motive-force collapser, and (ii) Phe-Arg beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN), an efflux pump inhibitor. Accumulation of norfloxacin decreased when S. marcescens was grown in high concentrations of salicylate (8 mmol/L) and sucrose (10% m/v), at high temperature (42 degrees C), and at pH 6, and it was restored in the presence of CCCP because of the collapse of proton-gradient-dependent efflux in S. marcescens. Although nalidixic acid accumulation was observed, it was not affected by salicylate, sucrose, pH, or temperature changes. In the absence of PAbetaN, and either in the presence or absence of CCCP, a plateau was reached in the nalidixic acid accumulation for all environmental conditions. With the addition of 20 mg/L PAbetaN nalidixic acid accumulation is restored for all environmental conditions, suggesting that this quinolone is recognized by a yet to be identified S. marcescens pump that does not use proton motive force as its energy source.
