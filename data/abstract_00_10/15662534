The clinical picture in vasculitis varies from few self-limiting symptoms to life-threatening illnesses affecting multiple organs. We describe the course of a woman patient who had had a severe cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis for more than 10 years. Various immunsuppressants, including cyclophosphamide, had failed to improve the clinical course, although adequate doses were given for a sufficient period. Treatment with DADPS (diaminodiphenylsulfone, dapsone), however, finally led to complete remission of the severe and chronic vasculitic ulcerations. Indications for DADPS treatment of inflammatory cutaneous diseases are discussed, and an overview of cutaneous vasculitis is provided.
