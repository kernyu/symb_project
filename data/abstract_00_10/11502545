We report two South African serotype 6B pneumococcal isolates with cephalosporin resistance, yet with susceptibility to penicillin. DNA fingerprinting revealed that they were clonal in origin. pbp 2X and 1A genes showed major alterations typical of cephalosporin-resistant pneumococci. The pbp 2B gene was completely unaltered, explaining the penicillin susceptibility of the isolates.
