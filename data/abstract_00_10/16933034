Angiotensin II (Ang II), a major regulator of blood pressure, is also involved in the control of cellular proliferation and hypertrophy and might exhibit additional actions in vivo by modulating the signaling of other hormones. As hypertension and Insulin (Ins) resistance often coexist and are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, Ang II and Insulin signaling cross-talk may have an important role in hypertension development. The effect of Ins on protein tyrosine phosphorylation was assayed in rat liver membrane preparations, a rich source of Ins receptors. Following stimulation, Ins (10(-7) M) induced tyr-phosphorylation of different proteins. Insulin consistently induced tyr-phosphorylation of a 160 kDa protein (pp160) with maximum effect between 1 and 3 min. The pp160 protein was identified by anti-IRS-4 but not by anti-IRS-1 antibody. Pre-stimulation with Ang II (10(-7) M) diminishes tyr-phosphorylation level of pp160/IRS-4 in a dose-dependent manner. Okadaic acid, the PP1A and PP2A Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor, increases pp160 phosphorylation induced by Ins and prevents the inhibitory effect of Ang II pre-stimulation. Genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, diminishes tyr-phosphorylation level of IRS-4. PI3K inhibitors Wortmanin and LY294002, both increase tyr-phosphorylation of IRS-4, either in the presence of Ins alone or combined with Ang II. These results suggest that Ins and Ang II modulate IRS-4 tyr-phosphorylation in a PI3K-dependent manner. In summary, we showed that Ins induces tyr-phosphorylation of IRS-4, an effect modulated by Ang II. Assays performed in the presence of different inhibitors points toward a PI3K involvement in this signaling pathway.
