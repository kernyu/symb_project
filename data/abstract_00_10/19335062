BACKGROUND: Malaria is caused by the intracellular parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The constant need for novel malaria therapies is due to the development of resistance against existing drugs. OBJECTIVE: To summarise attempts to investigate parasitic aquaporins as drug targets in malaria. METHODS: Starting with a summary of the history of malaria we present aquaporin structure and function relationships. Potential interactions of inhibitors with plasmodial AQP (PfAQP) are discussed. PfAQP blockage is examined in the light of recent work on knock-out parasites. Since PfAQP is able to transport other small solutes the parasites are sensitive to other compounds which are harmless to the human host. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Total blockage of PfAQP may not lead to the death of the parasite but application of PfAQP as a vehicle for toxic substances may be a further pathway for research.
