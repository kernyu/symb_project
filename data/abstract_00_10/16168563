Anthelmintic efficacies against juvenile developing populations of Teladorsagia species that were known to be resistant to anthelmintics from all three broad spectrum families were examined using a controlled efficacy test. Fenbendazole (FBZ), levamisole (LEV), ivermectin (IVM), combinations of these anthelmintics and moxidectin (MOX) were assessed in parasite naive lambs artificially infected with 8,000 third stage larvae (Tci5) and treated orally 8-day post-infection with the compounds at the manufacturers recommended dose rates, FBZ, 5 mg/kg body weight (BW); LEV, 7.5 mg/kg BW; IVM, 0.2 mg/kg BW; MOX (0.2 mg/kg BW). The lambs were slaughtered 14-day post-treatment. The arithmetic mean worm burden reductions resulting from oral treatments with FBZ; IVM; LEV; FBZ+IVM; FBZ+LEV; FBZ, LEV+IVM or MOX were 36%, 82%, 38%, 86%, 60%, 88% and 97%, respectively. The results illustrate that combination treatments showed improved efficacies against the juvenile population compared to individually administered treatments but that these improvements were not wholly effective. Moxidectin was the only treatment that was over 95% effective, though caution should be noted when advising the use of MOX prophylactically since 3% of the infection still survived this treatment. Treatments directed at juvenile stages of Tci5 were less effective, with the exception of IVM, compared to a similar trial using Tci5 where the same treatments were directed against a predominantly adult population. No interaction was detected comparing the timings of treatments and its effectiveness with the exception of IVM (two-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). These findings suggest that, on the whole, the selection processes for anthelmintic resistance (AR) may occur at an early stage of development within the parasites, having severe implications for the early detection of AR.
