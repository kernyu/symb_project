Staphylococcus aureus strain HMC3 isolated at the Hershey Medical Center, was resistant to vancomycin (VRSA) through the presence of the vanA resistance gene; it also contained mecA, erm(A), erm(B), tet(K) and aac(6')-aph(2"), conferring resistance to licensed beta-lactams, macrolides, tetracycline and aminoglycosides. HMC3 also had alterations in GyrA and GrlB and was resistant to available quinolones. Experimental drugs with low MICs (<2 mg/L) for VRSA HMC3 included cephalosporins BAL9141 and RWJ-54428; glycopeptides oritavancin and dalbavancin; the lipopeptide daptomycin; the glycolipodepsipeptide ramoplanin; new fluoroquinolones WCK 771 A, WCK 1153, DK-507k and sitafloxacin; and the DNA nanobinder GS02-02. These agents were all bactericidal as were trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and teicoplanin (MIC 4 mg/L). Oxazolidinones linezolid and ranbezolid; the injectable streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin; DNA nanobinders GS2-10547 and GS02-104; peptide deformylase inhibitors NVP-PDF713 and GS02-12; tetracycline derivative tigecycline; the antifolate iclaprim; mupirocin and fusidic acid were all active in vitro but bacteriostatic.
