A Staphylococcus aureus strain with low-level heteroresistance to vancomycin (designated MER) but susceptible to methicillin was isolated from an outpatient with conjunctivitis who did not receive any glycopeptide antibiotics. Incubation of the parent strain, MER, with increasing concentrations of vancomycin led to rapid selection of a stable progeny homogeneously resistant to vancomycin. Electron micrographs of strain MER showed enhanced cell wall thickness and abnormal septations typically seen with methicillin-resistant S. aureus having intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin.
