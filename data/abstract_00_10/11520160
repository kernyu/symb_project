BACKGROUND: Yolk sac tumors of the ovary are generally very responsive to chemotherapy; however, they are difficult to manage in the setting of platinum resistance where treatment options are limited and outcomes are poorer. CASE: We present a 39-year-old woman who had a platinum-resistant yolk sac ovarian tumor. She achieved complete remission on an innovative regimen of docetaxel, gemcitabine, and thalidomide. CONCLUSION: The combination of docetaxel, gemcitabine, and thalidomide might be an active regimen for platinum-resistant ovarian nondysgerminomas and further investigation of this combination is warranted.
