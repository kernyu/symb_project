PURPOSE: To know the treatment outcome of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) during gestation. METHOD: Retrospective study of 3 cases of pregnant women, who were treated for MDR-TB with a regimen including pyrazinamide, ethambutol, para-aminosalicylic acid, cycloserine and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. RESULT: All patients showed a good response to anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy without any serious adverse effect, and were culture-negative at the time of delivery. Two patients delivered vaginally at weeks 40, and one patient delivered surgically at weeks 38. All newborns were healthy, and their tuberculin skin tests and placental tissue examinations were negative for tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: MDR-TB can be successfully treated during pregnancy by using a regimen including effective second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs.
