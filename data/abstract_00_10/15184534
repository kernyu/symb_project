Candida dubliniensis is an emerging pathogen capable of causing oropharyngeal, vaginal and bloodstream infections. Although C. dubliniensis is similar to Candida albicans in several phenotypic characteristics, it differs from it with respect to epidemiology, certain virulence factors and the ability to develop resistance to fluconazole rapidly. In this study, the first seven isolations of C. dubliniensis from Kuwait are described, all originating from non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The isolates were initially identified by the Vitek 2 yeast identification system, positive germ tube test, production of rough colonies and chlamydospores on Staib agar and by their inability to assimilate xylose, trehalose or methyl alpha-D-glucoside. The species identity of the isolates was subsequently confirmed by specific amplification of rDNA targeting the internally transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2), restriction endonuclease digestion of the amplified DNA and direct DNA sequencing of the ITS2. Using the E-test method, the MICs of C. dubliniensis test isolates were in the range 0.125-0.75 microg ml(-1) for fluconazole, 0.002-0.75 microg ml(-1) for itraconazole, 0.006-0.125 microg ml(-1) for ketoconazole, 0.002-0.5 microg ml(-1) for amphotericin B and 0.002-0.016 microg ml(-1) for voriconazole. Two of the isolates were resistant to 5-flucytosine (>32 microg ml(-1)), but none against fluconazole. The study reinforces the current view that C. dubliniensis has a much wider geographical and epidemiological distribution.
