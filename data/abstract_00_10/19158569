PURPOSE: To describe a rare form of fungal keratitis due to Cylindrocarpon lichenicola. METHOD: A 56-year-old woman presented with an atypical corneal ulcer that did not respond to broad- spectrum antibiotics. RESULTS: Additional diagnostic tests such as confocal microscopy and corneal biopsy were useful aids in establishing the diagnosis of fungal keratitis. The ulcer healed completely after the initiation of antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of C. lichenicola keratomycosis in the United Kingdom. Our case demonstrates that prompt recognition and effective treatment of this condition can lead to a good visual outcome.
