Serratia marcescens is an important nosocomial pathogen which is often resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. An imipenem-resistant S. marcescens isolate from a urine specimen was found to carry a bla(VIM-2) gene cassette on a class 1 integron. This finding indicates that bla(VIM-2) is presently spreading even to Serratia spp. in Korea, which could compromise the usefulness of carbapenem in the treatment of multi-resistant Gram-negative bacilli infections. Clinical laboratory should be able to detect the VIM-2-producing isolates with even low carbapenem MIC.
