We undertook a retrospective cohort study describing general outcomes and specific factors associated with positive outcomes in bacteremia due to carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP). Forty-eight patients were included, of which 42% died at 30 days. Forty-two percent of patients were in septic shock at the time of the first positive blood culture, and 42% were recipients of solid organ transplants. Lack of microbiologic eradication at 7 days was independently associated with 30-day mortality. Adjunctive procedures performed for source control and microbiologic eradication at 7 days were associated with a favorable clinical response at 7 days. Time to initiation and receipt at any time of antimicrobials with in vitro activity against CRKP were not associated with improved survival. Breakthrough bacteremia occurred in 8 cases, all in patients receiving tigecycline. Our data suggest that severity of illness, rapid microbiologic eradication, and source control are crucial factors in the outcomes of patients with CRKP bacteremia.
