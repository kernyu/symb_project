Antimicrobial susceptibility of 120 Helicobacter pylori isolates to metronidazole, tetracycline, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin was determined, and 77.5, 15, 10, and 6.6% of the isolates, respectively, were resistant. Only rdxA inactivation and both rdxA and frxA inactivation were responsible for metronidazole resistance in 66% (8 of 12) and 33% (4 of 12) of the isolates, respectively.
