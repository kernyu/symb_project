AIM: To investigate and identify prevalent hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and to explore lamivudine-resistant mutations among treated and untreated patients in Jordan. METHODS: A total of 107 cases with chronic hepatitis B were recruited from different medical centers in Jordan. Serological tests were preformed for all cases using a microparticle enzyme immunoassay. HBV Genotyping was performed for 70 cases using Line probe genotyping assay. The YMDD mutations were explored for 20 cases (4 were lamivudine naive) using the INNO-LiPA HBV DR assay. RESULTS: Genotype D was the only detected genotype. A total of 6 YMDD mutations were detected in 5 treated patients (31%) while one mutation was detected in the naive patients. Seventeen percent of cases were positive for HBeAg and had statistically significant higher levels of serum aminotransferases. CONCLUSION: HBV genotype D appears to be the only circulating type in Jordanian patients. The YMDD mutations were detected in 31% of lamivudine-treated cases with similar patterns to those found in the literature. We also found a relatively low prevalence of HBeAg expression among examined cases (17%). Awareness of these serologic, genotypic and resistance patterns might help in the formulation of management plans and for predicting clinical outcomes. Further larger scale studies are needed to confirm our results and to examine possible associations among clinical, serologic, and genetic patterns of HBV infections in Jordan.
