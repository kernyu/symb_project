This collaborative cross-border study was performed to determine the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial drugs used by the National Programmes for falciparum malaria along the eastern Indo-Nepal border where there is unregulated population movement across the border. The study was conducted at sites in Jhapa District, Nepal and Darjeeling District, India. The study was conducted from August 2003 to February 2004, following the WHO 28 day treatment protocol. The efficacy of chloroquine was tested in India among 91 subjects and of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in Nepal among 107 subjects with laboratory-confirmed Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Of the 102 subjects who completed the study in Nepal, there were 21 (20.6%) treatment failures comprising 7 (6.9%) early treatment failures (ETF) and 14 (14.7%) late treatment failures (LTF) (5 late clinical failures [LCF] and 9 late parasitological failures [LPF]). Of the 89 subjects who completed the study in India, there were 46 (51.7%) treatment failures comprising 7 (7.9%) ETFs and 39 (43.8%) LTFs (13 LCFs and 26 LPFs). Based on WHO guidelines both countries need to review their drug policy urgently and make appropriate changes, taking into account aspects of cross-border collaboration in the control of drug-resistant malaria.
