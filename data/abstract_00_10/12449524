The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a significant difference in high-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) between vancomycin-sensitive enterococci (VSE) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Vancomycin resistance was determined in 116 Enterococcus isolates using brain-heart infusion agar containing 6 micrograms/ml vancomycin. HLAR was determined by both standard agar screening and disk diffusion methods. Streptomycin and gentamicin were used as predictors of HLAR. Vancomycin resistance and HLAR were found in 17 (14.7%) and 41 (35.3%) of the Enterococcus strains, respectively. HLAR was found in 11 of 17 VRE and 30 of 98 VSE strains. HLAR in VRE strains was significantly higher than in VSE. More enterococcal strains were found to be resistant to both gentamicin and streptomycin (29) than to gentamicin (one) or streptomycin (11) alone. The HLAR rate in VRE was two-fold higher than in VSE. The synergistic bactericidal effect of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam or glycopeptide antibiotics is lost if there is high-level resistance to aminoglycosides.
