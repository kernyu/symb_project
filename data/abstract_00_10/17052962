The effects of H-89, a potent and selective inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA) on Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK(Ca)) channels in coronary arterial smooth muscle cells were examined using a patch-clamp technique. In inside-out configuration, H-89 increased the NP(o) of the BK(Ca) channel, but it reduced the dwell time of BK(Ca) currents. In whole-cell configuration, H-89 markedly increased BK(Ca) currents in a concentration-dependent manner. The EC(50) was 0.470+/-0.0741 microM based on dwell time, 0.582+/-0.0691 microM based on the NP(o), and 0.519+/-0.0295 microM based on the whole-cell current, respectively. H-85, which is an inactive form of H-89, increased BK(Ca) currents, similar to the result of H-89. The other PKA inhibitors (Rp-8-CPT-cAMPs and KT 5720) and protein phosphatase inhibitor (okadaic acid, 1 microM) had little effect on BK(Ca) currents and did not significantly alter the stimulatory effects of 1 microM H-89. These findings suggest that H-89 increases the BK(Ca) current independently of PKA.
