Following Ronald Ross' demonstration in 1897 that mosquitoes transmit malarial parasites, efforts to control malaria were naturally focussed on attacking the mosquito vector by various measures, mainly directed against the aquatic stages. Although the results were spectacular in some areas, there was a growing realisation that effective control of malaria depended on other factors, including the availability of better drugs than quinine and a greater understanding of the epidemiology of the disease under various environmental conditions. With the discovery of DDT, an all-out effort was made to eradicate malaria by attacking adult mosquitoes. Eradication was not achieved in many countries, mainly because of inadequate health infrastructures. With the emergence of chloroquine-resistant parasites, the search for more effective drug regimens intensified, various drugs and drug combinations were assessed, and methods were developed to monitor and assess degrees of resistance. Since resistance to drugs can develop very quickly, the use of drug combinations, especially those containing artemisinin derivatives, is now recommended. Insecticide-impregnated bednets have become the preferred method of vector control. Although the search for better tools must continue, the events of the past century emphasise the need to strengthen health systems to ensure that they are capable of delivering effective interventions and of assessing their effectiveness in controlling malaria.
