We report the first case of mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strains harboring multiple mutations including the Q151M multinucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance mutation. Sustained virologic success was obtained in the infant with postnatal antiretroviral therapy optimized according to genotypic drug resistance testing and therapeutic drug monitoring.
