BACKGROUND: We conducted active surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease to assess the serotype and antibiotic resistance patterns in Canada prior to universal infant immunization programs, in most provinces. METHODS: Active surveillance was conducted by the 12 centres of the Canadian Paediatric Society's Immunization Monitoring Program, Active (IMPACT). This report includes children 16 years of age and younger with S. pneumoniae isolated from a normally sterile site, in 1998-2003. RESULTS: During six years of surveillance, 1,868 eligible cases were reported. The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) matched 79% of isolates, including 84% from 6-23 month olds and 80% from 2-5 year olds. The proportion of isolates matched by PCV7 significantly decreased over the surveillance period from 81% in 1998 to 73% in 2003 (p = 0.005). The 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPS) matched 90% of isolates from children 2 years or older. Penicillin non-susceptibility rate was stable at 16% of isolates. Cefotaxime/ceftriaxone resistance rate was 5% and limited to penicillin-resistant isolates. Serotypes found in PCV7 accounted for 89% of penicillin-resistant isolates (100% including cross-reacting types 6A and 19A). CONCLUSION: PCV7 matched three quarters of the isolates from young children as immunization programs began; therefore some program failures are inevitable. Children > or =5 years with predisposing conditions need the broader protection of 23-valent PPS vaccine and special attention from providers to ensure receipt. The rate of penicillin resistance remained steady over the last six years. The majority of isolates non-susceptible to penicillin are found in PCV7.
