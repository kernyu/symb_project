18-amino-4''-O-benzoyl-4'''-N-demethyl-18-deoxospiramycins were designed and synthesized. Synthetic strategy involved selective demethylation of the dimethylamino group in forosamine, benzoylation of the hydroxyl group at the C4'' position and reductive N-amination of the formyl group. Antibacterial characteristics of spiramycin derivatives were tested. The derivatives exhibited promising activity against drug-resistant bacterial strains.
