Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and MSSA strains were treated with: (a) grapefruit oil (GFO) components, isolated by chromatography and characterised by NMR and mass spectroscopy; (b) antimicrobial agents, or (c) a combination of both to evaluate (MIC determination) intrinsic antibacterial activity and to determine whether GFO components could modulate bacterial sensitivity to the anti-bacterial agents. Preliminary data suggested that the grapefruit component 4-[[(E)-5-(3,3-dimethyl-2-oxiranyl)-3-methyl-2-pentenyl]oxy]-7H-furo[3,2-g]chrome n-7-one (2) enhances the susceptibility of test MRSA strains to agents, e.g., ethidium bromide and norfloxacin, to which these micro-organisms are normally resistant.
