Campylobacter species are among the most commonly identified causative agents of acute bacterial gastroenteritis in humans worldwide. In Austria, campylobacteriosis has been a notifiable disease since 1996 and its incidence has increased continuously over the past years. Improvement of notification has led to an important increase in knowledge of the epidemiology of this disease in Austria. In addition to existing programs monitoring food safety, implementation of a national surveillance program to monitor antimicrobial resistance and the prevalence of campylobacter in food animals allows continuous surveillance of trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in humans, animals and food, as well as a more comprehensive evaluation of the occurrence of campylobacter in the relevant reservoirs of human infection. Such data make it possible to identify the most important areas for intervention and launch of control strategies. As in other countries around the world, antimicrobial resistance of campylobacter from human, animal and food origin, particularly resistance to fluoroquinolones, is of public health concern in Austria. The magnitude of global trade and foreign travel requires EU-wide and worldwide implementation of control strategies to fight campylobacteriosis.
