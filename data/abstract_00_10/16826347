A single dose of cefodizime (CDZM), ceftriaxone (CTRX), or spectinomycin (SPCM) is recommended for the treatment of gonococcal urethritis or uterine cervicitis in the era of multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae; namely, cefozopran-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (CZRNG). N. gonorrhoeae pharyngeal infection is not so rare in Japan; however, the proper treatment regimen for this infection is not clear. We previously found that a single dose of CDZM completely eradicated multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae in patients with urethritis and uterine cervicitis, so we tried a single 1.0-g dose of CDZM for the treatment of N. gonorrhoeae pharyngeal infection, including infections with CZRNG. The eradication rate of N. gonorrhoeae from the pharynx was 63.0% with a single 1.0-g dose of CDZM, while the rate for CZRNG with the same dose of CDZM was 38.5%. N. gonorrhoeae was completely eradicated from the pharynx when patients received one or two additional doses of CDZM. Therefore, we concluded that two to three doses of CDZM were necessary for the treatment of N. gonorrhoeae pharyngeal infection including infection with CZRNG.
