Telithromycin (HMR 3647) is a ketolide suitable for the treatment of respiratory infections. The aim of this study was to demonstrate its antibacterial efficacy against an erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, an erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The free serum concentrations of telithromycin, produced by repeated oral administration of 800 mg to adults for 10 days, was simulated in an in vitro system. The ketolide displayed bacteriostatic activity against all three strains tested. This study supported the observation that an 800 mg po dose of telithromycin demonstrated antibacterial efficacy against respiratory tract pathogens.
