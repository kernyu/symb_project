Genes encoding plant antibiotic peptides show expression patterns that are consistent with a defence role. Transgenic over-expression of defence peptide genes is potentially useful to engineer resistance of plants to relevant pathogens. Pathogen mutants that are sensitive to plant peptides in vitro have been obtained and a decrease of their virulence in planta has been observed, which is consistent with their hypothetical defence role. A similar approach has been followed to elucidate the potential direct anti-microbial role of hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, a scavenger of peroxynitrite has been used to investigate its involvement in plant defence.
