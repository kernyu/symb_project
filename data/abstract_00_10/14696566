The FDA approved enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) in spring 2003 to use with other anti-HIV drugs in children age six and older and in adults who have used anti-HIV therapy before. Enfuvirtide is in a new class of drugs called entry inhibitors. The drug works at the start of HIV's reproduction cycle by blocking its ability to infect an immune cell. This occurs at the point when HIV fuses to the cell's outer wall in order to gain entry into it.
