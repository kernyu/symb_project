The des-fluoroquinolone BMS 284756 was active in vitro against all 151 clinical strains of Eikenella corrodens at a MIC of < or = 0.25 microg/ml and was comparable in activity to moxifloxacin and levofloxacin. The MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited by penicillin G was 2 microg/ml; MICs for 8.6% of the strains (13 of 151) were > or = 4 microg/ml, including for two beta-lactamase-producing isolates. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and ampicillin-sulbactam inhibited all strains at a MIC of < or = 1 microg/ml.
