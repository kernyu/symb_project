Heating of a nano-electrospray ionization (nanoESI) source can improve the dissociation efficiency of collisionally induced dissociation (CID) methods, such as nozzle-skimmer CID (NS-CID) and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD), for large biomolecule fragmentation. A metal nanoESI emitter was used due to its resistance to heating above 250 degrees C. This novel method for the dissociation of large biomolecular ions is termed "heat-assisted NS-CID" (HANS-CID) or "heat-assisted IRMPD" (HA-IRMPD). Multiple charged nonreduced protein ions (8.6 Da ubiquitin, 14 kDa lysozyme, and 67 kDa bovine serum albumin) were directly dissociated by HANS-CID and HA-IRMPD to effectively yield fragment ions that could be assigned. The fragment ions of ubiquitin by HANS-CID can be analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using sustained off-resonance irradiation CID (SORI-CID) and IRMPD. In addition, a native large protein, immunoglobulin G (IgG, 150 kDa), was efficiently dissociated by HA-IRMPD. The product ions that were obtained reflected the domain structure of IgG. However, these product ions of IgG and lysozyme were not dissociated by MS/MS using the same heating energetic methods such as IRMPD and SORI-CID.
