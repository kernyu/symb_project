Four months after receiving an orthotopic liver transplant, a 51-year-old man was admitted for progressive liver failure and severe hepatocellular necrosis thought to be due to tacrolimus. During his hospitalization he experienced bloodstream infections including fungemia due to Trichosporon mucoides and prolonged undulating fever despite antifungal and antibacterial treatment. He underwent removal of the allograft and implantation of another liver. Fever continued postoperatively until therapy with posaconazole was initiated. Initiation of posaconazole led to clinical improvement until the patient's demise from bacteremic vancomycin-resistant enterococcal peritonitis. Trichosporonosis appears to be an emerging fungal infection among immunocompromised individuals (including both hematological and solid organ transplant recipients). T. mucoides is a rare cause of systemic infection. When it occurs, trichosporonosis usually is associated with hematological malignancies and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously reported in a liver transplant recipient. The optimal treatment is not well defined. We report here the first case using posaconazole for treatment of trichosporonosis in a liver transplant recipient caused by T. mucoides.
