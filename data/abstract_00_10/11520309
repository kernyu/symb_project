Twelve renal transplant recipients randomised to receive immunosuppression with either tacrolimus (FK506) or cyclosporin underwent oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) a median of 8 months (range 7-9) after transplantation. Six healthy subjects acted as controls. Compared with the controls, both transplant groups had significantly elevated fasting (p < 0.05 for both groups) and postprandial (p < 0.001 for tacrolimus and p < 0.05 for cyclosporin) blood glucose concentrations. Fasting hyperinsulinaemia was observed in both transplant groups (p < 0.05) relative to the control subjects. Glucose-stimulated plasma immunoreactive insulin concentrations in the tacrolimus-treatment group were significantly higher than in the cyclosporin group (p < 0.05) and the controls (p < 0.001). Postprandial blood alanine concentrations were also significantly elevated in the tacrolimus group compared with both the controls (p < 0.001) and cyclosporin-treated patients (p < 0.001). The raised insulin concentrations with normal or increased blood glucose concentrations after renal transplantation suggests that insulin resistance was more marked in patients receiving tacrolimus-based immunosuppression.
