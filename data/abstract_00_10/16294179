INTRODUCTION: Staphylococcus aureus (SA) has acquired a leading role in nosocomial pneumonia in terms of both frequency and severity, and poses therapeutic problems, namely antibiotic resistance and difficulties in the management of anti-staphylococcal drugs. STATE OF THE ART: Epidemiological data confirm that SA is implicated in almost a quarter nosocomial pneumonias, of which about a half are due to methicillin resistant SA (MRSA) in France. The pathophysiology of these infections most often involves inhalation following oropharyngeal carriage. In addition to the risk factors common to all nosocomial pneumonias there are the particular roles of head injury and coma, leading to an increased frequency of SA infection in neuro-surgical patients. PERSPECTIVES: The non-specific clinical picture, the grave prognosis of these pneumonias and the ineffectiveness against MRSA of the antibiotics used in the treatment of Gram negative infections make empirical treatment difficult. CONCLUSION: In addition to the antibiotics classically active against SA (notably methicillin for sensitive strains and glycopeptides for MRSA) new agents may allow improvement in the treatment of these patients, even if their place is not yet definitively established.
