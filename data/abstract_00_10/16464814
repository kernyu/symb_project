OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of an educationally oriented intervention programme, with the recommendations from the National Board of Health and Welfare as a base. DESIGN: A prospective intervention study. SETTING: Six day-care centres in Vaxjo, Sweden. Three centres comprised the intervention group and three constituted the control group. SUBJECTS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The parents and personnel completed a questionnaire on their views concerning information about infectious diseases. During a nine-month period, parents of all children reported every episode of absence, the number of days absent, the cause of absence, and any contact with doctors or prescription of antibiotics. RESULTS: The guidelines were implementable in routine child day-care. Parents found regular information valuable and felt better informed about infectious diseases. Multilevel analyses showed no statistically significant results of the intervention. "Infection-prone" children had more sickness absence, doctor's consultations, and antibiotic prescriptions than those not "infection-prone". CONCLUSION: It is possible to implement an educationally oriented intervention programme directed against infectious diseases in child day-care. No significant effect of the intervention was found, which is why a larger intervention study is needed.
