Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 3,627 isolates of Escherichia coli and 180 isolates of Shigella spp. collected in rural locations from 875 Egyptian children with diarrhoea between 1995 and 2000. The cumulative rates of resistance for E. coli and Shigella spp. were high (respectively, 68.2% and 54.8% for ampicillin, 24.2% and 23.5% for ampicillin-sulbactam, 57.2% and 42.5% for trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, and 50.9% and 75.4% for tetracycline). Non-enterotoxigenic E. coli (NETEC) isolates had a consistently higher level of antimicrobial resistance than did enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolates. Trend testing showed significant decreases in resistance to ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam and tetracycline among all E. coli isolates. Increasing rates of resistance were observed for trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole in ETEC isolates and Shigella spp., but not in NETEC isolates. Low levels of resistance were observed for all other antimicrobial agents tested. Overall, high levels, but decreasing trends, of resistance to commonly used antimicrobial agents were detected among isolates of E. coli and Shigella spp. from children in rural Egypt.
