Currently available options for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection include standard and pegylated interferon alfa and four oral antiviral agents (lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, and telbivudine). These treatment strategies are either therapies of finite duration that aim to achieve sustained off-therapy responses, or long-term treatments that aim to maintain on-therapy remission. Pegylated interferon alfa may offer higher sustained off-therapy responses after 1 year, but most patients do not respond. Oral antivirals are the only candidates for long-term treatment of patients with chronic HBV infection. Viral suppression has favourable effects on patients' outcome and modifies the natural history of the disease. Viral resistance is the main drawback of long-term antiviral therapy. Lamivudine monotherapy is associated with higher resistance (year 1, 10-27%; year 2, 37-48%; year 4, 60-65%) than adefovir (year 1, 0%; year 2, 3%; year 5, 29%) or telbivudine (year 1, 3-4%; year 2, 9-22%). Entecavir resistance is rare in naive individuals (year 4, <1%), but increases over time in lamivudine-resistant patients (year 4, 43%). The best strategy for long-term therapy in chronic HBV infection has yet to be established.
