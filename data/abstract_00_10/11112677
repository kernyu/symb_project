We assessed the risk factors for acquisition of fluoroquinolone-resistant, gram-negative organisms in the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized patients. We analyzed stool samples from 204 patients and recovered fluoroquinolone-resistant, gram-negative organisms from 63. Receipt of fluoroquinolone during the month preceding admission was the only risk factor identified, whereas female sex, duration of hospitalization, exposure to indwelling devices, admission from another hospital, and history of infection were risk factors for fecal colonization after day 4.
