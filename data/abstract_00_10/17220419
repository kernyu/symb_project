DQ-113 was compared in vitro to sitafloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin for potential to select mutational resistance in multiresistant staphylococci, pneumococci, and enterococci. Its ability to select less-susceptible mutants varied according to species, being lowest with staphylococci, intermediate with pneumococci, and greatest with enterococci.
