The incidence of gonorrhoea has increased in Sweden and is now three times higher than in the middle of the 1990's. A remarkable increase of ciprofloxacin resistant gonorrhoea has been reported in Stockholm and other parts of Sweden during 2003. Among men attending a clinic for homosexual men in Stockholm the ciprofloxacin resistant cases have increased from a low level to over 50% during the last year. Most of the homosexual men are exposed in Stockholm and one serotype is dominant. Also in the county of Gavleborg there has been an outbreak of ciprofloxacin resistant gonorrhoea among young heterosexual men and women. No resistance to cefixime, ceftriaxone and spectinomycin has been noted and these antibiotics are then a better first choice of treatment in a Swedish context.
