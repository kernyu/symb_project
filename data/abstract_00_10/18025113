Twenty-four of 128 clinical isolates of Mycoplasma hominis and 6 of 276 clinical isolates of Ureaplasma spp. from Bordeaux, France (1999 to 2002), were resistant to tetracycline and harbored the tet(M) gene. For M. hominis, we also found an increase in tetracycline resistance and two tet(M)-positive isolates that were susceptible to tetracyclines.
