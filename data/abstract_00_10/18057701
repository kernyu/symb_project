In vitro antimicrobial activity of telavancin, a rapidly bactericidal lipoglycopeptide, was evaluated against 1500 strains of MRSA recently isolated in Japan. Telavancin had potent activity, with MIC values that ranged from 0.12 microg/ml to 0.5 microg/ml and a MIC90 value of 0.5 microg/ml. The MIC90s of vancomycin and linezolid were 1.0microg/ml and 2 microg/ml, respectively. No vancomycin intermediate resistant or vancomycin-resistant MRSAs were detected in this surveillance study.
