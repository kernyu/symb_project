In this work, a new biosensor was prepared through immobilization of bovine liver catalase in a photoreticulated poly (vinyl alcohol) membrane at the surface of a conductometric transducer. This biosensor was used to study the kinetics of catalase-H(2)0(2) reaction and its inhibition by cyanide. Immobilized catalase exhibited a Michaelis-Menten behaviour at low H(2)0(2) concentrations (<100mM) with apparent constant K(M)(app)=84+/-3mM and maximal initial velocity V(M)(app)=13.4muS min(-1). Inhibition by cyanide was found to be non-competitive and inhibition binding constant K(i) was 13.9+/-0.3muM. The decrease of the biosensor response by increasing cyanide concentration was linear up to 50muM, with a cyanide detection limit of 6muM. In parallel, electrochemical characteristics of the catalase/PVA biomembrane and its interaction with cyanide were studied by cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. Addition of the biomembrane onto the gold electrodes induced a significant increase of the interfacial polarization resistance R(P). On the contrary, cyanide binding resulted in a decrease of Rp proportional to KCN concentration in the 4 to 50muM range. Inhibition coefficient I(50) calculated by this powerful label-free and substrate-free technique (24.3muM) was in good agreement with that determined from the substrate-dependent conductometric biosensor (24.9muM).
