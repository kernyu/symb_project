Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are frequent causes of bacterial gastroeneritis in humans worldwide. Campylobacteriois is usually a self-limiting disease and therapy with antibiotics is required in severe clinical infections. The objective [corrected] of this study was to determine the antibiotic resistance of C. jejuni and C. coli isolated from humans with diarrhea during 2005-2006 in Bielsko-Biala region in Poland. The MICs of ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, erythromycin, gentamicin and ampicillin were determined by the E-test method. It was observed that 23 % and 6% C. jejuni isolates were resistant to two and three antibiotics, respectively. All isolates of Campylobacter sp. were sensitive to erythromycin and gentamicin. From the 69 C. jejuni strains 58% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 23% to tetracycline and 17% to ampicillin. From the 8 C. coli strains all were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 62,5% to ampicillin and 12,5% to tetracycline.
