The standard treatment recommended for eradication of Helicobacter pylori is a combination of three drugs for seven days: one proton pump inhibitor at a double dose and two antibiotics. The high risk of failure - on the order of 30% - justifies routine testing to verify eradication after this first treatment. Verification is most often conducted with a urea breath test, more rarely by endoscopy when endoscopy or gastric histology is otherwise necessary. When eradication fails, longer multidrug treatment with different antibiotics is proposed. The failure rate after second-line treatment is 9-10%. If a third treatment is necessary, bacterial culture is recommended to select antibiotics on the basis of the antibiotic susceptibility testing.
