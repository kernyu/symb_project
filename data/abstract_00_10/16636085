OBJECTIVES: Acinetobacter baumannii has successfully developed resistance against all common antibiotics, including colistin, one of the last active drugs against this pathogen. We have tested whether the differences in lethal mechanism between polymyxin B and the cecropin A-melittin hybrid peptide CA(1-8)M(1-18), shown previously with a colistin-susceptible strain, can be exploited as a new chemotherapeutic alternative against colistin-resistant clinical isolates. Furthermore, the effect of capsule on the bactericidal activity of cecropin A-melittin analogues (CAMs) was tested. METHODS: MICs and MBCs of the four CAMs were determined for 13 clinical isolates. The bactericidal activity of the antimicrobial peptides was measured using time-kill curves. The presence or absence of capsule was determined using Indian ink stain. RESULTS: The MIC ranges of CA(1-8)M(1-18) and three of its shortened analogues, namely CA(1-7)M(2-9), its Nalpha-terminal octanoylated analogue and CA(1-7)M(5-9), for A. baumannii strains were 2-8, 2-4, 2-8 and 4-4 mg/L, respectively. MBCs differed by a factor of two at the most. All of the cecropin A-melittin peptides showed bactericidal activity in time-kill curves against four A. baumannii strains. The bactericidal activity of CAMs was not affected by the presence of capsule. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that this class of peptides has a fast microbicidal effect on the colistin-resistant A. baumannii isolates, regardless of considerable structural variation among the four peptides and varying colistin MIC for the strains included in the study. Overall, the cecropin A-melittin peptides appear to be a promising alternative to overcome polymyxin resistance in A. baumannii.
