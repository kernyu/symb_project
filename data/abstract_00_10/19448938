Analyses on 1,576 clinical specimens from hospitalized patients were performed with the aim of determining the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp isolated in the Januario Cicco Teaching Maternity Hospital in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, in 2002 and 2003. The samples were collected, processed and identified according to standard procedures, for each clinical specimen. In vitro susceptibility profiles were obtained using the Kirby-Bauer method. 188 strains of Staphylococcus spp were isolated: 105 were identified as Staphylococcus aureus and 83 as coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated most often in secretions, whereas coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was most prevalent in blood cultures. The high (41.5%) prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp shows the need for immediate prophylactic measures aimed at impeding the dissemination of this phenomenon.
