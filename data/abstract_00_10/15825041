From January 2000 through September 2004, a total of 54 patients with infection due to group C nontyphoid salmonellae were evaluated; 8 patients had gastroenteritis alone, and 46 patients had bacteremia. Of the 46 patients who had bacteremia, 12 had endovascular infection and 34 did not. The number of infections due to ciprofloxacin-resistant Salmonella organisms is increasing. Ciprofloxacin-resistant Salmonella organisms predisposed patients to acquire bacteremia, but they did not seem to predispose patients to acquire endovascular infection.
