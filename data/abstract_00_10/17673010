OBJECTIVE: To analyse the trend of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Macao from 2001 to 2005. METHODS: Susceptibility tests of anti-tuberculosis drugs (SM, INH, RFP and EMB) against all M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates were performed in new cases and previous treated cases. RESULTS: The total resistant rate of 1460 isolates was 16.2%; the initial drug resistant rate was 15% and the acquired drug resistant rate was 32%. The multi-drug resistant (MDR) rate was 3.2%, in which the initial and the acquired MDR rates were 2.3% and 15.5%, respectively. Any resistance to INH, SM, RFP and EMB was 11.5%, 9.5%, 3.6% and 2.5% respectively. The resistant rates to 1, 2, 3 and 4 drugs were 9.9%, 2.9%, 1.0% and 1.2% in new cases and 12.6%, 3.9%, 8.7% and 6.8% in previous treated cases. There was no significant increase in drug resistance of new cases and treated cases in last 5 recent years (chi(2) = 0.27, chi(2) = 0.03, all P > 0.05). The initial drug resistant rate did not show significant difference (chi(2) = 5.7, P > 0.05) among different sex and age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the previous data, the acquired drug resistant rate and the acquired MDR rate were significantly lower (chi(2) = 6.04, chi(2) = 7.47, all P < 0.05). But the initial drug resistant rate and acquired drug resistant rate were still higher than the report of No.3 of WHO/IUATLD global project on anti-tuberculosis drug resistance surveillance in 2004. More attention should be paid to the high incidence of MDR tuberculosis.
