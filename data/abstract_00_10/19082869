A total of 54 lambs, aged between 6-8 months were experimentally infected with Haemonchus contortus to evaluate the efficacy of different anthelmintic brands sold on Ethiopian markets using the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) and controlled anthelmintic efficacy trial. Accordingly four different albendazole (Alzole, Analgon-300, Albenjung_s and Ahshialben-300), two tetramisole (Tetsole and Ashitetra 600) and two tetramisole-oxyclozanide (Tetraclozan sheep and Tetraclozash 900) brands were evaluated at the dosage rates recommended by the manufacturers. Animals were allocated into nine groups of six animals each, and balanced for faecal egg counts (FEC), based on their pre-treatment FEC and treatments were randomized among the groups. One group was kept untreated as a control. Faecal egg count was conducted on day 30 post-infection (day of treatment) and on the 10th day post-treatment. Evaluation of anthelmintics based on FECRT revealed high efficacy (99.55-100% reduction in FEC) for all anthelmintic brands tested against H. contortus. The worm count reduction test using controlled anthelmintic efficacy trial also supported the above finding with 99-100% efficacy of the tested anthelmintics. Therefore, the suspicion on the anthelmintic products as being substandard in quality is not credible, at least, for the brands investigated in this study and it might rather be attributed to under dosing. The need for a good extension system for livestock producers with regard to good anthelmintic usage practices, in light of the inevitable development of anthelminitic resistance, is emphasized. Regular surveillance and laboratory quality evaluation of the anthelmintic products in Ethiopia is indicated.
