Data from 20 highly drug-experienced HIV-infected patients receiving tenofovir plus didanosine as part of a salvage regimen were analysed. At baseline, all but one patient harboured a virus bearing at least one nucleoside excision mutation (NEM); in 13 cases (65%) three or more NEM were detectable. After a median of 26 weeks of treatment, two patients (10%) selected the 65R mutation. These results support the hypothesis that NEM hinder the selection of this mutation.
