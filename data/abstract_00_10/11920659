The role of elastin in the aortic wall calcification and involved mechanisms were investigated. The major hypothesis of this work is that elastin is one of the major components to regulate calcification of bioprosthetic heart valve (BHV). The relationship between the elastin content and the calcification rate of the aortic wall was established using collagen-elastin matrices (CEM) made of varying ratios of collagen and elastin (90 and 10, 50 and 50, and 20 and 80). Biophysical characterization of CEM was performed by water content measurement and the tensile strength test. The conformational changes of the calcifiable matrix were evaluated as a function of elastin content using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The calcium contents in CEM implanted in the rat subcutaneous model for 7 days were measured using atomic absorption (AA) spectroscopy. As the concentration of elastin in CEM increased from 10 to 80%, the total amount of calcium accumulated in CEM also increased. The calcium level in CEM containing the collagen and an elastin ratio of 20:80 was 20.16 +/- 0.70 microg/mg compared with 1.96 +/- 0.04 microg/mg in CEM containing the collagen and an elastin ratio of 90:10. The calcification rate of CEM pretreated with ethanol increased, as the elastin concentration in the CEM. However, the calcification rate of CEM pretreated with ethanol is significantly lower than that of the untreated control. The permeation rate of ethanol through CEM with the collagen and an elastin ratio of 20:80 (0.37 +/- 0.13 mmol/cm(2)/h) is significantly smaller than that through CEM with 90:10 (0.94 +/- 0.27 mmol/cm(2)/h). These results indicate that elastin has a significant role in tissue calcification and that elastin's resistance to ethanol penetration partially contributes less effectiveness of ethanol on aortic wall calcification.
