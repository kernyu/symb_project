UNLABELLED: TWO PREREQUISITES: In order to avoid the emergence of bacterial resistance, the treatment of nosocomial infections must avoid unnecessary multiplication of antibiotics. Treatment must also be given early for these life-threatening infections. The presence of resistant and/or multiresistant strains is a common cause of antibiotic failure. EPIDEMIOLOGY: The frequency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains involved in nosocomial pneumonia remains relatively moderate. It would appear logical to anticipate the presence of MRSA strains in patients given prior antibiotic therapy. EFFICACY OF LINEZOLIDE: Three clinical trials in patients with nosocomial pneumonia assessed the efficacy of linezolid. All three demonstrated an equivalent efficacy for linezolide and vancomycin. OTHER ADVANTAGES OF LINEZOLID: Besides its efficacy, linezolid has a good tolerance profile, particularly interesting for intensive care patients with multiple organ insufficiency. It can be given orally and can help reduce hospital stay, an important contribution to cost savings.
