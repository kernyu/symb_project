P-glycoprotein accounts for the most intrinsic and acquired cancer multidrug resistance. To inhibit the expression of P-glycoprotein is one of the effective ways to reverse cancer drug resistance. Honokiol, a naturally occurring compound, has been demonstrated to combat cancer through mechanisms including inhibition of angiogenesis and induction of apoptosis. Here, we show that honokiol down-regulated the expression of P-glycoprotein at mRNA and protein levels in MCF-7/ADR, a human breast MDR cancer cell line. The down-regulation of P-glycoprotein was accompanied with a partial recovery of the intracellular drug accumulation, and of the sensitivities toward adriamycin. This study reveals a novel function of honokiol as an anti-cancer agent.
