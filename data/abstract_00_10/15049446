A laboratory model using green pepper disks was developed to investigate the attachment of Salmonella Chester on plant tissue and to evaluate the effectiveness of sanitizer agents in inactivating attached bacteria on fruits. Pepper disks (14 mm in diam, and 3-4 mm in thickness) were immersed in a bacterial suspension containing 1.5 x 107 cfu x mL(-1) of S. Chester for 30 s and subsequently air-dried at room temperature for 10 min. Approximately 30% of the bacteria retained on the disk after immersion were firmly attached and could not be removed by two washes and agitation. A positive correlation was observed between the number of bacteria attached and the concentration of bacteria in the suspension. Population studies and scanning electron microscopic examinations revealed that attachment of S. Chester on pepper disks occurred mainly on the surfaces of injured (cut) tissue but rarely on the unbroken skin. When inoculated disks were treated with 3% to 12% (w/v) of trisodium phosphate (TSP) at pH 12.3 for 5 min, the population of bacteria on the disk was reduced by 10- to 100-fold. A small portion (0.7% to 7.1%) of bacteria attached to the disk were either resistant to or protected from the TSP treatment. When the pH of TSP solution was reduced from 12.3 to 4.5, the effectiveness of TSP in inactivating S. Chester on pepper disks was reduced by 26%. This study shows that surfaces of injured fruit tissue are the principal sites for bacterial attachment, and a small portion of the bacteria attached to the tissue are resistant to the sanitizer treatment. Avoiding mechanical injuries to fresh fruits during and after harvest would reduce the chance of pathogen attachment and contamination on green pepper and fruits of similar nature.
