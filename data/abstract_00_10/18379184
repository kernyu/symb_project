Infections caused by multiple-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) are a clinically significant problem. We reported here the effective use of combination therapy in a patient with infection caused by MDRP according to an interventional treatment strategy suggested by a pharmacist. The patient was a 70-year-old male who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. On day 45 after transplant, MDRP was newly isolated from urine, but the diagnosis at that time was colonization. On day 61, the patient developed a fever (> or =38.0 degrees C). In addition, laboratory data showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) was also increased. At the medical team conference, the pharmacist proposed the following treatment strategy for this infection. Aztreonam and amikacin were intravenously administered at doses of 2 g/day and 800 mg/day, respectively. The subsequent clinical course was well controlled, but the infection recurred and was aggravated. Aztreonam and ciprofloxacin were then intravenously administered at doses of 4 g/day and 600 mg/day, respectively, resulting in the alleviation of fever in the patient as well as a decrease in CRP and disappearance of MDRP isolates from urine on day 67; that is, MDRP infection was consequently well controlled. In conclusion, the combination therapy between aztreonam and amikacin, or ciprofloxacin may be clinically useful for severe infections of MDRP in compromised hosts.
