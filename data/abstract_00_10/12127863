Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that infects the epithelial cells of the small intestine causing diarrheal illness in humans. Cryptosporidium has a worldwide distribution and is considered an emerging zoonosis. Despite intensive efforts to develop workable experimental models, and the evaluation of over 200 chemotherapeutic agents, adequate therapies to clear the host of these parasites are still lacking. The reasons for the lack of drug efficacy are probably manifold and may include the unusual location of the parasite in the host cell, distinct structural and biochemical composition, or its ability to either block import or rapidly efflux drug molecules. Understanding some of the basic mechanisms by which drugs are transported to the parasite and identifying unique targets is a first step in developing effective therapeutic agents.
