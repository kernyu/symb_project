Simocyclinone D8 (SD8) is known to affect Gram-positive bacteria only. By testing SD8 against several clinical isolates, we showed that SD8 resulted very active against Gram-negative bacteria from clinical specimens, while it was shown inactive against laboratory strains. The activity against the former was in part due to enhanced drug entry. In addition, SD8 appears to share chromosome- and plasmid-mediated resistance mechanisms with fluoroquinolones.
