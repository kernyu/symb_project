Streptomyces coelicolor has two genes encoding tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases, one of which (trpRS1) is resistant to and transcriptionally activated by indolmycin. We found that this gene also confers resistance to chuangxinmycin (another antibiotic that inhibits bacterial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases) and that its transcription is not absolutely dependent on either antibiotic.
