Intrinsic resistance to mureidomycin is shown in Escherichia coli. This is in contrast to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which generally displays intrinsic resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents, but not to mureidomycin. Isogenic efflux system mutants from both species were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility tests. These studies showed that the differences regarding the susceptibility of E. coli and P. aeruginosa to mureidomycin A and C may be explained by the expression of efflux systems that mediate resistance to mureidomycin A and C.
