We report a new Salmonella genomic island 1 variant antibiotic resistance gene cluster called SGI1-L in a Salmonella enterica serovar Newport isolate containing a dfrA15 gene cassette conferring resistance to trimethoprim. The isolate carried another class 1 integron containing the aacC5 and aadA7 gene cassettes conferring resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin/spectinomycin, respectively.
