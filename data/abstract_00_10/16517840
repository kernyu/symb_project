The BACTEC MGIT 960 system, a fully automated, nonradiometric, noninvasive system for detection and drug susceptibility testing of mycobacteria, was evaluated for the ability to test susceptibilities to second-line drugs. In this study, which was carried out in three phases (phase I, mostly susceptible strains; phase II, mostly resistant strains; phase III, final testing of the optimal drug concentrations found in phases I and II), we established the critical concentrations for seven drugs to be tested in the BACTEC MGIT 960 system compared to the BACTEC 460TB system. The critical concentrations for the seven drugs used in the MGIT 960 system are as follows: amikacin, 1.0 microg/ml; capreomycin, 2.5 microg/ml; ethionamide, 5.0 microg/ml; protionamide, 2.5 microg/ml; ofloxacin, 2.0 microg/ml; rifabutin, 0.5 microg/ml; linezolid, 1.0 microg/ml. Our results demonstrate that the BACTEC MGIT 960 system is an accurate method for rapid testing of the susceptibilities of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to second-line drugs.
