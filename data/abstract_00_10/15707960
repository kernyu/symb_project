BAG-1 is a multi-functional protein that exists in three major isoforms, BAG-1 p50, p46, and p36. A fourth isoform of 29 kDa also exists but its function remains mostly unknown. To further understand the role of this smaller isoform in ovarian cancer cells, the SKOV3 cell line was transfected with a doxycycline-inducible human BAG-1 p29 isoform or control plasmid. Ovexpression of BAG-1 p29 promotes protection from apoptosis in the presence of EGF as shown by decreased cell death measured by XTT assay and caspase-3 activity. Unexpectedly, however, BAG-1 p29 does not associate with the EGF receptor. When BAG-1 p29 transfectants were incubated in hydrogel-coated plates, BAG-1 p29-expressing SKOV3 cells were significantly more resistant to anoikis as compared to controls, and this correlated with decreased activation of caspase-3. The results of this study implicate BAG-1 p29 in the regulation of both the EGF signaling cascade and the apoptotic cascade induced by loss of anchorage.
