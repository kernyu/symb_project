Dermcidin (DCD) is an antimicrobial peptide constitutively expressed in eccrine sweat glands in human skin. By post-secretory proteolytic processing in sweat, the DCD protein gives rise to anionic and cationic DCD peptides that are able to kill several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria but are only weakly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we questioned whether bacterial resistance to DCD peptides is mediated by proteolytic degradation. It was shown that DCD-derived peptides are degraded by purified bacterial proteases and by extracellular proteases secreted by P. aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent manner. However, protease-deficient mutants of P. aeruginosa PAO1 lacking either lasA, lasB (elastase) or both showed a similar sensitivity towards DCD-derived peptides as the wild-type strain. Finally, inhibition of total protease activity indicated that proteases secreted by P. aeruginosa are not responsible for the poor activity of DCD-derived peptides against P. aeruginosa. These data suggest that the decreased sensitivity of P. aeruginosa to DCD-derived peptides is not mediated by proteolytic degradation under physiological conditions.
