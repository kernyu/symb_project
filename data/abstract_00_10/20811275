INTRODUCTION: Despite recent success after the introduction of combination therapy with interferon (IFN)-alpha and ribavirin, approximately 60% of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 fail to respond. Resistance to antiviral therapy remains a serious problem in the management of chronic hepatitis C. In most patients, HCV RNA could be detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC). OBJECTIVE: The authors aimed to investigate the predictive value of HCV RNA in PBMC of patients with chronic hepatitis C after IFN treatment, which may act as the source of HCV reinfection of hepatic cells. METHODS: Seventy patients with chronic hepatitis C were treated with IFN plus ribavirin for 48 weeks; they all achieved clearance of HCV RNA from serum. At the end of treatment, PBMC and serum were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction for detection of HCV RNA. Six months later, HCV RNA in serum was monitored to detect sustained virologic response. RESULTS: : Analysis revealed the presence of detectable HCV RNA in the PBMC of 27% of patients despite clearance of serum HCV RNA. During follow-up, 80% of the patients who became serum HCV positive 6 months after the end of treatment had detectable level of HCV RNA in PBMC at the end of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of HCV in the serum of patients by the end of treatment does not exclude future viremia. The patient might still be a source of infection to others. It is strongly encouraged to test for HCV in PBMC to detect lack of response to treatment and persisting infection.
