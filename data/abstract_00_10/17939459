The National Resistance Monitoring of the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) is to determine the prevalence of resistance of bacterial pathogens from animals using a valid database. From 2004 to 2006, a total of 1,472 Pasteurella multocida strains isolated from pigs with acute respiratory tract diseases was submitted to the BVL and examined. Of these, 1,11 (75.5 %) were included in the study and tested using 24 different antimicrobial substances. The results showed that the resistance level is generally low, with the exception of the substances tetracycline, trimethoprim, and the combination trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. It also became clear that resistance data need to be evaluated separately for each of the animal production categories, so that a realistic figure of the current resistance level can be presented. This knowledge provides information about the resistance situation in Germany, and helps deduce the necessary management measures that must be taken to minimize resistance to antibiotics. Furthermore, it provides valuable information that can form the basis for empirical therapy, so that the National Resistance Monitoring makes an important contribution to the safety of food derived from animals and consequently aids the improvement of consumer protection.
