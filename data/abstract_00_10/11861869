Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) heterogeneity contributes to the emergence of drug-resistant virus, escape from host defense systems, and/or conversion of the cellular tropism. To establish an in vitro system to address a heterogeneous virus population, we constructed a library of HIV-1 molecular clones containing a set of random combinations of zero to 11 amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to protease inhibitors by the HIV-1 protease. The complexity (2.1 x 10(5)) of the HIV-1 library pNG-PRL was large enough to cover all of the possible combinations of zero to 11 amino acid substitutions (a total of 4,096 substitutions possible). The T-cell line MT-2 was infected with the HIV-1 library, and resistant viruses were selected after treatment by the protease inhibitor ritonavir (0.03 to 0.30 microM). The viruses that contained three to eight amino acid substitutions could be selected within 2 weeks. These results demonstrate that this HIV-1 library could serve as an alternative in vitro system to analyze the emergence of drug resistance and to evaluate the antiviral activity of novel compounds against multidrug-resistant viruses.
