OBJECTIVES: Between November 2001-January 2002 we collected 406 samples from patients hospitalized in Intensive Care adults and new-borns Unit (ICU). The aim was to observe the colonization and infection status with bacteria that may have nosocomial potential and to establish circulating phenotypes in ICUs. METHODS: The identification was performed by API (bioMerieux) method, and we have performed the antimicrobial susceptibility tests by both: API method and by Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion test. RESULTS: We isolated 295 strains with nosocomial potential: 34 MRSA strains, 23 MRCNS strains, 29 ESBL producing gram negative rods, etc. CONCLUSIONS: We observed the presence of multiple drug resistant bacteria which play an important roll in both: massive colonization of patients and in the etiology of nosocomial infections. This leads us to the conclusion that antibiotic resistance pattern should be interpreted by the bacteriologist and a consistent policy concerning the use of antimicrobial drugs in hospital settings should be instituted.
