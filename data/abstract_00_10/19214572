Giardia intestinalis can develop resistance to albendazole, although the molecular mechanism is not understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences and permanent mutation in the beta-giardin gene of G. intestinalis strains: sensitive, resistant, or recovered-resistance to albendazole. The beta-giardin gene was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction. The IC(50) values varied from 0.29 to 0.38 microg/mL for strains sensitive to albendazole. For resistant strains, the IC(50) range was 1.31-2.12 microg/mL. Recovered-sensitivity albendazole strains' IC(50) values were 0.33-0.49 microg/mL, and for strains with recovered-resistance, the IC(50) was 1.42-2.74 microg/mL. beta-giardin amplicon (720 bp) was sequenced and analysis sequence revealed several amino acid mutations from resistant and recovered-sensitive strains of G. intestinalis. Most of the mutations were located in the ROD domain of beta-giardin with a change from the sequence "TIARERA" in sensitive strains instead "IDRPRE" in resistant strains. A comparative sequence analysis in resistant, recovered-sensitive, and resistant-recovered strains revealed permanent mutation. This is the first report of combinatorial serine-proline-arginine repeats in the ROD domain of beta-giardin, whereas such repeats have been reported previously in the HEAD domain of SF-assemblin proteins. This is the first time that the resistance to albendazole correlates with genetics but it is not necessarily caused by mutations in the beta-giardin gene of G. intestinalis.
