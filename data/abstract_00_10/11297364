Spontaneous streptomycin-resistant mutants were isolated from two fast growing gum-producing strains Ca85 and Ca401 and from two moderately growing strains Ca181 and Ca534 of Rhizobium sp. Cicer. The nodulation ability and symbiotic effectiveness of the mutants relative to parent strains were evaluated on chickpea (Cicer arietinum) grown in sterilized chillum jars. Some mutants of strains Ca85 and Ca401 showed Nod phenotype whereas some mutants of strains Ca181 and Ca534 showed Nod(+) fix(-) phenotype. Other mutants also showed decreased nodule number and reduction in nitrogenase activity as well as in shoot dry weight as compared to inoculation with parental strains. The results showed that acquisition of streptomycin resistance in Rhizobium sp. Cicer strains is associated with decreased symbiotic effectiveness in chickpea, suggesting that antibiotic-resistant mutants first should be analyzed for symbiotic effectiveness before using these mutants for ecological studies or nodulation competitiveness.
