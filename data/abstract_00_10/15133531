To investigate the effect of the ciprofloxacin on the urinary excretion of the rifampicin in humans, ciprofloxacin and rifampicin were coadministered. Five healthy volunteers between the ages of 20 and 35 years received, on 2 separate occasions (phases 1 and 2) and at weekly intervals, 600 mg rifampicin and 600 mg plus 500 mg ciprofloxacin, respectively, with 350 mL of water. Urinary levels of rifampicin were measured from 1-72 hours later. In phase 1, 15.6% urinary rifampicin was recovered compared with 15.5% urinary rifampicin recovered in the second phase. An increased excretion rate and higher plateau were obtained in ciprofloxacin plus rifampicin treatment. The study indicates that rifampicin may be coadministered with ciprofloxacin to check the development of drug resistance to single-drug therapy by susceptible organisms.
