Although aspergillosis remains the most common mould infection in patients with haematologic malignancies, disseminated Fusarium infection is an emerging problem with a poor prognosis in this patient population. The treatment options are limited due to relative resistance of the fungus to standard antifungals. We present a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia successfully treated with AmBisome for a disseminated Fusarium solani infection that did not respond to first line treatment with voriconazole. Despite the fact that he received additional myelosuppressive chemotherapy and underwent two stem cell transplantations from HLA mismatched donors the Fusarium infection did not recur during the subsequent phases of neutropenia. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic options of fusariosis in immunocompromised patients are briefly discussed.
