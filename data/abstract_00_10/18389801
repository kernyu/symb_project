UNLABELLED: Ertapenem is a new carbapenem with an excellent activity against different Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Its good antibacterial activity is closely related to high hydrolysis resistance by bacterial beta-lactamases. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We evaluated antimicrobial activity of ertapenem by comparison that of methicillin, gatifloxacin, cefepime and linezolid against 455 staphylococci collected during 2006-2007 period from healthy individuals. RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution technique. Ertapenem has an activity comparable to the other tested agents. Resistance rate was 1% for all investigated strains.
