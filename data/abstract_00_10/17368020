In the past few years, a significant effort has been devoted by Pharmacia toward the discovery of novel antibiotics. We have recently described the identification of an anthranilic acid lead 1 and the optimization resulting in the advanced lead 2. In this report, we describe the preparation of several selected amide bioisosteres connecting the A- and the B-rings. The E-alkene provided a rigid analog with equal potency to the corresponding amide. This indicates that the amide is not a recognition element rather acts as an appropriate spatial linker of the two important aryl A and B rings. The work here clearly demonstrates that the amide linker can be replaced with several functionalities without significant deterioration in the MIC activity.
