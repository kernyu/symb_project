Between 1998 and 2001, the Peruvian Ministry of Health made sweeping changes in its malaria treatment policies in response to a resurgence of disease and the spread and intensification of antimalarial drug resistance. On the Pacific Coast, the first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria was changed to combination therapy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate; in the Amazon region, mefloquine-artesunate combination therapy was introduced. With these changes in treatment policy, Peru became the first country in the Americas to use combination therapy with an artemisinin drug as its first-line treatment for falciparum malaria and the first country in the world to use two different drug combination therapy regimens based on an artemisinin drug in different regions of the country. This paper describes the process involved in assessing the geographic distribution and intensity of antimalarial drug resistance throughout the country and the use of that information to guide decisions related to national malaria treatment policy.
