OBJECTIVES: The complete nucleotide sequence of the 12 656 bp plasmid pFPTB1 from Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, which mediates resistance to tetracyclines and ampicillin, was determined. The plasmid was analysed for potential reading frames and structural features indicative of transposons and transposon relics. METHODS: Plasmid pFPTB1 was transformed into Escherichia coli JM109, overlapping restriction fragments were cloned into E. coli plasmid vectors and sequenced. In vitro susceptibility testing was carried out to confirm the resistance phenotype mediated by this plasmid. RESULTS: Plasmid pFPTB1 contains a complete Tn3-like transposon of 4950 bp consisting of the left terminal repeat, Tn3-related tnpR and tnpA genes for transposition functions, a novel gene for ampicillin resistance bla(TEM-135), and the right terminal repeat. Immediately downstream, the terminal 5215 bp at the right end of a Tn1721-like transposon, including the right terminal repeat, a truncated transposase gene, as well as the genes tet(A) and tetR for tetracycline resistance, were detected. A 5 bp direct repeat, TAAAA, was seen immediately upstream of the Tn3 part and immediately downstream of the Tn1721 part. Plasmid pFPTB1 also carries a replication region similar to that of the Klebsiella pneumoniae plasmid pJHCMW1. CONCLUSION: Plasmid pFPTB1 is one of the few completely sequenced plasmids from S. Typhimurium and harbours a novel transposon-like structure consisting of a Tn3-related part containing the bla(TEM-135) gene for ampicillin resistance and a Tn1721-related part containing the tetR-tet(A) genes for tetracycline resistance.
