Information on pneumococcal disease, including immunisation programs, and optimum future surveillance in each Australian State and Territory were discussed at the Pneumococcal Disease in Australia Workshop on 26-27 March 1999. Workshop participants further expanded on the surveillance aspects of the Workshop in this report. Most participants favoured notification by laboratories of pneumococcal isolates from sterile sites, to provide baseline surveillance data before immunisation programs are fully implemented. It was also thought that trends in antimicrobial resistance should be notified.
