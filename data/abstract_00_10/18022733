Synthesis and anti-staphylococcal activity of a number of substituted 2-anilinobenzimidazoles, benzothiazoles and benzoxazoles are reported. The anti-staphylococcal activities were evaluated in standard in vitro MIC assay method. While anilinobenzimidazole derivatives 11-45 showed very potent anti-staphylococcal activities (greatest activity with an MIC value of 0.095 microg/mL), none of the 2-anilinobenzothiazoles and benzoxazole derivatives exhibited inhibitory activity. QSAR analysis of the anilinobenzimidazoles was studied on the relationship between the anti-staphylococcal activity (MIC in mug/ml) and extrapolated log k(w) values.
