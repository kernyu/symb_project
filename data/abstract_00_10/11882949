Elicitors of plant defence reactions, oligogalacturonides and cryptogein, an elicitin produced by Phytophthora cryptogea, were previously shown to induce a rapid and transient activation of two mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in cells of tobacco [ Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Xanthi; A. Lebrun-Garcia et al. (1998) Plant J 15:773-781]. We verified that these two MAPKs correspond to the salicylic acid-induced protein kinase (SIPK) and the wound-induced protein kinase (WIPK). The involvement of salicylic acid (SA) in cryptogein-induced MAPK activation was investigated using transgenic NahG tobacco cells expressing the salicylate hydroxylase gene and thus unable to accumulate SA. The large and sustained activation of both MAPKs by cryptogein was maintained in transgenic cells compared with non-transgenic tobacco cells. Moreover, weak acids, namely SA, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, an ineffective analogue of SA in plant resistance, and butyric acid acidified the cytosol, a physiological event also induced by cryptogein, but activated both MAPKs only slightly and transiently in tobacco cells. These results indicate that MAPK activation by cryptogein is not mediated by SA, that cytosolic acidification can be transduced by MAPKs, and that in cryptogein-treated cells, cytosolic acidification should contribute poorly to MAPK activation.
