Mutations H358Y, L363F/M, A364V and A366T/V confer in-vitro resistance to bevirimat. Moreover, polymorphisms at the Glutamine-Valine-Threonine (QVT) motif (369-371) have been associated with reduced bevirimat activity in vivo. The rate of these changes was assessed in 389 HIV+ patients naive for bevirimat. QVT polymorphisms were frequent (47%), especially in non-B subtypes (93%). Conversely, only four patients (1%) harbored major bevirimat resistance mutations. Finally, specific gag changes were associated with protease inhibitor resistance mutations in subtype B viruses.
