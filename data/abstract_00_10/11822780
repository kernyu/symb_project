Haemophilus influenzae is a relevant cause of morbidity and mortality among children under 5 years of age in the developing world. In Latin America, H. influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine and surveillance of H. influenzae antimicrobial susceptibility have been implemented in recent years. We have undertaken a systematic review and a pooled analysis on H. influenzae antimicrobial resistance, including reports of 15 Latin America countries over a 10-year period (1990-2000). We have found that 450 (21.4%) of 2,100 invasive isolates were beta-lactamase producers compared to 145 (14.5%) of 998 isolates of noninvasive isolates (p < 0.05). Ampicillin resistance was detected among 783 (21.9%) of 3,577 invasive isolates compared to 111 (17.2%) of 646 noninvasive strains (p < 0.05). In contrast, 568 (41.9%) of 1,355 noninvasive strains were trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) resistance against 241 (26.9%) of 897 invasive ones (p < 0.05). Therefore, TMP-SMX resistance was more common in nonsterile fluids than in sterile fluids. Over time, rates of beta-lactamase-producing strains were stable in Brazil and Mexico, whereas rates of TMP-SMX resistance were increasing in Brazil. It is predictable that following the Hib immunization, Latin America countries will be faced with increased nontypeable H. influenzae infection. Although standing by the nontypeable H. influenzae vaccine, in this novel epidemiological scenario of post-Hib vaccination in Latin America settings there is a need to improve H. influenzae resistance monitoring to guide clinicians to choose efficacious antimicrobial therapy.
