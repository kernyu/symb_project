Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, studies have demonstrated declining morbidity and mortality rates among people with HIV. This is largely because antiretroviral combination therapy can suppress plasma HIV viral load below detectable limits and cause gradual elevation in CD4 cell counts, resulting in improved immune status for responsive patients who are compliant with therapy. These drugs, however, are not without side-effects, both general and oral, and this review draws attention to some of the interactions of the drugs used to treat HIV infection with drugs used in dentistry.
