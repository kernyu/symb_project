Four groups (A, B, C and D) of 10 naive rats were used to compare the virulence of isolates of a strain of Trypanosoma brucei before and after the development of diminazene aceturate resistance. Group A rats were uninfected (controls). Group B rats were infected with a trypanosome isolate unexposed to the drug, while groups C and D rats were infected with two different drug-resistant isolates of the same strain. Rats in the three infected groups each received 10(6) trypanosomes intraperitoneally. Prepatent periods were longer (P<0.05) in groups C and D than in group B. The parasitaemic periods in groups B, C and D were similar, but group C and D rats differed from group B rats in surviving longer, and in showing lower degrees of parasitaemia, anaemia and hepatomegaly. No differences were noted between group C and D rats. Thus, diminazene aceturate resistance appeared to reduce the virulence of T. brucei.
