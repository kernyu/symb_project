Macrophages (MPhis) are a major source of HIV-1 especially in patients with tuberculosis. There are MPhis that are permissive and those that restrict HIV-1. Regulation of hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck) activity and selective expression of CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) isoforms greatly contribute to determine distinct susceptibility of MPhis to HIV-1. Resistance is attributable to reduced expression of Hck and augmented expression of an inhibitory small isoform of C/EBPbeta. Derivatives of erythromycin A (EMA) EM201 and EM703 inhibit the replication of HIV-1 in tissue MPhis, at posttranscriptional and translational levels. We demonstrate that EM201 and EM703 convert tissue MPhis from HIV-1 susceptible to HIV-1 resistant through down-regulation of Hck and induction of small isoforms of C/EBPbeta. These drugs inhibit p38MAPK activation which is expressed only in susceptible tissue MPhis. Activated CD4(+)T cells stimulate the viral replication in HIV-1 resistant MPhis through down-regulation of small isoforms of C/EBPbeta via activation of ERK1/2. EM201 and EM703 can inhibit the MAPK activation and inhibit the burst of viral replication produced when CD4(+)T cells and MPhis interact. These EM derivatives may be highly beneficial for repression of residual HIV-1 in the lymphoreticular system of HIV-1-infected patients and offer great promise for the creation of new anti-HIV drugs for the future treatment of AIDS patients.
