To determine whether flow sorting increased the susceptibility of spermatozoa to reactive oxygen species (ROS), ram semen was either diluted with Tris medium (100 x 10(6) spermatozoa mL(-1); D) or highly diluted (10(6) spermatozoa mL(-1)) before being centrifuged (DC) at 750g for 7.5 min at 21 degrees C or flow-sorted (S) before cryopreservation. Thawed spermatozoa were resuspended in graded concentrations of hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative stress. In Experiment 1, following exposure to 30 or 45 muM hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), the total motility (%) of DC (41.0 +/- 7.3 or 25.7 +/- 6.7, respectively) and S spermatozoa (33.8 +/- 6.3 or 20.1 +/- 6.3, respectively) was lower (P < 0.001) than that of D spermatozoa (58.7 +/- 5.6 or 44.5 +/- 6.7, respectively). In Experiment 2, supplementation of samples containing H(2)O(2) with catalase (150 IU mL(-1)) or seminal plasma proteins (4 mg protein per 10(8) spermatozoa) negated oxidative stress, resulting in comparable values to samples receiving no H(2)O(2)in terms of the proportion of spermatozoa with stable plasmalemma (as determined using merocyanine-540 and Yo-Pro-1) in the D and S groups, the proportion of viable, acrosome-intact spermatozoa (as determined by fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide staining) in the D group and the motility of control (undiluted) and S spermatozoa. Neither H(2)O(2) nor sperm type (i.e. D, DC or S) had any effect on intracellular concentrations of ROS. These results show that flow sorting increases the susceptibility of spermatozoa to ROS, but the inclusion of anti-oxidants or seminal plasma as part of the sorting protocol improves resistance to oxidative stress.
