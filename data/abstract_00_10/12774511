The problem of disease agents resistance to antibiotics is a general-microbiological one, but it was considered in literature with respect to bacteria only. The problem of resistance to antibiotics of mollicutes class representatives has not been touched in generalizing literature. This work is the first attempt to analyze the data from the world literature concerning the appearance of resistance to antibiotics in mollicute species, doing the greatest harm to people, and to present information which would be of consultative value, when choosing antibiotics to treat human mycoplasmoses.
