The RNA replication machinery of HCV is a multi-subunit membrane-associated complex. NS5A has emerged as an active component of HCV replicase, possibly involved in regulation of viral replication and resistance to the antiviral effect of interferon. We report here substituted piperazinyl-N-(aryl)benzamides as potent inhibitors of HCV replication exerted via modulation of the dimerization of NS5A.
