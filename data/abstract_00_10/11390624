Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major cause of liver disease worldwide, is frequently resistant to the antiviral alpha interferon (IFN). We have recently found that the HCV NS5A protein induces expression of the proinflammatory chemokine IL-8 to partially inhibit the antiviral actions of IFN in vitro. To extend these observations, in the present study we examined the relationship between levels of IL-8 in serum, HCV infection, and biochemical response to IFN therapy. Levels of IL-8 were significantly elevated in 132 HCV-infected patients compared to levels in 32 normal healthy subjects and were also significantly higher in patients who did not respond to IFN therapy than in patients who did respond to therapy. This study suggests that HCV-induced changes in levels of chemokine and cytokine expression may be involved in HCV antiviral resistance, persistence, and pathogenesis.
