Studies have shown that after Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) corneal infection, BALB/c mice that are capable of resolving the disease, locally produce IFN-gamma. As T cells are not detected in the infected cornea of these mice, antibody depletion was used to test whether NK cells produce the cytokine. After depletion, decreased corneal IFN-gamma mRNA and increased disease severity, bacterial load, and PMN infiltrate resulted. Further work determined if substance P (SP), a pro-inflammatory neuropeptide, participated in regulation of this response. To this end, mice were treated with the SP antagonist, spantide I that blocks SP interaction with neurokinin-1, its major receptor. The treatment significantly decreased corneal IFN-gamma and IL-18 protein levels and corneal perforation resulted. In vitro experiments using isolated splenic NK cells confirmed their ability to respond to IL-18 and SP and to secrete IFN-gamma protein. We conclude: that for development of the BALB/c resistance response, NK cells are required to produce IFN-gamma; that the cells express the neurokinin-1 receptor; and that SP directly regulates IFN-gamma production through this receptor. The data suggest a unique link between the nervous system and development of innate immunity in the cornea.
