The in vitro activity of retapamulin was determined and compared to that of topical and community antibiotics. The MIC(90)s of retapamulin against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were 0.12 microg/ml and 0.016 microg/ml, respectively. Retapamulin has a low propensity to select resistance and produces an in vitro postantibiotic effect.
