The streptogramin antibiotics were discovered over 40 years ago but are only now emerging as important therapeutic agents for the treatment of infection caused by a variety of bacteria. The streptogramins consist of mixtures of two structurally distinct compounds, type A and type B, which are separately bacteriostatic, but bactericidal in appropriate ratios. These antibiotics act at the level of inhibition of translation through binding to the bacterial ribosome. Resistance to streptogramins occurs through a number of mechanisms including target modification, efflux, and enzyme catalyzed antibiotic modification. This review describes the current understanding of streptogramin function and resistance with emphasis on molecular mechanism and epidemiology.
