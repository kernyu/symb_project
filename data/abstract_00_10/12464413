We describe a strategy for the mutagenesis of the free-living adult generation of Strongyloides ratti and selection of worms carrying new mutations in the subsequent F2 generation of infective larvae. We demonstrate that this strategy is successful via the selection of infective larvae that are resistant to the anthelmintic ivermectin at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. The majority of these larvae were unable to give rise to patent infections when used to infect parasite naive rats, implying that the majority of the ivermectin resistance mutations confer pleiotropic defects on parasitic, but not on free-living, development.
