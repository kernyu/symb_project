A range of European habitats was screened by PCR for detection of the oxytetracycline resistance genes otr(A) and otr(B), found in the oxytetracycline-producing strain Streptomyces rimosus. Primers were developed to detect these otr genes in tetracycline-resistant (Tc(R)) streptomycete isolates from environmental samples. Samples were obtained from bulk and rhizosphere soil, manure, activated sludge and seawater. The majority of Tc(R) streptomycetes originated from bulk and rhizosphere soil. Fewer Tc(R) streptomycetes were isolated from manure and seawater and none from sewage. By PCR, three out of 217 isolates were shown to contain the otr(A) gene and 13 out of 217 the otr(B) gene. Surprisingly, these genes were detected in taxonomic groups not known as tetracycline-producing strains. The majority of the otr gene-carrying strains was assigned to S. exfoliatus or S. rochei and originated from all habitats from which Tc(R) streptomycetes were obtained. Our results indicated that the occurrence of otr(A) and otr(B) genes in natural environments was limited and that otr(B), in comparison to otr(A), seemed to be more common.
