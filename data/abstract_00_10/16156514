Three series of the novel sulfonylurea derivatives of 15-membered azalides, i.e. 9a-N-[N'-(aryl)sulfonylcarbamoyl] (4a-4f, 5a-5f), 9a-N-{N'-[(aryl)sulfonylcarbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl]} (10a-10f, 11a, 11c) and 9a-N-{N'-(beta-cyanoethyl)-N'-[(aryl)sulfonylcarabamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl]} (14a-14f, 15a, 15b, 15f) derivatives of 9-deoxo-9-dihydro-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin A (2) and 5-O-desosaminyl-9-deoxo-9-dihydro-9a-aza-9a-homoerythronolide A (3) were prepared and their structures elucidated by NMR and IR spectroscopic methods and mass spectrometry. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these compounds was determined on a panel of sensitive and resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. Several compounds of the series of 9a-N-[N'-(aryl)sulfonylcarbamoyl] derivatives that showed significant improvements in activity against inducible resistant Streptococcus pyogenes strain were suggested for further optimization.
