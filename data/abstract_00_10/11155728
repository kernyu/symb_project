THE MAINTAVIR STUDY: A switch from a protease inhibitor to a non-nucleosidic inhibitor can simplify the treatment of patients who have reached an undetectable level of viral load while maintaining a good immunological response. The Maintavir study is an open pilot study designed to assess tolerance and viral and immunological response over 18 months. PROMISING RESULTS: Among the 73 patients included in this study, 86% maintained an undetectable viral load while 10 patients (14%) experienced viral rebound. Besides a simpler treatment regimen, tolerance was good and triglyceride levels improved. INTERPRETATION OF THE VIRAL REBOUND: Observed essentially in patients who had previously experienced treatment failures prior to addition of a protease inhibitor, this rebound might correspond to archived resistance against nucleosidic inhibitors within the cells and a re-emergence of a resistant virus.
