The estimated prevalence and antimicrobial resistances of Salmonella spp. in non-diarrhoeic dogs across Trinidad was determined. The serotypes of Salmonella spp. isolated were also identified. Of a total of 1391 dogs sampled, 50 (3.6%) were positive for Salmonella spp. with 28 different serotypes, the predominant serotypes were Javiana (12), Newport (6), Arechavaleta (5) and Heidelberg (5). Fifty-seven (85.1%) of 67 isolates exhibited resistance to one or more antimicrobial agents. Of eight antimicrobial agents tested, resistance was exhibited to streptomycin (80.6%), cephalothin (37.3%), neomycin (38.8%) and gentamicin (9.0%). All isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, norfloxacin, choramphenicol and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim. It was concluded that the isolation of the Salmonella spp. from non-diarrhoeic dogs could pose health hazard to their owners as most serotypes are known to be virulent. Furthermore, the prevalence of resistance to antimicrobial agents amongst the Salmonella isolates from these animals indicates susceptibility testing may influence chemotherapeutic choices when treating these isolates.
