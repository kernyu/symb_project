The activity of the pristinamycin was investigated using disk diffusion agar or ATB PNEUMO system and MIC determination using reference liquid medium method (NCCLS) on 749 S. pneumoniae strains isolated in Aquitaine in 1999. We have realized the killing curves against 10 isolates selected from erythromycin-susceptible and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. All the strains tested by ATB PNEUMO system were susceptible to pristinamycin, using disk diffusion agar, 6.8% of strains were intermediate or resistant. However the MIC's of pristinamycin determined by liquid dilution method against these strains were < 1 mg/L. These data suggest that the zone of inhibition around the disk was not correlated with MIC for erythromycin pneumococci and MIC testing must be performed. The results of killing curves showed a very good and rapid bactericidal activity of pristinamycin within two hours for concentration equal to 4 x MIC and four hours for 2 x MIC.
