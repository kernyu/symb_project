Organophosphate resistant and susceptible tick larvae from laboratory strains of the southern cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus were exposed to low doses of the organophosphate (OP) acaricide, coumaphos. Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) was used to analyse differential gene expression in response to OP treatment and to compare the responses of OP-treated and -untreated resistant and susceptible tick larvae. An R. microplus Gene Index was used as an EST database to identify genes which corresponded to SAGE tags whose abundance changed in response to acaricide exposure. Relative quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm the differential expression results from the SAGE experiments. Of particular interest is a SAGE tag which corresponds to a cytochrome P450-like EST in the Gene Index which was more abundant in untreated OP resistant larvae compared to untreated OP susceptible larvae. This SAGE tag was also more abundant in OP resistant larvae treated with OP compared to OP susceptible larvae treated with OP.
