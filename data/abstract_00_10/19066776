A comprehensive, representative malaria survey has been carried out in a population of internally displaced persons (IDP) in the district of Gulu, Northern Uganda. It included 74 households and 390 persons, and covered socio-economic and environmental information, individual physical data, malaria and the drug sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum. The prevalence of infections with Plasmodium falciparum was 54.4% at a geometric mean asexual parasitaemia of 229/microl blood, typical for hyperendemic conditions. P. falciparum turned out to be highly resistant to chloroquine and amodiaquine. It showed also reduced sensitivity against lumefantrine and artemisinin, obviously the result of the liberal use of the lumefantrine-artemether combination without evidence-based indication.
