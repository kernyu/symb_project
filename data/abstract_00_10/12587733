Aspergillus niger produces extracellular beta-fructofuranosidase under submerged (SmF) and solid state fermentation (SSF) conditions. After UV mutagenesis of conidiospores of A. niger, 2-deoxyglucose (10 g/l) resistant mutants were isolated on Czapek's minimal medium containing glycerol as a carbon source and the mutants were examined for improved production of beta-fructofuranosidase in SmF and SSF conditions. One of such mutant DGRA-1 overproduced beta-fructofuranosidase in both SmF and SSF conditions. In SmF, the mutant DGRA-1 showed higher beta-fructofuranosidase productivity (110.8 U/l/hr) than the wild type (48.3 U/l/hr). While in SSF the same strain produced 322 U/l/hr of beta-fructofuranosidase, 2 times higher than that of wild type (154.2 U/l/hr). In SmF, both wild type and mutants produced relatively low level of beta-fructofuranosidase in medium containing sucrose with glucose than from the sucrose medium. However in SSF, the DGRA-1 mutant grown in sucrose and sucrose+ glucose did not show any difference with respect to beta-fructofuranosidase production. These results indicate that the catabolite repression of beta-fructofuranosidase synthesis is observed in SmF whereas in SSF such regulation was not prominent.
