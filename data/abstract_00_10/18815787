Plant PR10 is one of the pathogenesis related proteins, induced upon exposure to different stress conditions including fungal infection. PR10 proteins have been implicated in fungal disease resistance in some species; however its transcriptional regulation is not well understood. In the present work we cloned a PR10 gene from European plums (Prunus domestica L.) and monitored the quantitative changes in its transcript levels as a result of fungal infection in two varieties. We also studied the possible involvement of the membrane degrading enzyme phospholipase D-alpha (PLDalpha). In the susceptible variety, 'Veeblue', infection with the brown rot fungus Monilinia fructicola induced PLDalpha and PR10 expression, while in the resistant variety, 'Violette', a constitutive expression of PLDalpha and PR10 transcripts levels were observed. Resistance to M. fructicola also coincides with a sharp decrease in the expression of ABI1, a protein phosphatase and elevated hydrogen peroxide content after infection. Further, inhibition of PLDalpha by hexanal treatment, up-regulated ABI1 and decreased PR10 expression, suggesting a possible relationship between the two. We further confirm these results in Arabidopsis abi1 mutant that shows a higher level of PR10 transcripts.
