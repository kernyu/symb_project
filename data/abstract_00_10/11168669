This study describes a potential effect of topical gentian violet on cutaneous infection and nasal carriage with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 0.5% gentian violet was used in 28 cases of skin lesions once a day, while a 0.3% solution was applied on the nasal vestibules of nine cases twice a day. The period for eradication in the 28 skin cases was 9.1 +/- 6.0 days. It was 15.3 +/- 9.0 days for the nine nasal lesions. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of gentian violet against MRSA from the four isolated strains was 0.0225 +/- 0.0096 microg/mL. No adverse reactions occurred throughout the study. It is suggested that gentian violet may be potentially effective against MRSA.
