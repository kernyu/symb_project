The phytochemical investigation of the stem of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza yielded five new aromatic compounds (1-5), of which the bruguierols A - C (1-3) represent a new structural skeleton in natural product chemistry. All structures have been determined by NMR spectroscopic studies. Among them, 3 showed moderate activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including mycobacteria and resistant strains (MICs 12.5 microg/mL).
