Fifty-six Acinetobacter species strains (49 Acinetobacter baumanii, 5 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, 2 Acinetobacter iwoffii) were detected using both conventional methods and gas chromatography of bacterial fatty acids with the MIDI Sherlock Microbial Identification System. The susceptibilities of these strains to 16 antimicrobial agents were investigated by the disc-diffusion method according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and inducible beta-lactamases (IBLs) by the strains were investigated by the double-disc-synergy and disc-approximation methods, respectively. Imipenem was the most effective agent for Acinetobacter baumanii strains (95.9% of strains were sensitive), while meropenem and netilmicin showed moderate activity (87.7% and 79.6% of strains, respectively, responded). Acinetobacter baumanii strains were less sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactam (53.1%), ofloxacin (51.0%), ciprofloxacin (42.8%), and amikacin (36.7%). Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter iwoffii strains were sensitive to imipenem, meropenem and netilmicin. IBLs and ESBLs were produced, respectively, by 8.9% and 7.1% of all bacterial strains. The strains isolated were sufficiently sensitive to imipenem, but not to ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin, and were very resistant to amikacin.
