Topical mupirocin was able to interrupt colonization of 52% and 68% of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-colonized patients carrying mupirocin-resistant and -sensitive strains, respectively, including 44.4% and 85.7% of those colonized only in the nares. Although a trend to decreased effectiveness was seen for clearing mupirocin-resistant MRSA, this agent can decolonize many patients with resistant strains.
