Campylobacteriosis is a significant public health problem in many developed countries. Campylobacter jejuni is one of the leading causes of food-borne gastroenteritis and enteritis in humans. Treatment of campylobacteriosis is required in severe clinical infections, extraintestinal infections and in immunocompromised patients. Erythromycin is the proposed drug of choice for the treatment of Campylobacter infections. However, tetracycline and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin) are also clinically effective agents for treating infections caused by Campylobacter spp. High prevalence of C. jejuni resistant to fluoroquinolone and tetracycline have been recently reported in many countries. In human medicine new agents for the treatment of many serious infections are acutely needed in hospital practice. Tigecycline is a member of a new group of antibiotics--the glycylcyclines with an expanded microbiological spectrum. In our study we will determine the susceptibility of polish, resistant to tetracycline clinical C. jejuni isolates to tigecycline. All 94 tetracycline-resistant C. jejuni strains, with MICs between 8 and 256 mg/l, isolated between 2007 and 2008 were susceptible to tigecycline, with MICs 0.06 mg/1. Tigecycline may has potential therapeutic role in the treatment of serious Campylobacter infections.
