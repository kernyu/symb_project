The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Surveillance Program was designed to monitor the antimicrobial potency and spectrum of meropenem, and selected broad-spectrum comparison agents against pathogens from hospitalized patients. In the 2006 (year 8 of the study) United States sample, a total of 2841 isolates (94.7% compliance) including 641 Escherichia coli, 619 Klebsiella spp., 606 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 456 oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 300 streptococci, 149 Enterococcus faecalis, and 70 Gram-positive anaerobic organisms were tested by reference broth microdilution or agar dilution susceptibility methods. The carbapenems, especially meropenem, consistently demonstrated the lowest resistance rates against Enterobacteriaceae strains, and the fluoroquinolones had the highest and increasing resistance rates. The presence of qnr-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance was investigated using polymerase chain reaction methods but was only observed at very low levels (2.1%) and was not clonally associated. Confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates for E. coli and Klebsiella spp. were only 4.8% and 5.0%, respectively, with mobile AmpC (CMY-2 and FOX-5) enzymes shown in 13 additional Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Clonally related KPC-type serine carbapenemase production (57 strains, 9.5%) was observed at a rate 2-fold greater than the prior year among Klebsiella spp. isolates, primarily from 1 geographic region (Middle Atlantic States). These MYSTIC Program (2006) results demonstrate the continued need to monitor the carbapenem class potency and spectrum of activity against Enterobacteriaceae as well as P. aeruginosa because of the documented presence of serine carbapenemases and rare incidence of metallo-beta-lactamases that may further compromise their activity and that of other beta-lactam agents.
