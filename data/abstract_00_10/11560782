As novel anti-HIV agents, the G-tetrad-forming oligonucleotides have been explored for their structure-activity relations with regard to inhibition of integrase (IN) (N. Jing, Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs (2000) 9, 1777-1785). We have now developed two families of G-quartet oligonucleotides: T40217-T40222, with potential formation of a tail-to-tail G-quartet dimer, and T40224-T40227, with phosphorothioate (PT) linkages in the guanine loops. The results obtained from biophysical measurements and the assays of the inhibition of HIV-1 IN and virus replication demonstrated that an increase in the length of the G-quartet structure from a monomer (15A) to a tail-to-tail dimer (47A) does not distinctly disrupt the inhibition of HIV-1 IN activity or the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in cell cultures. G-quartet oligonucleotides were observed to induce molecular aggregation of HIV-1 IN and interrupt the binding of viral DNA to HIV-1 IN. Also, PT substitutions did not confer any advantages compared with the regular phosphodiesters for the inhibition of HIV-1 replication by intramolecular G-quartets. The G-quartet motif is the primary requirement for the remarkable nuclease resistance and pronounced biological efficacy of these oligonucleotides.
