We previously reported the case of a patient who became ill with Salmonella serotype Blockley after eating a chicken meal and who was still suffering symptoms of salmonella-reactive arthritis 10 years after the initial infection. The immunological consequences of infection were of concern and prompted a literature review because of the possibility that Salmonella Blockley may be more likely to cause long-term illness in certain patients than more common serovars. The review revealed the additional cause for concern of plasmid-borne extended spectrum beta-lactamases and the high frequency of integron-associated multidrug resistance in some isolates. The serovar was described in 1955 in the USA and Europe. It has become common in South East Asia and recently has been reported more often in Europe. A review of reactive arthritis outbreaks shows that information on the incidence and duration of the condition caused by serovars other than Salmonella serotype Enteritidis and Salmonella serotype Typhimurium is very limited. Rheumatologists can assist microbiologists and epidemiologists by reporting relevant cases of long-term reactive arthritis.
