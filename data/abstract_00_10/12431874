The level of genetic heterogeneity of nine isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant or intermediately susceptible to imipenem was determined by epidemiological typing using macrorestriction analysis of chromosomal DNA. The strains were isolated between December 2000 and February 2001 from a variety of specimens from nine patients hospitalized in five different departments of the University Medical Center in Ljubljana and in the nursing home. They belonged to seven genotypes or clones (A-G). Six isolates were heterogeneous, with different B-G genotypes. Three isolates had an identical A genotype but it is more likely that this genotype was more prone to develop imipenem resistance than to spread among the patients.
