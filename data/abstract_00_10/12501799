Harmful environmental agents [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)] have been ascertained to greatly stimulate the biosynthesis of arginine and urea and reduce the amount of sulfur-containing metabolites in the liver of experimental animals by increasing the level of sulfur sulfate. Against this background, contamination with Mycobacteria tuberculosis (MBT) inhibits the activity of arginine and drastically decreases its amount by elevating the concentration of sulfur-containing metabolites. The supplementary administration of sodium glutamate to animals receiving PAH and MBT potentiates a decrease in nitrogen-rich metabolites and increases the level of sulfur-containing metabolites guinea pigs, tuberculosis resistance being on the rise. Under the influence of a combined action of PAH and MBT, the mutagenic effect of the former lowered in rats.
