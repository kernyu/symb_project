Drug resistance trends were investigated for 1,318 enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) isolated from overseas traveler's diarrheal cases in Tokyo during 1988-1999. A total of 1.6% (21 strains) were nalidixic-acid resistant and fluoroquinolones (NFLX, OFLX, CPFX, LVFX, TFLX, SPFX; FQ) low-sensitive (or low-level-resistant). None of the strains were high-level-resistant to FQ. The FQ low-sensitive strains were isolated in 1996 for the first time, and increased from 3.4% in 1996 to 15.8% in 1999. Countries visited by travelers with the FQ low-sensitive ETEC were India (16 cases), Nepal (3 cases), Cambodia (1 case), and Egypt (1 case). Drug resistance-patterns of the FQ low-sensitive strains, including other drugs (CP, TC, SM, KM, ABPC, ST, NA, and FOM) tested, varied among the 6 types. Among those, multidrug resistant strains accounted for 57.1% (12 strains). The enterotoxin producing types of strains were LT (4 strains), ST (10 strains), and both (7 strains). The serotypes of the strains were classified into 16 types. The quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of the gyrA genes of the FQ low-sensitive strains were sequenced. The mutations of a Ser to a Leu at position 83 (Ser-83-->Leu) was found in 19 strains, and Asp-87-->Tyr was found in 2 strains.
