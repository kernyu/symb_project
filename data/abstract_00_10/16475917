With the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases and development of multi-drug resistance, there is a dire need to find newer cures and to produce more drugs and vaccines in the pipeline. To meet these increasing demands biomedical researchers and pharmaceutical companies are combining advanced methods of drug discovery, such as combinatorial chemistry, high-throughput screening and genomics, with conventional approaches using natural products and traditional knowledge. However, such approaches require much international cooperation and understanding of international laws and conventions as well as local customs and traditions. This article reviews the forty years of cumulative experience at the National Institutes of Health (initiated by the National Cancer Institute) in natural products drug discovery. It presents (1) three major cooperative programs (2) the legal mechanisms for cooperation and (3) illustrative case studies from these programs. We hope that these discussions and our lessons learned would be helpful to others seeking to develop their own models of cooperation for the benefit of global health.
