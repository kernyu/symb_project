Plant nonspecific lipid transfer protein(nsLTP) is a class of protein which has in vitro lipid transferring activity between biomembranes. In order to study the antimicrobial function of rice nonspecific lipid transfer protein, a gene LTP110 encoding rice nsLTP was cloned into ThioFusion expression vector pET32a (+) and expressed in host strain Bl21(DE3)trxB-. After induction by IPTG at 30 degrees C for 5 h, the fusion protein thio-LTP110 was in large amount produced. The expressed protein was purified by Ni2(+)-chelating Sepharose fast flow column, then digested by enterokinase. By passing through nickel affinity column again, the cleavage product, LTP110, was obtained. CD spectrum scanning from 185 nm to 250 nm showed that the recombinant protein LTP110 had similar secondary structure with the nsLTP purified from rice etiolated seedlings. Activity determination by fluorescent lipid P-96 showed that it had lipid binding activity. Microbial inhibition test results revealed that LTP110 deterred germination of the spores of rice pathogen P. oryzae, showing it might be involved in plant microbial resistance function. Therefore, it has the potential to be used in plant transgene engineering to improve plant resistance.
