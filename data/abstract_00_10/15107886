AIM: To estimate the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and to determine whether the increase in ciprofloxacin resistance observed in Auckland in 2001 had occurred in other parts of the country. METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae (isolated in New Zealand over a 4-month period between April and August 2002) was tested at either LabPlus, Auckland District Health Board, or at ESR, using the same agar dilution method. RESULTS: The prevalence of resistance to the antimicrobials tested was: ceftriaxone, 0%; ciprofloxacin, 6.8%; penicillin, 9.0%; spectinomycin, 0%; and tetracycline, 27.8%. There were few statistically significant geographical differences in resistance within New Zealand. Gonococcal infections acquired in Asia were more likely to be ciprofloxacin and penicillin resistant than infections acquired in New Zealand. CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin resistance among N. gonorrhoeae in New Zealand has reached a level where this antibiotic is no longer the most appropriate first-line treatment. In fact, ceftriaxone should now be considered the most reliable option for the treatment and control of gonorrhoea in New Zealand, particularly in the Northland/Auckland region.
