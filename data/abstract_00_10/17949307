The aim of this study was to describe consumption of glycopeptides and to study factors associated with their use in 47 French hospitals. Consumption of glycopeptides for systemic use (defined daily doses per 1,000 patient-days: DDD/1,000 PD and per 100 admissions), number of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (percentage and incidence per 1,000 patient-days), and number of venous central lines and hospital characteristics (size, length of stay, number of beds: total and for each hospital inpatient areas and antibiotic policies) were recorded from January, 2002, through December, 2002. Multiple linear regression was performed to check for hospital characteristics. The median rate of total consumption of glycopeptides was 4.11(range 0.21-27.22) DDD per 1,000 PD with higher consumption in large public hospitals and in intensive care areas (median 46.51; range 7.19-134) than in surgery areas (median 4.5; range 0.17-24.76). The consumption of glycopeptides correlated with MRSA incidence, but not with the proportion of MRSA. In the multivariate analysis, the incidence of MRSA and the number of beds in surgery areas were independent predictors of total glycopeptides use in the hospital, expressed in DDD per 1,000 PD (R2 adjusted, 0.39). The incidence of MRSA, the number of venous central lines, and the number of beds in the medicine areas were significant determinants associated with higher consumption of glycopeptides expressed in DDD per 100 admissions (R2 adjusted, 0.73). To reduce glycopeptides use in hospitals, the first effort required is that hospitals focus increased attention on the prevention of cross transmission for MRSA between patients but also on the use of the venous central line. Furthermore, hospitals have to compare their data with others to identify overuse of glycopeptides and to plan control interventions.
