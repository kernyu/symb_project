The phenotypical differences of H. pylori strains isolated in Georgia have been evaluated. Among H. pylori isolates, these strains have been found to differ from typical ones in the morphology of their colonies, growth under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions, alpha-hemolysin production, resistance to cephalotin and nalidixic acid. At the same time all the strains under study are no different from typical H. pylori strains in respect of their cell morphology, tinctoral properties, growth at different temperatures and their main biochemical properties.
