The antifungal drug susceptibility of 70 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates obtained in Spain from 1994 to 1996 (23 isolates) and from 1997 to 2005 (47 isolates) was investigated. The MICs of fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole were determined by the modified Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; formerly National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) broth microdilution method. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) for itraconazole and voriconazole did not change significantly from 1994 to 2005. The MIC(50) of fluconazole remained stable and the MIC(90) decreased by 2 log(2) dilution in the isolates collected from 1997 to 2005. We conclude that the in vitro resistance to fluconazole decreased over an 11-year period. In addition, a tendency for the development of possible cross-resistance between the three triazoles was observed.
