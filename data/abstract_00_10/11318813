OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether stepwise selection of resistance mutations may mirror the continued bacterial exposure to antibiotics that occurs in the clinical setting. METHODS: We examined the in vitro development of resistance to a number of commonly used antibiotics (cefepime, cefpirome, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin and imipenem) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a significant nosocomial pathogen. Stepwise resistance was assessed by serial passage of colonies located nearest to the inhibition zone on antibiotic-containing gradient plates. RESULTS: The lowest frequencies of spontaneous resistance mutations were found with cefepime and imipenem; these drugs also resulted in the slowest appearance of resistance of spontaneous resistance mutations. In five wild-type P. aeruginosa strains, cefepime-selected isolates required a mean of 30 passages to reach resistance; resistance occurred more rapidly in strains selected with other cephalosporins. P. aeruginosa strains that produced beta-lactamase or non-enzymatic resistance generally developed resistance more rapidly than wild-type strains. For most strains, resistance to all antibiotics except imipenem correlated with increased levels of beta-lactamase activity. Cross-resistance of cephalosporin-selected resistant mutants to other cephalosporins was common. Cephalosporin-resistant strains retained susceptibility to imipenem and ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: From our in vitro study, we can conclude that the rate of development of resistance of P. aeruginosa is lower with cefepime compared with other cephalosporines.
