To compare the differential antimicrobial susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecium from humans and whole chicken carcasses, MICs of 12 antimicrobial agents were determined for 54 clinical-isolates (31 vancomycin-resistant [VREF]) and 60 chicken-isolates (29 VREF). Chicken VREF were slightly but consistently more resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin and avoparcin, compared with human VREF (P<0.01). MICs of LY333328 were <or = 2 mg/l. All human VREF were resistant to erythromycin and tylosin, compared with only 58.6% of chicken VREF (P<0.01). Streptogramins were active against all isolates except four chicken strains. MIC(90s) of amoxycillin and gentamicin for human E. faecium were 8-16-fold higher than chicken isolates. Chicken VREF were significantly more resistant to tetracycline but more susceptible to chloramphenicol than human VREF (P<0.001).
