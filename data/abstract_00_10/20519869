Candidiasis is a common opportunistic fungal infection that responds well to amphotericin B (AMPH) treatment. However, AMPH often causes adverse effects such as kidney injury and hypokalemia. Because some essential oils have been reported to have antifungal effects, we investigated the antifungal activity of various essential oils and their major constituents against Candida spp. Most essential oils examined in this study showed antifungal activity, and several enhanced the antifungal effect of AMPH. Clove oil in particular, and its major constituent eugenol, had potent effects. These findings suggest that combining certain essential oils or their constituents with AMPH may be useful for suppressing the adverse effects of AMPH treatment.
