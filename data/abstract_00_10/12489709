A total of 67 strains of coagulase positive staphylococci isolated from healthy dogs and dogs suffering from otitis externa were studied. Twenty-two isolates were from healthy dogs (five from hound dogs and 17 from companion dogs) and 45 from dogs suffering otitis externa (14 from hound dogs and 31 from companion dogs). Presumptive identification was attempted using the following tests: production of acetoin, anaerobic utilization of mannitol, acid production from mannitol, presence of beta-galactosidase, and growth on P agar supplemented with different concentrations of acriflavine. Susceptibility of staphylococci to 16 antibiotics was determined. Most effective antibiotics were imipenem, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, gentamicin and marbofloxacin. Penicillin, ampicillin and polymyxin B showed the lowest activity. There were no significant differences in antimicrobial susceptibility among isolates from healthy dogs and dogs suffering from otitis externa.
