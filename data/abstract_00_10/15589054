This study is the first to evaluate biological response to first injections of interferon-beta (IFNbeta) in patients with multiple sclerosis. MxA mRNA was measured in 96 patients receiving IFNbeta-1a (Avonex, n=32), IFNbeta-1b (Betaferon, n=19), IFNbeta-1a (Rebif) 22 microg (n=30), or IFNbeta-1a 44 microg (n=15). Patients were analysed before, 3 and 24 h after the first injection, and 12 h after the second administration. Results showed that up-regulation was evident within 3 h of IFNbeta injection, peaked 12 h after injection, and progressively declined 24 h after administration. The cumulative responses were similar after a single administration, regardless of product/dose. Moreover, data indicate that the abolition of the biological activity detected during IFNbeta therapy is due to underlying phenomena (e.g., neutralizing antibodies), because all patients were constitutively responders to IFNbeta at treatment initiation.
