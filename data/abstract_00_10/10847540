AIMS: This paper reports the treatment of the periodontal component of the Papillon-Lefevre syndrome in 2 siblings (case A, born 1974; case B, born 1976). METHOD: The initial treatment, in 1982, consisted of extraction of all primary teeth, scaling and rootplaning of the erupted permanent teeth and systemic antibiotic therapy. During 15 years, continuous and intensive periodontal treatment consisted of chlorhexidine 0.2% rinses, bi-weekly professional prophylaxis, scaling and rootplaning or surgery if indicated. Systemic antibiotics often accompanied mechanical therapy after bacteriological analysis. RESULTS: In case A, a favourable number of permanent teeth could be maintained, but in case B, all permanent teeth were lost in spite of the intensive treatment. Darkfield microscopy at different intervals revealed high numbers of spirochetes and motile rods in both siblings. Only in case A were they temporarily reduced to zero after scaling and rootplaning combined with metronidazole. Anaerobic cultering revealed high numbers of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a) in both patients. In 1994, 2 years after combined amoxicillin/metronidazole therapy, no A.a could be detected in case A. In case B, A.a could still be detected and was found to be resistant to metronidazole. One year after extraction of all permanent teeth, could no A.a be detected in case B. CONCLUSION: Intensive periodontal treatment combined with antibiotic therapy was not able to prevent complete tooth loss in case B. In case A, the treatment was more effective, resulting in preserving a number of permanent teeth in a stable clinical situation. In these 2 cases, no attempt was made to create an edentulous period between the periodontally-diseased mixed dentition and the eruption of the remaining teeth, which may have contributed to treatment failure.
