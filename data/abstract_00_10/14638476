Mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium resistant to fusidic acid (Fusr) have mutations in fusA, the gene encoding translation elongation factor G (EF-G). Most Fusr mutants have reduced fitness in vitro and in vivo, in part explained by mutant EF-G slowing the rate of protein synthesis and growth. However, some Fusr mutants with normal rates of protein synthesis still suffer from reduced fitness in vivo. As shown here, Fusr mutants could be similarly ranked in their relative fitness in mouse infection models, in a macrophage infection model, in their relative hypersensitivity to hydrogen peroxide in vivo and in vitro, and in the amount of RpoS production induced upon entry into the stationary phase. We identify a reduced ability to induce production of RpoS (sigmas) as a defect associated with Fusr strains. Because RpoS is a regulator of the general stress response, and an important virulence factor in Salmonella, an inability to produce RpoS in appropriate amounts can explain the low fitness of Fusr strains in vivo. The unfit Fusr mutants also produce reduced levels of the regulatory molecule ppGpp in response to starvation. Because ppGpp is a positive regulator of RpoS production, we suggest that a possible cause of the reduced levels of RpoS is the reduction in ppGpp production associated with mutant EF-G. The low fitness of Fusr mutants in vivo suggests that drugs that can alter the levels of global regulators of gene expression deserve attention as potential antimicrobial agents.
