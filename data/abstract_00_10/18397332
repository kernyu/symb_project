This study determined the types of AmpC enzymes produced by Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and the clonality of these isolates. The presence of AmpC enzymes was identified by cephalosporin-cloxacillin synergy tests. Genes encoding AmpC enzymes were characterised by PCR and sequencing. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to type the isolates. Fifteen K. pneumoniae isolates were positive for bla(AmpC), 13 were positive for bla(ACC-1) and two were positive for bla(DHA-1). Production of the DHA-1 enzyme was inducible. The ampR gene was identified upstream of the bla(DHA-1) gene. PFGE demonstrated the polyclonal origin of the isolates carrying bla(ACC-1).
