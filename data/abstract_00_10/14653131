OBJECTIVE: To find out the changes in the infective pathogens and their drug resistance in burned patients. METHODS: The patients were divided into two groups. The first group was from July 1991 to June 1996, and the second group was from July 1996 to June 2001. The bacteria of burned body surface and blood were cultured, and the bacteria and their drug sensitivity were analyzed. RESULTS: Gram-negative bacteria were the major bacteria in burn infection, among which Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the top. Staphylococcus aureous ranked the first among the Gram-positive bacteria, and the isolation rate of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased; The isolation rate of Enterobacter cloacae (10.4%), Escherichia coli (8.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.3%), and fungus (4.2%) all rose. The antibiotic resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureous increased. CONCLUSION: The changes in pathogens of burn infection and bacterial drug resistance are related to the wide use of broad spectrum antibiotics such as cefazidime and imepenem, suggesting that dynamic observation of changes in pathogenic strains and sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics are useful for clinical prevention and cure of burn infection.
