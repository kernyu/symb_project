AIM: To ascertain and describe the patients' knowledge, perceptions and experiences of being methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) positive. BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a serious global threat. MRSA can cause wound infection, pneumonia, septicaemia and mortality. This qualitative study has focused on patients' experiences of living with MRSA. METHODS: Fifteen patients with MRSA-infected wounds were interviewed. All data were transcribed verbatim and analysed according to content analysis. FINDINGS: Information about the MRSA diagnosis often caused a shock-like reaction. Patients' perception of being MRSA positive was stigmatizing as plague or leprosy; they felt dirty and felt that they were a severe threat to their environment. Fears of infecting someone else and being rejected were commonly expressed. The key findings emerged as a theme: Being exposed to others' shortcomings and being a threat to others' health. Three categories were identified: understanding and emotional reactions, treatment by the healthcare professionals and consequences and expectations. Gaps in both patient and staff knowledge of MRSA led to unnecessary misunderstandings, causing fear, social isolation and suffering. CONCLUSIONS: Living with MRSA can be extremely stressful for the patients. Knowledge and empathy from staff involved in their care is crucial to optimize patients' experiences. Staff education to meet patients' demand for information and prevent contamination is essential.
