We sought to define the recommended dose of cyclophosphamide (CTX) for subsequent phase II assessment when combined with fixed doses of gemcitabine (Gemzar; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN) and 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid in metastatic breast cancer patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. Patients age 70 or less, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, were enrolled. Patients received gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2), 5-fluorouracil 425 mg/m(2), folinic acid 100 mg/m(2), and escalating doses of CTX (in 100-mg/m(2) increments), starting at 500 mg/m(2), on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Since March 1999, 46 patients, with a median age of 51 years (range, 38 to 74 years), entered the trial in seven cohorts. Cyclophosphamide dose escalation was stopped at 600 mg/m(2) when three of six patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (one each with grade 3 thrombocytopenia, grade 3 neutropenia, and persistent grade 2 neutropenia), and then continued with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support. The CTX dose of 800 mg/m(2) was proven safe and was chosen for phase II study. Two complete and 15 partial responses provided an overall response rate of 37% (95% confidence interval, 23% to 51%). Gemcitabine/CTX/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid is well tolerated by metastatic breast cancer patients pretreated with anthracyclines/taxanes, up to a CTX dose of 800 mg/m(2). The phase II study is ongoing. Semin Oncol 28 (suppl 10):50-56.
