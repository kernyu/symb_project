An in vitro study of the activity of 10 oral agents against 153 pediatric isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae identified moxifloxacin and levofloxacin as the most active agents regardless of penicillin or macrolide susceptibility. Moxifloxacin inhibited all strains at 0.25 microg/ml and was 8- to 16-fold more potent than levofloxacin.
