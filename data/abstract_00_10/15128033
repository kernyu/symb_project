Two-week-old Phaseolus vulgaris plants, wick-fed with 1 mmol/L salicylic acid (SA) or 50 nmol/L dihydrozeatin (DHZ), showed partial inhibition of the accumulation of white clover mosaic virus (WClMV) in infected primary leaves. This inhibition was measured as a decrease in the accumulation of both viral mRNA and viral coat protein, especially at the early stages of infection. Salicylic acid treatment resulted in moderately increased expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), NPR1, PR1 and HSP70 genes that participate in resistance to pathogens in plants. In contrast, DHZ treatments did not induce significant changes in expression of these genes. The expression of the P. vulgaris alternative oxidase (AOX) gene homolog, an enzyme implicated in plant resistance to viruses, showed low constitutive expression during the first 11 days post-infection and was not affected by either SA or DHZ. It appears that, while SA induced the NPR1-PR1 pathogen defense pathway genes, both SA and DHZ may use a different pathway to induce resistance to WClMV infection in P. vulgaris plants.
