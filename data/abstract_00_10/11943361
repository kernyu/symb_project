A method based on PCR-SSCP has been developed to detect presumptive Inhibitor-Resistant TEM (IRT) beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli. The capacity of this technique to differentiate genes from 11 control strains encoding IRT beta-lactamases was evaluated with PCR products digested with RsaI. All the bla(TEM) genes studied could be distinguished by their electrophoretic mobilities. Applied to 29 epidemiologically unrelated clinical isolates of E. coli resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate (MIC, > or =32 microg/ml), the electrophoretic mobilities of the digested bla(TEM) PCR products were identical to those of the reference bla(TEM-1A) (6 strains) and bla(TEM-1B) (18 strains) genes. The remaining five bla(TEM) PCR products displayed SSCP profiles different from those of the reference bla(TEM) genes and their nucleotide sequence identified them as bla(TEM-1C) in one strain, bla(TEM-30/IRT-2) in two strains, bla(TEM-37/IRT-8) in one strain, and bla(TEM-40/IRT-11) in one isolate. Overexpression of the wild-type bla(TEM-1) gene, as detected by high-level resistance to beta-lactams and enzyme assay, accounted for resistance in the 24 E. coli containing bla(TEM-1). We report a simple one PCR step SSCP that can be used in epidemiological studies for rapid preliminary detection of IRT beta-lactamases; identification should be confirmed by sequence data.
