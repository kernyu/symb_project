Third-generation cephalosporin resistance is often mediated by TEM- and SHV-type beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae. TEM-type and OXA-1 enzymes are the major plasmid-borne beta-lactamases implicated in amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resistance in Escherichia coli isolates. We have developed a rapid and simple multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which discriminates bla(TEM), bla(SHV) and bla(OXA-1) genes by generating fragments of 516, 392 and 619 bp respectively. Multiplex PCR analysis of 51 amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant E. coli isolates detected bla(TEM) and bla(SHV) genes in 45 and two strains, respectively, and only one strain harboured a bla(OXA-1) gene. Twenty-three of the 40 cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates produced amplicons with a size compatible with the presence of bla(TEM) (13 strains), bla(SHV) (six strains) genes or the association of both genes (four strains). These results were verified by colony hybridisation. Therefore, multiplex PCR is a suitable tool for initial rapid screening of bla genes in Enterobacteriaceae.
