To investigate occurrence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in udder pathogens MICs in Staphylococcus aureus (n=211), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n=56), Streptococcus uberis (n=113), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (n=152), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=6), Escherichia coli (n=163), and Klebsiella spp. (n=42) were determined using microdilution. Isolates were from a nation wide survey employing strict inclusion criteria. Presence of acquired resistance was evaluated by species-specific epidemiological cut-off values issued by EUCAST. Penicillin or methicillin resistance in staphylococci were however evaluated by beta-lactamase production or presence of the mecA gene, respectively. Staphylococci were mostly susceptible to antimicrobials tested but 7.1% of S. aureus and 12.5% of CNS were resistant to penicillin by beta-lactamase production. Methicillin resistance was not found in S. aureus. All Streptococcus dysgalactiae and S. agalactiae were susceptible to penicillin. Bimodal MIC distributions for tetracycline in S dysgalactiae and S. uberis indicate acquired resistance in some isolates. Among E. coli 12.3% of isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. Resistance to streptomycin (11.0%), sulphametoxazole (8.6%), ampicillin (7.4%), or tetracycline (4.9%) were the most common traits. Klebsiella spp. were resistant to ampicillin and some isolates also to tetracycline (7.1%) or sulphonamide (9.5%). The study shows that in Sweden bacteria associated with acute clinical mastitis for the most part are susceptible to antimicrobials used in therapy but resistance to penicillin in S. aureus is not uncommon. Penicillin is recommended for treatment of mastitis caused by gram-positive pathogens and regular monitoring of beta-lactamase production in S. aureus is therefore recommended in herds with udder health problems.
