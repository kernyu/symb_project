GAR-936, a new semisynthetic derivative of minocycline, has earlier shown promising activity against tetracycline-resistant pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. In this study, the activity of GAR-936 was tested against a total of 514 tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. All strains of H. influenzae, were inhibited by < or =2 mg/l of GAR-936, with MIC(90)s for all streptococci and gonococci of < or =0.5 mg/l. Scattergrams of GAR-936 comparing MICs by broth microdilution testing and zone diameters using 30 microg disks, confirmed the proposed susceptibility criteria of < or 2 mg/l or > or =20 mm zone diameter. Clinical trial results should be correlated with these preliminary in vitro results to confirm and/or adjust these susceptibility interpretive criteria for GAR-936 when testing fastidious streptococci, H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae.
