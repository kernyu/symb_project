In order to mitigate the strong microbial resistance of benz(a)anthracene [B(a)A] in soil, a hybrid treatment of Fenton oxidation followed microbial culture was carried out. Based on optimal Fenton oxidation. i.e., 1.0 ml of ethanol, 0.2 ml of 0.5 M Fe2+, and 0.3 ml of 30% H2O2 per 1 g of 500 mg B(a)A/kg soil, about 43% of B(a)A-7,12-dione was generated during oxidation of 97% B(a)A. When the comparative biodegradability between B(a)A-contaminated soil and B(a)A-contaminated soil after Fenton oxidation was examined, it was found that 98% of B(a)A-7,12-dione degraded after 63 d in comparison with only 12% of B(a)A over the same period; results demonstrating that Fenton oxidation enhances biodegradability of B(a)A through B(a)A-7,12-dione.
