Over an eight-month period from October 1997 to May 1998, four patients who had received bone marrow transplant (BMT) from unrelated donor presented with severe mucosal cutaneous infections involving acyclovir resistant herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). The four isolates were acyclovir (ACV) resistant, three of which were also foscarnet resistant as determined by the dye uptake method. The sequencing of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene did not permit to establish a relation between mutations and resistance to ACV. Three patients were considered as clinically cured of their HSV infection by replacement of ACV or foscarnet with either valacyclovir (one case) or cidofovir (two cases) but eventually two of them died of graft vs host disease. One patient died of extensive HSV infection despite administration of cidofovir. This study emphasizes the importance of monitoring the herpes virus resistance to antiviral drugs in bone marrow transplant recipients and the usefulness of the evaluation of novel antiviral drug for treatment of infections due to strains of HSV resistant to ACV and foscarnet that occur in about 5% of immunocompromised patients.
