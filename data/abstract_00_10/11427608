Although imipenem has in vitro activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Food and Drug Administration-approved indications for treatment of infections caused by this microorganism, there are no NCCLS guidelines for susceptibility testing of imipenem versus enterococci. Therefore, the in vitro activities of penicillin, ampicillin, imipenem, and vancomycin against 201 blood isolates of E. faecalis and 24 blood isolates of Enterococcus faecium were compared. The susceptibility of isolates to penicillin or ampicillin accurately predicted the in vitro activity of imipenem. Since the susceptibility of enterococci to imipenem can be predicted by the results obtained by testing of penicillin or ampicillin, testing of imipenem by clinical laboratories probably is not necessary.
