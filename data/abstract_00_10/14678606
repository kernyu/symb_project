The prevalence of genetic drug resistance in newly diagnosed HIV-1 cases and potential subtype-specific mutation patterns were studied. Samples from 100 newly diagnosed patients were randomly chosen from three HIV clinics in Sweden, prospectively collected during the period June 1998 to August 2001. Viral RNA was extracted from plasma and an approximately 2000-bp fragment covering the protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes was sequenced. Subtypes A, B, C, D, G, U, and CRF01_AE were found. All 100 sequences had mutations reported to be involved in some drug resistance, revealing naturally occurring subtype-specific amino acid patterns. Such patterns may be important to consider when treating patients infected with nonsubtype B viruses. While many drug resistance mutations seem to be naturally occurring, 9% of the newly detected patients in Sweden may have been infected with virus from antiviral-treated patients. Among the individuals infected with resistant virus, the majority were infected with subtype B virus and belonged to the homosexual risk group. It may be important to routinely test for resistance in newly infected cases to improve the choice of drugs for treatment because the virus may revert and resistant forms can become latent.
