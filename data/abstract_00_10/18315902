This study was aimed to explore the changes of soluble resistance-related calcium binding protein (sorcin) expression in reversion of multidrug resistance of K562/A02 leukemic cell line with different concentrations of tetrandrine (Tet), so as to provide a new theoretic evidence for clinical application of Tet. The inhibition of K562/A02 cell line by daunorubicin (DNR) was assayed by MTT method. The changes of SORCIN gene expression were assayed by RT-PCR. The changes of SORCIN protein expressed were assayed by Western blot. The results showed that Tet could enhance the cytotoxicity of DNR to K562/A02 cells (the IC(50) of DNR + Tet was 11.3+/-0.17 mg/L, 5.15+/-0.10 mg/L, 3.91+/-0.06 mg/L, and 2.52+/-0.04 mg/L, when concentrations of Tet were 0 mg/L, 0.5 mg/L, 1.0 mg/L, and 2.0 mg/L respectively). The gene encoding sorcin was highly expressed in K562/A02 cells, the expression of which was firstly enhanced in Tet concentration 0.5 mg/L, then attenuated in Tet concentration of 1.0, 2.0 mg/L (p<0.05). Sorcin protein expressed lowly in K562 cells and highly in K562/A02 cells, but the expression of SORCIN protein in K562/A02 cells was enhanced in Tet concentration of 0.5 mg/L, then was attenuated in Tet concentration of 1.0, 2.0 mg/L (p<0.05). It is concluded that the effect of Tet on reversal of K562/A02 drug-resistance shows concentration dependence by MTT assay. Tet reverses multidrug-resistance of K562/A02 cells through regulation of expression of SORCIN gene and protein, but not fully correlates to the reversing effect.
