While previously recognized antibiotic-resistant bacteria continue to increase in frequency and numbers globally, new resistance problems have recently emerged which further complicate and impede treatment of critical infectious diseases. Vancomycin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus, extended spectrum beta-lactamases among gram-negative pathogens, and fluoroquinolone resistance among already multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Neisseria gonorrheae are adding to the toll of resistance on patients suffering with infectious diseases.
