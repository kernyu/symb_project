We report the first strain of glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium from Europe that contains a vanD allele isolated from blood cultures of an immunocompromised patient hospitalized in a French university hospital. Based on phenotypic results, PCR sequencing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and Southern blotting, the isolate was assigned to E. faecium with a chromosomally located VanD allele most closely related to the VanD1 allele.
