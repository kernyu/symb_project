Antituberculosis drug resistance is a major factor threatening the success of tuberculosis control programmes. The aim of this study was to reveal the patterns of antituberculosis drug resistance in a secondary hospital in Turkey and to compare with national data. The results of BACTEC MGIT 960 system for susceptibility testing were retrospectively analysed on 76 clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates from different patients. The mean age of 48 men (63.2%) and 28 women was 37 and 39, respectively. Overall resistance rate to isoniazid was 14.5%, followed by streptomycin 9.2%, ethambutol 6.9% and rifampin 5.3%. Female sex and diabetes mellitus but not the presence of cavitary lesion or radiological involvement was a risk factor for the development of drug resistance. Anemia, leukocytosis or thrombocytosis was not associated with the drug resistance. In conclusions, further studies should be conducted regularly to monitor drug resistance in Turkey in order to manage effectively national tuberculosis control efforts.
