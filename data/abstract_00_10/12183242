A rat model was used to investigate the efficacy of quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D) in the prevention of vascular prosthetic graft infection due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis with intermediate resistance to glycopeptides. The in vitro activity of the compound was compared to that of vancomycin by MIC determination and time-kill study. Moreover, the efficacy of collagen-sealed Q-D-soaked Dacron was evaluated in a rat model of graft infection. Graft infections were established in the subcutaneous tissue of the backs of 120 adult male Wistar rats. The in vivo study included a control group, one contaminated group that did not receive any antibiotic prophylaxis, two contaminated groups that received grafts soaked with 10 and 100 micro g of Q-D per ml, respectively, and two contaminated groups that received grafts soaked with 10 and 100 micro g of vancomycin per ml, respectively. Rats that received Dacron grafts soaked with 100 micro g of Q-D per ml showed no evidence of infection (<10 CFU/ml). In contrast, for rats that received Dacron grafts soaked with 10 micro g of Q-D per ml and Dacron grafts soaked with 10 or 100 micro g of vancomycin per ml, the quantitative graft cultures demonstrated 2.2 x 10(2) +/- 1.3 x 10(2), 2.2 x 10(6) +/- 1.9 x 10(5), and 5.6 x 10(2) +/- 0.3 x 10(2) CFU/ml, respectively. Taken together the results of the study demonstrate that the use of Dacron grafts soaked with Q-D can result in significant bacterial growth inhibition and show that this compound is potentially valuable for prevention of vascular prosthetic graft infection.
