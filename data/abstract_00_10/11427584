A rapid drug susceptibility test to measure the susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF) using clinical isolates and a newly defined mycolic acid index (MAI) was evaluated. A total of 200 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis were tested for susceptibility or resistance to INH and RIF by the MAI susceptibility and indirect-proportion methods. Overall, there was agreement between the two methods for 398 (99.5%) of the 400 total tests. Specifically, the sensitivity of the MAI susceptibility method for INH and RIF was 97.6 and 100%, respectively. The specificity and positive predictive value were 100% for both drugs, and the negative predictive value for INH and RIF was 98.3 and 100%, respectively. In conclusion, the MAI susceptibility method described here can be used for rapid drug susceptibility testing of M. tuberculosis clinical isolates within 5 days after clinical isolates are incubated in the presence or absence of an antituberculosis drug.
