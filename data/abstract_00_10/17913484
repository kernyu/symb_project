Amphotericin B (Amp B) is considered as a drug of choice for treatment of fungal infections, but it causes severe side effects such as renal damage. To lessen the severity, it is often combined with the azole, but data reporting resistance of Candida albicans to the azole have been recently increasing. Thus, finding a new product that can reduce Amp B dose by combination seems to be important. In the present study, we investigated a synergic effect of grape seed extract (GSE) combined with Amp B against the fungus. Our results showed that the GSE alone inhibited growth of C. albicans yeast cells, and that in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis mice groups given GSE before intravenous inoculation with the yeast cells survived longer than diluent-received (control) mice groups (P<0.05). This GSE antifungal effect was dose-dependent. Upon combination of GSE plus Amp B, the combination therapy strikingly retarded the yeast growth as determined by the broth susceptibility method. Against the disseminated disease, mice given diluent (negative control), Amp B (0.5mg/kg of body weight), or GSE (2mg/kg of body weight) had mean survival times (MSTs) of approximately 11.4, 14.4, and 17.6 days, respectively. However, mice treated with the combination of the doses of Amp B and GSE had a MST value of 38.4 days, surviving an average of 24 days longer than Amp B alone-treated mice groups. This MST value from the combination-received mice group was greater than the MST value from the mice group given four times the Amp B dose (2mg/kg of body weight). All these data indicate that the combination therapy can reduce more than 75% of Amp B dose, implying that GSE has a synergic effect with Amp B.
