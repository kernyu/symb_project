One of the common hindrances to successful chemotherapy is the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) by tumor cells to multiple chemotherapeutic agents. In this regard, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) acts as an energized drug pump that reduces the intracellular concentration of drugs, even of structurally unrelated ones. The modulators of P-gp function can restore the sensitivity of MDR cells to anticancer drugs. Therefore, to develop effective drug-resistance-reversing agents, we evaluated the P-gp modulating potential of carnosic acid (CA) in multidrug-resistant K562/AO2 cells in the present study. The reversing effect of CA was evaluated by determining the inhibition rates of cell viability with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assays. The intracellular adriamycin fluorescence intensity and the expression of P-gp were measured by flow cytometry (FCM). Meanwhile, the subcellular distribution of adriamycin was detected via Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM). The mRNA expression of mdrlwas then detected via semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The findings showed that CA decreased apparently the Inhibition Concentration 50% (IC50) of adriamycin by increasing its intracellular concentration and thus enhancing the sensitivity of K562/AO2 cells. Adriamycin was distributed evenly in the cytoplasm when the cells were treated with CA. The expression of mdrl was decreased. Overall, the results indicated that CA can serve as a novel, non-toxic modulator of MDR, and it can reverse the MDR of K562/AO2 cells in vitro by increasing intracellular adriamycin concentration, down-regulating the expression of mdrl, and inhibiting the function of P-gp.
