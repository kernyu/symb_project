We have evaluated the clinical potential of stavudine-5'-(p-bromophenyl methoxyalaninyl phosphate(stampidine [STAMP]), a novel aryl phosphate derivative of stavudine, as a new anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) agent, by examining its acute, subacute, and chronic toxicity profile in mice as well as by testing its antiviral activity in a surrogate human peripheral blood lymphocyte (Hu-PBL)-SCID mouse model of human AIDS. STAMP was very well tolerated in BALB/c and CD-1 mice, without any detectable acute or subacute toxicity at single intraperitoneal or oral bolus doses as high as 500 mg/kg of body weight. Notably, daily administration of STAMP intraperitoneally or orally for up to 8 consecutive weeks was not associated with any detectable toxicity at cumulative dose levels as high as 6.4 g/kg. Micromolar concentrations of the active STAMP metabolite in plasma were rapidly achieved and maintained for more than 4 h after parenteral as well as oral administration of a nontoxic 100-mg/kg bolus dose of STAMP. In accordance with its favorable pharmacokinetic profile and in vitro potency, STAMP exhibited dose-dependent and potent in vivo anti-HIV activity in Hu-PBL-SCID mice against a genotypically and phenotypically nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant clinical HIV type 1 (HIV-1) isolate (BR/92/019; D67N, L214F, T215D, K219Q) at nontoxic dose levels. The remarkable in vivo safety and potency of STAMP warrants the further development of this promising new antiretroviral agent for possible clinical use in patients harboring NRTI-resistant HIV-1.
