PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of orally administered trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) on the prevalence, species distribution, and resistance of the conjunctival bacterial flora in adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study, with clinical and experimental laboratory investigation. METHODS: Samples from the inferior conjunctival fornix were collected and submitted for culture to evaluate aerobic flora. RESULTS: Sixty samples were collected. Negative cultures were found in 17 (56.7%) eyes of the TMP-SMZ group and in 10 (33%) of the control group (P = .036). All Staphylococcus species isolates in the TMP-SMZ group were resistant to the drug, whereas 50% of the control group presented this finding (P = .025). In the study group, all bacteria were resistant to TMP-SMZ, compared with only 47% of the microorganisms in the control group. CONCLUSION: Orally administered TMP-SMZ in patients with HIV infection seems to exert a selection pressure in the microorganisms present on the conjunctiva.
