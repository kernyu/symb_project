Scedosporium apiospermum, the asexual form of Pseudallescheria boydii, is a ubiquitous fungus that represents an unfrequent complication of immune suppression. It accounts for 20% of all non-Aspergillus mold infections in organ transplant recipients. The infection can be localized or disseminated in multiple organs, including lungs, brain, joints, tendons, and skin, and is difficult to treat, due to resistance of S apiospermum to amphotericin B and other antifungal agents. The mortality rate is about 50%. To our knowledge, there are no prospective studies or registries of transplant recipients to guide diagnosis and there are no evidence-based recommendations for the optimal management of this infection. We report a case of S apiospermum infection in a woman with renal transplantation. The first occurrence of infection was a solitary nodule on the forearm, which was surgically excised. Two following relapses were disseminated to the knee, the Achilles tendon, and the skin of the left leg. The infection was successfully treated with voriconazole, but due to the severe iatrogenic immune suppression, a strong reduction in immunosuppressant drugs was needed.
