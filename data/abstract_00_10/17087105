Enterococcus faecalis isolates were examined by an automated identification and susceptibility system. Almost all of the 97 isolates were ampicillin susceptible (n = 86) and tetracycline resistant (n = 89). All were nitrofurantoin susceptible. About a third of isolates showed high level resistance to the aminoglycosides streptomicin and gentamicin and this was usually associated with ciprofloxacin resistance (n = 34). Seven isolates were vancomycin resistant, including one that was ampicillin resistant. Most forms of resistance described elsewhere were found
