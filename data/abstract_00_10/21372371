The objective of present study was to determine the profile and antimicrobial sensitivity pattern of bacteria isolated from various cultures in a tertiary hospital in Delhi. Culture and sensitivity of all blood, urine, pus, and throat sample reports obtained from May 2006 to April 2007 were analyzed from the central microbiology laboratory register. Among 6918 sample reports analyzed, about half (46%) of them were positive. The most commonly bacteria isolated in 35% of positive blood and pus samples was vancomycin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Most common organism isolated in 54% of positive urine samples was imepenem-sensitive Escherichia coli.
