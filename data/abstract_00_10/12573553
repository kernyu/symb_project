The susceptibility of Campylobacter jejuni strains (n = 50) against nine antimicrobials were determined in comparison with Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) and agar dilution method to further investigate the correlation between the two methods. All the strains were isolated from stool samples of patients with diarrhea in 1998 and found to be highly susceptible (>84%) to ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and erythromycin. The essential agreement between two methods was 66.6% (+/-1 log(2) dilution) and 85.5% (+/-2 log(2) dilution). The agreement of susceptibility categories was higher at 94.4%.
