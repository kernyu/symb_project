OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence of extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in Chest Disease Institute. World Health Organization has given the definition of XDR-TB as multi-drug resistant tuberculosis which also resists fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The present study was a retrospective review and conducted at Microbiology Unit, Chest Disease Institute. Drug susceptibility testing against fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside have been done routinely since 1997. Laboratory results were studied to find XDR-TB patients and medical record information were reviewed. Laboratory results in 2006-2007 were not completed so were not included in the review. RESULTS: The result of the present study showed that from 1997 to 2005. 10,289 patients were tested for drug susceptibility. XDR-TB was found in 39 patients. Prevalence of XDR-TB was 6, 6, 9, 4, 3, 3, 2, 4 and 2 patients from 1997-2005 respectively. Most of XDR-TB patients were also resistant to Streptomycin and 39% resistant to Ethambutol. No data of resistance to second line drugs of XDR-TB was done in the present study. CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed the existing of XDR-TB in Thai patient for a long time but not in increasing rate. The authorized TB Control organization should take XDR-TB as an important problem and developed capacity of tuberculosis laboratory in order to be able to diagnose XDR-TB.
