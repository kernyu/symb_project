During the occasional testing of Escherichia coli from faecal samples of young calves we observed multi-resistant isolates. Because of the significance of E. coli as an indicator bacterium for resistance trends we tested E. coli populations of young calves over a longer period. Here we present the results of a retrospective study comparing isolates from 1998 to 2000. Moreover, we compared, in a clinical study, the resistance rates of E. coli populations from 67 hospitalized calves both before and after hospitalization (with or without anti-microbial therapy), and with their anamnestic data of antibiotic usage. The highest resistance rates were found to be more than 80% for tetracyclines, ampicillin, sulfonamide/trimethoprim combinations, and chloramphenicol. A significant increase or decrease over the years was not observed. In analysing the data of hospitalized calves, an increase of resistance to some anti-microbials had to be registered that seemed to be connected with the selective pressure due to agents used in the clinic. In comparing anamnestic data and resistance rates it became obvious that reliable data are not easily available and that a number of potential anti-microbial influence factors have to be taken into account.
