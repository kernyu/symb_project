Rhodinosyl transferase gene lndGT4, governing the conversion of the disaccharide oligoketide ('polyketide') landomycin D into a trisaccharide derivative landomycin E, was deleted in Streptomyces globisporus 1912 genome. Possible resistance mechanisms that protect the resulting landomycin D-producing mutant strain S. globisporus LD3 against the toxic action of landomycins were determined.
