Bacteria can grow as free-floating, planktonic bacteria or complex communities called biofilms. Biofilms promote bacterial growth and diversity and offer bacteria unique environments, including aerobic and anaerobic layers, that facilitate resistance to antimicrobial therapies. Respiratory and related structures provide ideal environments for the development of bacterial biofilms, which predispose patients to recurrent and chronic infections. Biofilms are important for the persistence of chronic rhinosinusitis, pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis, chronic otitis media, and device-related infections. Antimicrobial therapy that is proven effective against planktonic bacteria is often insufficiently effective against the defenses of biofilms. Furthermore, biofilms modify themselves following exposure to antimicrobial therapy, thus developing increased resistance. Understanding the nature of biofilms in common pediatric infections is essential to comprehending the expected course of bacterial illness and identifying treatments that are most likely to be beneficial against more resistant biofilms.
