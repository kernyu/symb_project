PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Access to second-line therapy in low- and middle-income countries has been limited to date. The WHO predicts that between 500 000 and 800 000 HIV-infected people on first-line combination antiretroviral therapy will require switch to second-line therapy by 2010. This paper aims to describe and review access to second-line therapy in low- and middle-income countries at present and examine future possibilities. RECENT FINDINGS: The majority of HIV-infected patients failing first-line combination antiretroviral therapy is identified by way of routine monitoring of clinical and immunological status as a surrogate for virological monitoring. Evidence suggests that immunological and clinical monitoring lack both sensitivity and specificity for virological failure. Consequently, at treatment failure, patients have often selected a degree of resistance within the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor class that questions the efficacy of using nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors in a second-line regimen. There is a paucity of good-quality evidence on which to base guidelines and policy. Optimally, a second-line regimen would be simple, potent, tolerable and lend itself to provision according to the successful 'public health' approach. SUMMARY: Provision of second-line therapy to HIV-infected individuals failing first-line therapy is a major challenge to the ongoing success of access to HIV care programmes in low- and middle-income countries. The optimal second-line combination antiretroviral therapies are unknown. Research trials to help define best practice are in advanced stages of development and implementation.
