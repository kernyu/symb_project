BACKGROUND: Agrobacteria are Gram-negative tumorigenic plant pathogens that rarely cause infections in humans. METHODS: The authors describe a 7-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who carried a central venous catheter and developed bacteremia due to Agrobacterium radiobacter (A. radiobacter). RESULTS: Microbiological cure was achieved after administration of systemic ceftriaxone along with gentamicin lock therapy to the central venous catheter for 10 days. Catheter removal was not required, and the patient has not relapsed with bacteremia due to the same pathogen for more than 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: A. radiobacter is an emerging pathogen affecting immunocompromised children, particularly those with leukemia who carry central venous catheters. Although it has a low virulence, erratic susceptibility patterns, and high frequency of resistance to many antibiotics, ceftriaxone appears to be successful in treatment of most cases. Catheter removal for the clearance of bloodstream infections due to A. radiobacter may not be required in selected patients like the present case.
