Treatment options for HIV-infection have been improved significantly. Drugs with new modes of action have been licensed (integrase inhibitor and CCR5-inhibitor) as well as drugs within the existing classes, but improved activity in case of resistance (e.g. darunavir, tipranavir, etravirin). The treatment goal today is complete and durable suppression of viral replication in treatment-naive as well as pre-treated patients. The significance of new drugs in the clinical setting will be defined more precisely in the near future, as all new substances have been licensed for pre-treated patients only so far.
