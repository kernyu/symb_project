Fourteen out of 16 carbapenem-resistant quinolone-susceptible Enterobacter cloacae isolates were found to carry qnrB2 and bla(KPC-2) genes encoded on the same plasmid. One isolate also carried the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene. Coexistence of quinolone resistance determinants and bla(KPC-2) on the same plasmid in quinolone-susceptible E. cloacae isolates may have important clinical implications.
