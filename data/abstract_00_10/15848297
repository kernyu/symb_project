We evaluated retrospectively, 10 MRSA meningitis cases in our hospital that occurred between January 1999 and June 2004. All were post-neurosurgical and were considered to have hospital-acquired meningitis. Fever, leukocytosis, variable conscious levels were the most common findings. Six patients were treated with regimens including teicoplanin, and four with vancomycin. Mean duration of treatment was 23.5+/-18.8 days (range, 3-60 days). One patient died. In cases of MRSA meningitis, intravenous vancomycin is the mainstay of therapy. However, six of these 10 patients were successfully treated with regimens including teicoplanin, suggesting that this agent may be an alternative to vancomycin in the therapy of these cases.
