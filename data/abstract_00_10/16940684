BACKGROUND: Recently, Acinetobacter emerged as an important pathogen and the prevalence of isolation has increased since the last two decades worldwide. AIMS: To determine Acinetobacter incidence, their clinical demography, antibiotyping and speciation. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A study of the clinical samples submitted to microbiology laboratory of a teaching hospital over a period of 3 years (December 1994 through November 1997). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Identification, speciation and antibiotyping were performed for the isolates of Acinetobacter recovered from infective samples. Clinical demographic characteristics were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: Total 510 of 5391 (9.6%) of isolates were Acinetobacter, responsible for 71.2% (363 of 510) monomicrobial and 28.8% (147 of 510) polymicrobial infections. The organism was responsible for 156 (30.6%) cases of urinary tract infection and 140 (27.5%) cases of wound infection and was most prevalent in the intensive care unit (30.8%, 140 of 455). The crude mortality rate due to multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter septicemia was 7.9% (36 of 455). The isolates could be classified into 7 species, with A. baumannii being most predominant. No peculiar pattern during antibiotyping was observed, but most of them were multi-drug resistant. CONCLUSION: Multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter nosocomial infection has emerged as an increasing problem in intensive care units of the hospital, responsible for 7.9% deaths. The analysis of risk factors and susceptibility pattern will be useful in understanding epidemiology of this organism in a hospital setup.
