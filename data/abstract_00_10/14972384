Continuing emergence of new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and the increased frequency of existing resistances, requires the development of alternative antimicrobial agents. Dalbavancin is an amide glycopeptide derivative with a markedly extended serum elimination half-life. Dalbavancin and selected comparators were tested against 6,339 recent clinical isolates (2002) from the Americas and Europe using reference susceptibility testing methods. The general characteristics of this Gram-positive organism collection were: oxacillin (OXA)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA) at 39% of strains; vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) at 10%; and penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci at 28%. The overall distribution of dalbavancin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from < or = 0.015 to > 32 microg/ml, but > 99% of MIC results were at < or =1 microg/ml. S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were extremely susceptible to dalbavancin (MIC90, 0.06 microg/ml) despite resistance patterns to other agents. Dalbavancin was the most potent compound (by weight) against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium (MIC90, 0.06 and 0.12 microg/ml, respectively); however, VRE strains showed decreased dalbavancin susceptibility (MIC50, 4 or 8 microg/ml). All streptococcal isolates were inhibited at < or =0.25 microg/ml of dalbavancin. This reported dalbavancin activity indicates that the new glycopeptide has significant activity, superior to available agents in the class, and a potency that was uniform across geographically sampled organisms. Some VRE were inhibited by very low dalbavancin concentrations (< or = 1 microg/ml; Van B phenotypes). Further clinical development seems warranted for this once-weekly administered agent.
