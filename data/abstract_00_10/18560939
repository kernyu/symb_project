Four bacterial strains were isolated from soils at nickel-contaminated sites based on their ability to utilize 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) as a sole source of nitrogen. The four isolates were all identified as Pseudomonas putida Biovar B, and subsequent testing revealed that they all exhibited traits previously associated with plant growth promotion (i.e., indoleacetic acid and siderophore production and ACC deaminase activity). These four strains were also tolerant of nickel concentrations of up to 13.2 mM in the culture medium. The strain, HS-2, selected for further characterization, was used in pot experiments to inoculate both nontransformed and transgenic canola plants (expressing a bacterial ACC deaminase gene in its roots). Plants inoculated with the HS-2 strain produced an increase in plant biomass as well as in nickel (Ni) uptake by shoots and roots. The results suggest that this strain is a potential candidate to be used as an inoculant in both phytoremediation protocols and in plant growth promotion.
