The quinolone resistance determining regions of gyrA and parC in four species of enterococci from environmental samples with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were sequenced. The nucleotide sequence variations of parC could be related to the different enterococcal species. Mutations in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium related to reduced susceptibility were identical to mutations detected in E. faecalis and E. faecium of clinical origin. A minimal inhibitory concentration of 8 microg ml(-1) to ciprofloxacin was not associated with any mutations in the gyrA and parC gene of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum. These two species may be intrinsically less susceptible to ciprofloxacin.
