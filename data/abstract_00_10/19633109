Sulfonamide-resistant Escherichia coli and Salmonella isolates from pigs and chickens in Ontario and Quebec were screened for sul1, sul2, and sul3 by PCR. Each sul gene was distributed differently across populations, with a significant difference between distribution in commensal E. coli and Salmonella isolates and sul3 restricted mainly to porcine E. coli isolates.
