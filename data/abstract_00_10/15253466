Combination therapy has been recommended to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections worldwide. The purpose of the present study was to determine the in vitro activities of piperacillin, cefepime, aztreonam, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin alone and in combination against 100 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa from one medical center in southern Taiwan. The combination susceptibility assay was performed using the checkerboard technique. The percentage of resistance of P. aeruginosa to single agents in our study was relatively high for the Asia-Pacific area, except to aztreonam. Piperacillin plus amikacin exhibited the highest potential for synergy (59/100) in this study. Moreover, a high percentage of synergism was also noted with amikacin combined with cefepime (7/100) or aztreonam (16/100). The combination of two beta-lactams, such as cefepime with piperacillin, and aztreonam with cefepime or piperacillin, showed synergistic effects against some P. aeruginosa isolates. Although ciprofloxacin is a good anti-pseudomonal agent, a very low potential for synergy with other antibiotics was demonstrated in this study. No antagonism was exhibited by any combination in our study. Among piperacillin-resistant strains, there was synergy with a beta-lactam plus amikacin, including the combination of piperacillin and amikacin. However, the combination of two beta-lactams, such as piperacillin and cefepime or aztreonam, did not have any synergistic activity against these strains. In summary, the combinations of amikacin with the tested beta-lactams (piperacillin, aztreonam, cefepime) had a greater synergistic effect against P. aeruginosa, even piperacillin-resistant strains, than other combinations. Understanding the synergistic effect on clinical strains may help clinicians choose better empirical therapy in an area with high prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa.
