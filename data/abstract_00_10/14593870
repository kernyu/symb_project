The strain of Aspergillus niger ZBY-7 was selected as the original strain of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase production. After mutagenesis of the strain using UV irradiation and nitrosoguanidine, mutants of Aspergillus niger resistant to certain metabolic inhibitor were obtained. Five of the mutants showed increased glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase production. The mutant resistant to antimycin A (Aspergillus niger AM-23) produced the highest level of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (695.9% of that from the original strain).
