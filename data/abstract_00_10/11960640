To analyze the role of the Th2 cytokine interleukin-5 (IL-5) in experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) pathogenesis, we induced clinical EAMG in C57BL/6 and IL-5 gene-knockout (KO) mice in the C57BL/6 background. IL-5 KO mice had a significantly reduced incidence and severity of EAMG. Despite their increased resistance to EAMG, IL-5 KO mice displayed intact secondary antibody and lymphoproliferative responses to acetylcholine receptor (AChR) after immunization with this molecule. However, the relative resistance of IL-5 KO mice was associated with a reduced primary lymphocyte response to AChR, and reduced C3 levels in muscle extracts compared to those in C57BL/6 mice.
