B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) remains an incurable disease that requires innovative new approaches to improve therapeutic outcome. Honokiol is a natural product known to possess potent antineoplastic and antiangiogenic properties. We examined whether honokiol can overcome apoptotic resistance in primary tumor cells derived from B-CLL patients. Honokiol induced caspase-dependent cell death in all of the B-CLL cells examined and was more toxic toward B-CLL cells than to normal mononuclear cells, suggesting greater susceptibility of the malignant cells. Honokiol-induced apoptosis was characterized by the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9 and cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Exposure of B-CLL cells to honokiol resulted in up-regulation of Bcl2-associated protein (Bax) and down-regulation of the expression of the key survival protein myeloid-cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), which is associated with response to treatment in B-CLL patients. In addition, B-CLL cells pretreated with interleukin-4 (IL-4), a cytokine known to support B-CLL survival, underwent apoptosis when subsequently incubated with honokiol, indicating that honokiol could also overcome the prosurvival effects of IL-4. Furthermore, honokiol enhanced cytotoxicity induced by fludarabine, cladribine, or chlorambucil. These data indicate that honokiol is a potent inducer of apoptosis in B-CLL cells and should be examined for further clinical application either as a single agent or in combination with other anticancer agents.
