In this research we evaluated the antibacterial activity of water soluble green tea extracts on 43 hospital isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A total of 43 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected from clinical specimens at two hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The susceptibilities of isolates to different antibiotics were tested using agar disk diffusion method. Antibacterial activity of water soluble green tea extract was measured by Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBCs). 35.6% of isolated strains showed resistance to 5 antibiotics or more and 55.8% of all strains were Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) strains. The average MICs and MBCs of the extract against all strains of Pseudomonas auroginosa were 2.06 +/- 1.76 and 2.54 +/- 2.22 mg mL(-1) respectively.Our study suggests that green tea has significant activity with bactericidal action on multi-drug resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
