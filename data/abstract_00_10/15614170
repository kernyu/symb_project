OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of nasal carriage of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) on antibiotic cost, infection morbidity, mortality and length of stay in a geriatric population. METHODS: 341 consecutive elderly patients (mean age 83.4 +/- 8.7 years) admitted to an intermediate care facility were prospectively include between November 1998 and October 1999. Nasal swab cultures were taken on admission. RESULTS: In sixty patients (17.6%) no nasal swab was taken. Among the 281 patients screened, 52 were identified as MRSA carriers. The principle predictive factors were: diabetes (p=0,046), sores (p=0,03), malnutrition (p=0,02), polypathology (p=0,02) and prolongation of previous hospitalisation (p=0,09). CONCLUSION: Nasal carriage of MRSA on admission to the facility was not a deleterious prognostic factor regarding duration of stay, infectious morbidity and antibiotic cost, but was associated with higher mortality risk.
