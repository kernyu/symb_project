The activity against Gram-positive bacteria of 3,4,5,3',5'-pentabromo-2-(2'-hydroxybenzoyl)pyrrole I, a synthetic anti-bacterial compound related to pyrrolomycins, was tested in vitro using seven reference bacterial strains and Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus preformed biofilms. Compound I was active against all strains tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.002 to 0.097 mg/l and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) from 0.37 to 12.5 mg/l. Compound I was also active at low concentrations against preformed S. epidermidis and S. aureus biofilms.
