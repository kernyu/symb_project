The Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) K76T mutation and haplotype (amino acids 72-76) were analyzed as markers of chloroquine (CQ) resistance in the blood samples of patients from two sites of different intensities of malaria transmission (high, n=70; low, n=68) in Sundergarh district of Orissa, India and correlated with the in-vivo response. Early treatment failure (ETF) was significantly more frequent in the high endemic area (32.9 vs. 7.4%, P<0.001), with children below 5 years suffering more. A high frequency of pfcrt K76T mutation was observed in both the areas (87.1 vs. 79.4%, P=0.22). Patients carrying pfcrt 76T were the most likely to develop ETF (odds ratio 36; 95% CI 3.35-1653.3; P<0.001). The ratio of 76T:K76 was 22:9 and 11:14, respectively, in high and low endemic areas (odds ratio 3.1; 95% CI 0.9-11.03; P=0.04), which may be used as a measure of drug pressure. Sequences of pfcrt codons 72-76 showed 16 of the CQ-resistant haplotypes to be SVMNT, 5 CVMNT and 12 CVIET. The CQ-sensitive haplotypes were mostly CVMNK in 10 samples; CVIEK in 2 samples. Both Southeast Asian and South American haplotypes were present, with the latter predominating.
