Infection is a common problem in dialysis patients and ranks second behind cardiovascular disease as a major cause of death. The major causes of infections, mainly bloodstream infections, often are related to dialysis access. Metastatic infectious complications have been reported frequently in the course of such bacteremias. We report the case of a 79-year-old dialysis patient who was admitted with recurrent catheter-related bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Echocardiography and a computed tomographic scan of her chest showed multiple coronary artery bypass graft mycotic aneurysms. Despite prompt dialysis catheter removal and antibiotic treatment, she had progressive deterioration of her hemodynamic and mental status and eventually died of profound sepsis. An autopsy confirmed computed tomographic findings, plus extensive suppuration involving the left atrial and ventricular myocardium and upper lobe of the left lung. To our knowledge, this is the first report of coronary artery graft aneurysms complicating infective endocarditis in a dialysis patient.
