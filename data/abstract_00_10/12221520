We investigated the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) to assess whether this acid may also have "protective" effects similar to those found with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). We used a well-known amphibian model of gastric mucosa, and studied the effects of taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) on electrical transepithelial parameters, acid secretion and histology in absence or in presence of TUDCA. Mucosal exposure to TDCA, after stimulation with histamine, caused a reduction in transepithelial potential difference (V(t)) and transepithelial resistance (R(t)) and a decrease in acid secretion while mucosal exposure to TUDCA did not cause a significant change in the electrical parameters. Moreover, TDCA primarily affected the neck cells, while TUDCA affected only oxyntic cells, causing a similar degree of injury to that observed in controls. Mucosal exposure to TUDCA plus TDCA caused a reduction in short circuit current (I(sc)) and R(t), whereas acid secretion did not change. These results suggest that: (1) TUDCA reduces the damaging effects of TDCA on fundus gastric mucosa; (2) TUDCA may play an important role in the treatment of gastritis associated with bile reflux.
