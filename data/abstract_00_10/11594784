It has been proposed that ceramide mediates anthracyclin-induced apoptosis and that drug resistance may arise due to upregulated removal of this active lipid through glucosylation. We report that HepG2 hepatoma cells displayed only a modest apoptotic response to doxorubicin treatment, accompanied by a substantial elevation of ceramide levels only at toxic drug concentrations. D,L-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) and D,L-threo-1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (PPPP), used at concentrations causing a 90% inhibition of ceramide glucosylation, enhanced doxorubicin-elicited ceramide elevation, but only PDMP potentiated apoptosis. Exogenously administered ceramide had only a marginal apoptotic effect on HepG2 cells; moreover, even in this case, apoptosis was propagated by PDMP but not by PPPP. PDMP moderately inhibited P-glycoprotein activity only at the highest concentration tested, but its chemosensitizing effect was still outstanding at lower concentrations, at which P-gp inhibition was no longer observed. These results demonstrate that the chemosensitizing effect of PDMP is, at least partly, independent from its activity as a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor. Moreover, P-glycoprotein inhibition is not central to the phenomenon.
