The in vitro potency of GMP-grade stampidine (CAS 217178-62-6) was examined against 3 clinical HIV-1 isolates and 6 recombinant HIV-1 clones with multi-NRTI 'resistance (NRTI: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors). GMP-grade stampidine active drug substance (Lot #'s MPR-M0008.00-01 and MPR-M0008.01-01) as well as GMP-grade stampidine extracted from the clinical stampidine capsules (GMP-Grade Clinical Batch, Pharmaceutical Service Lot Number 159I0601) were highly potent and exhibited nanomolar IC50 values against clinical HIV-1 isolates as well as recombinant HIV-1 clones with multi-NRTI resistance containing common patterns of reverse transcriptase mutations responsible for NRTI resistance.
