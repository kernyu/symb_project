The aim of this study was to perform the molecular characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MRSH) from clinical specimens of patients in a Chinese hospital. One hundred and thirty-three strains of S. haemolyticus collected from April 2002 to April 2003 were analyzed. Antimicrobial susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents was determined by the broth microdilution method. The resistant rates to penicillin G and oxacillin were higher than 90%. There were no isolates resistant to linezolid or vancomycin, and only 6.0% of the strains were resistant to teicoplanin. The positivity rate for mecA genes was 90.2% by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ninety MRSH (isolated from inpatients and mecA-gene-positive) were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after SmaI digestion. Twenty-five different PFGE patterns (A approximately Y) were found and a major clone (type A; n = 36) with five subtypes was identified. Clone A was detected during a 1-year period. Identical PFGE types were found in different wards and patients. The results of this study suggest the clonal spread of MRSH within our hospital. This emphasizes the need for control and prevention measures.
