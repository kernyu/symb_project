Trichosporon spp. is not an important factor of mycotic infections in immunocompetent patients. It may be a cause of invasive mycoses with a high mortality rate in patients undergoing solid organ transplantation. We have analysed the antifungal agents' susceptibility of Trichosporon asahii and its frequency of occurrence as a prospective etiological agent of infections in liver, kidney and simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant recipients. Clinical specimens (urine, blood, peritoneal fluid and swabs) were obtained from patients hospitalised in the Institute of Transplantation Medicine, Department of General and Transplantation Surgery, Medical University of Warsaw in 2005 and 2006. Microbiological tests were performed in Mycological Laboratory, Department of Microbiology, Medical University of Warsaw. A total of 475 strains of yeast-like fungi were isolated from clinical specimens taken from 263 liver, kidney and simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant recipients and from 26 organ donors. Trichosporon asahii was found in 26 clinical samples taken from 18 patients and one organ donor. Positive cultures were obtained from 22 urine samples, one stoma fluid, one wound swab, one tracheal aspirate and one ejaculate. Isolates of Trichosporon asahii were found in 6% of total positive mycological cultures in the solid organ transplant recipients. Among cultured strains, 11 isolates were resistant to fluconazole, four to itraconazole and three of them demonstrated resistance to amphotericin B.
