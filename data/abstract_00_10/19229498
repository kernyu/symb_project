Vibrio cholerae isolates recovered from cholera outbreaks in Bhind district of Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, Northern India were characterized. The O1 serogroup isolates from Bhind outbreak were of Inaba serotype whereas both Ogawa and Inaba serotypes were recovered from Delhi. PCR analysis revealed that only O1 serogroup V. cholerae isolates carried the virulence-associated genes like ctxA, tcpA, ace, and zot. Molecular typing by repetitive sequence based ERIC, VCR1, and VC1 PCR's revealed similar DNA profile for both Inaba and Ogawa serotypes. A discrete VC1-PCR band identified among the El Tor strains had greater similarity (>97%) to the V. cholerae genome sequence and therefore has the potential to be used as a marker for the identification of the V. cholerae strains. Non-O1 strains recovered from Bhind region differed among themselves as well as from that of the O1 isolates. All the O1 serogroup isolates possessed SXT element and were uniformly resistant to the antibiotics nalidixic acid, polymyxin-B, furazolidone, cloxacilin, trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole, and vibriostatic agent 0129. Inaba strains from both Delhi and Bhind differed from Ogawa strains by their resistance to streptomycin despite sharing similar DNA patterns in all the three rep-PCRs. Though Delhi and Bhind are separate geographical regions in Northern India, Inaba strains from both these places appear to be closely related owing to their similarity in antibiogram and genetic profile.
