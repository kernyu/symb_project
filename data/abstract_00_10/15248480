Chinese hamster V79 cells were repeatedly exposed to a low dose of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) over several weeks and then exposed to H2O2, cisplatin or ultraviolet (UV) light. Cell killing was examined by colony formation, following these treatments. It was seen that cells conditioned by multiple low doses of H2O2 showed resistance to killing in case of H2O2 and cisplatin but the sensitivity to UV light was same as the control cells. Apoptosis was also determined in these cells after the same treatments. UV light failed to induce apoptosis in both conditioned and in control cells, but in case of cells treated with H2O2 and with cisplatin, there was less apoptosis in the conditioned cells compared to the control cells. From our observation we can say that the enhanced survival of cells after treatment with H2O2 or cisplatin could be due to inhibition of apoptosis.
