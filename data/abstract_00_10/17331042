We present here the first data available on resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in India. In these subtype C isolates, we have observed most of the mutations noted in reverse transcriptase (RT) for subtype B with some additional substitutions (at positions 98, 203, 208, and 221) that will warrant attention in the algorithms used.
