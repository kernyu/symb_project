Supercritical CO2 selectively extracted a series of 4-alkyl and 4-phenyl 5,7-dihydroxycoumarins from Mesua ferrea blossoms. Chemical modifications of the isolated compounds allowed us to confirm the structures elucidated by spectroscopic means and to prepare new derivatives amenable to SAR studies and potential pharmaceutical development. Biological investigations towards the screening on a number of bacteria strains and Plasmodium falciparum, identified compounds 1-9 as weak antiprotozoal agents and potent antibacterials on resistant Gram-positive strains.
