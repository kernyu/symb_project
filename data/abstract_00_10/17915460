The study of drug resistance (DR) trends in the Republic of Karelia (2000-2005) indicated an increase in the incidence of multidrug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. Among the contingents of patients, there was a particularly considerable increase in MDR tuberculosis from 18.4 to 57.6%. Analysis of the DR spectrum showed that the rate of DR to a combination of three first-line drugs was 65.3% in 2005. Retrospective analysis of 67 case histories of MDR tuberculosis revealed that in 23 (34%) patients the cause of multidrug resistance was a DR rise during therapy (amplification). Thus, one of the most important causes of an increase in the incidence of MDR tuberculosis among the contingents is a wide spread of multidrug resistance (to 3 drugs or more - 65.3%) during which the use of chemotherapy IIA (2S, H, R, Z, E + 1H, R, Z, E) results in the amplification of DR and the development of multidrug resistance among the contingents.
