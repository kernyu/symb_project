Novel 2-aminotetralin derivatives were synthesized as antifungal agents. The 2-aminotetralin scaffold was chemically designed to mimic the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring of the lead molecule described before. Their antifungal activities were evaluated in vitro by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Compounds 10a, 12a, 12c, 13b, and 13d are more potent than fluconazole against seven testing human fungal pathogens. Compound 10b exhibits much higher antifungal activities against all of the four fluconazole-resistant clinic Candida albicans strains than the control drugs including amphotericin B, terbinafine, ketoconazole, and itraconazole. The mode of action of some compounds to the potential receptor lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase (CYP51) was investigated by molecular docking. The studies presented here provide a new structural type for the development of novel antifungal compounds. Furthermore, 10b was evaluated in vivo by a rat vaginal candidiasis model, and it was found that 10b significantly decreases the number of fungal colony counts.
