Three clinical trials with fecal egg count reduction tests and coproculture were conducted on 2 standardbred farms in Ontario. On Farm A, the treatment groups were mebendazole and ivermectin in trial 1, and fenbendazole and moxidectin in another. On Farm B, treatment groups were mebendazole and ivermectin. All horses treated with mebendazole or fenbendazole were subsequently treated with ivermectin or moxidectin. Strongyle eggs/g feces were estimated pre- and post-treatment using the Cornell-McMaster dilution and Cornell-Wisconsin centrifugal flotation techniques. After treatment, there was no change in the arithmetic mean eggs/g feces for horses given mebendazole, and a reduction of only 49.1% for those given fenbendazole. All horses receiving ivermectin or moxidectin had their egg counts reduced to 0. Only cyathostomes were found on culture. On both farms the benzimidazole resistant strains appeared to have persisted for at least 10 years. Development of and monitoring for anthelmintic resistance are briefly discussed.
