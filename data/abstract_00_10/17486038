The main risk of anti-infectious drugs is the selection of resistant microorganisms that might be a threat for the human community. It requires a justified prescription of every antibiotic and antiseptic product, including the topicals such as eye drops. The risk of toxicity is less important because it is well known, it is obvious when it occurs, and because it is an individual and nontransmissible risk.
