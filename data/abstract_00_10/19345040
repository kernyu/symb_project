The impact of accessory gene regulator (agr) dysfunction and high bacterial density on vancomycin killing and resistance was evaluated among 10 clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream isolates using time kill experiments. Under conditions of high inocula and agr dysfunction, vancomycin activity was markedly attenuated, amplifying resistant mutants by 72 h.
