The combination of flucytosine and amphotericin B was tested against 10 flucytosine-resistant isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans by checkerboard, killing curves, and Etest. Although differences were observed depending on the technique used, antagonism was never observed. The synergistic interaction was related to the mechanism of flucytosine resistance of the isolates.
