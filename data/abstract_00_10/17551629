In a time of emerging bacterial resistance there is a vital need for new targets and strategies in antibacterial therapy. Using uropathogenic Escherichia coli as a model pathogen we have developed a class of compounds, pilicides, which inhibit the formation of virulence-associated organelles termed pili. The pilicides interfere with a highly conserved bacterial assembly and secretion system called the chaperone-usher pathway, which is abundant in a vast number of Gram-negative pathogens and serves to assemble multi-protein surface fibers (pili/fimbriae). This class of compounds provides a platform to gain insight into important biological processes such as the molecular mechanisms of the chaperone-usher pathway and the sophisticated function of pili. Pili are primarily involved in bacterial adhesion, invasion and persistence to host defenses. On this basis, pilicides can aid the development of new antibacterial agents.
