AIM: To identify and evaluate dentists' knowledge of and prescription patterns of antimicrobial drugs. PARTICIPANTS: All 80 registered general dental practitioners in the Republic of The Fiji Islands, excluding academic staff at Fiji School of Medicine. Sixty five (81%) usable replies were received and analysed. RESULTS: Daily prescription of antibiotics increased with years in practice. There was a moderate level of knowledge regarding specific indications for antibiotic prescription both therapeutically and prophylactically. There was a tendency towards over-prescription with lower dosage, broad spectrum antibiotics with amoxycillin being the overwhelming choice. Some under prescription was noted in certain surgical scenarios. There was a lack of knowledge of the incidence of adverse reactions and very poor medical history record taking. Approximately one third of respondents felt antibacterial resistance is a problem in Fiji and 40% reported experiencing some form of antibiotic resistance in clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Overall there was a moderate level of correct knowledge for antibiotic prescribing of dentists in Fiji. An improved section on oral and dental infections including guidelines for children should be included in the Fiji Antibiotic Guidelines which could be distributed to all dentists.
