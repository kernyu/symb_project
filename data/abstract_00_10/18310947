A series of 3-sulfenylazetidine derivatives 5a-f were synthesized via the ring-opening reactions of 1-azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB, 3) with thiols 4a-f in 50-92% yields. Treatment of ABB (3) with aromatic amines 9a-e and dibenzylamine (9f) in the presence of Mg(ClO4)2 afforded the corresponding 3-aminoazetidine derivatives 10a-f in 24-65% yields. N-Benzyl-3-bromoazetidine (13), which was obtained by the reaction of ABB (3) with benzyl bromide, gave 3-aliphatic amino-substituted azetidine derivatives 15a, b. Novel fluoroquinolones 7a-f, 11a-f, 16a, b and 25a-c were obtained by the introduction of these azetidine derivatives into the C7 position of a quinolone nucleus 6 and N1-heterocyclic quinolones 21a-c in 21-83% yields. Some of them exhibited a greater antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in comparison with that of clinically used fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin (LVFX).
