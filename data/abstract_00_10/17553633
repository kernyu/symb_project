The antibacterial activity of methanol extracts of ten moss species and fractions prepared from 80% methanol extract of Hylocomium splendens were evaluated by disk diffusion method. Nine moss species showed antibacterial activity against Gram (+) bacteria, in particular H. splendens and its ethyl acetate fractions showed stronger activity. Enhancement of antibacterial activity against Staphylococci by UV-A light irradiation was demonstrated in the extracts of Bartramia pomiformis, Ceratodon purpureus and Neckera douglasii.
