The long history of the use of Artemisia annua L. to treat malaria (called Quinghao in China and Thanh hao in Vietnam) has led Vietnamese scientists to manufacture locally preparations of artemisinine and artesunate, to test their tolerance for human beings as well as their efficiency in treating P. falciparum and P. vivax infections. Associating these drugs with antibiotics (such as tetracycline or doxycycline) could be an interesting topic for future research. Under the auspices of the National Program against Malaria, specialists will try to prevent the occurrence of drug resistance in Plasmodium and to propose new associations of drugs.
