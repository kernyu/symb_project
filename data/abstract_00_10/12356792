The performance of the Etest and agar dilution for in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of Campylobacter spp. was evaluated using a quality control strain Campylobactor jejuni ATCC 33560, and 81 C. jejuni and 54 Campylobacter coli isolates recovered from retail raw meats. Seven antimicrobial agents: chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline, were tested using the two methods, whereas azithromycin was tested using the Etest only. The correlation between the Etest and agar dilution MICs varied greatly depending on the antimicrobial agents tested. The overall agreement of MICs (+/-1 log(2) dilution) between the two methods was 61.9%, ranging from 21.4% for nalidixic acid to 92.6% for gentamicin. MICs obtained using the Etest were generally lower than those by agar dilution regardless of the species of organism tested. MIC(50) and/or MIC(90) values were at least one dilution lower for the Etest than for agar dilution when testing chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, erythromycin and nalidixic acid. Based on the agar dilution MICs, the resistant rate of the 135 Campylobacter isolates was highest for tetracycline (82.2%), followed by doxycycline (78.5%), nalidixic acid (21.5%), ciprofloxacin (20.7%) and erythromycin (17.0%). None of the isolates demonstrated resistance to chloramphenicol or gentamicin. The study indicated that the Etest results were not in complete agreement with the agar dilution test. Although the Etest has been proven to be a satisfactory testing method, its use for Campylobacter susceptibility testing requires further standardization. The study also showed that C. jejuni and C. coli isolates resistant to antimicrobials used for treating campylobacteriosis were common in retail raw meats.
