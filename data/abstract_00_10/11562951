The presence of the lamivudine-associated M184V RT mutation increases tenofovir susceptibility in multiple HIV genotypes. Tenofovir is uniquely active against multinucleoside-resistant HIV expressing the Q151M mutation, but shows reduced susceptibility to the T69S insertion mutations. HIV with common forms of zidovudine and lamivudine resistance are susceptible to tenofovir, corroborating phase II clinical results demonstrating the activity of tenofovir DF in treatment-experienced patients.
