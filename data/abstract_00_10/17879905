In this brief report, we describe a 23-year-old immunocompetent Nigerian patient with extensive multifocal tuberculous spondylitis without disk involvement. Cultures of sputum samples and biopsy samples from the L4 vertebra were positive for tuberculosis; drug-susceptibility testing of the isolates revealed multidrug resistance. Treatment with second-line drugs resulted in an excellent interim outcome after 6 months, without the need for surgical intervention.
