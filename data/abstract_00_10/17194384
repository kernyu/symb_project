INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to compare the activity of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin and ofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by determining the mutant prevention concentration (MPC). METHODS: Thirty-four clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa causing nosocomial infection were studied. MPC values were determined using an inoculum of 10(10) cfu/mL on Mueller-Hinton plates with serial dilutions of the antibiotics. The microorganisms were classified according to whether the patients had been previously treated with fluoroquinolones or not. RESULTS: The fluoroquinolone with the lowest MPC values was ciprofloxacin, followed by levofloxacin. Analysis of strains from patients previously treated with fluoroquinolones showed persistent susceptibility according to the CLSI criteria, but with lower activity of all the drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Although the microorganism remained susceptible to fluoroquinolones according to classical methods, the suitability of using these drugs in patients with severe infection and a history of fluoroquinolone use should be evaluated.
