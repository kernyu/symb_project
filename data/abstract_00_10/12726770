Based on hybridization studies, 21/32 multi-resistant clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii contain class 1 integrons. Amplification products were obtained from 20 of the hybridization-positive strains. A single dfrA7 cassette was identified in 18 of the isolates and an integron with two cassettes (aadB-aadA4) was found in only one strain. Amplicons were not obtained from one of the hybridization positive strains. DNA sequence analysis of a 6.080-kb fragment, cloned from this strain, identified the remnant of an integron, following insertion of IS26 into the 5(')-end of intI1. The 6.080-kb sequence carries an aminoglycoside resistance gene, linked to a portion of IS1133, which in turn is linked to a sequence that has properties of IS elements, including sequences that could stimulate transcription, and ORFs encoding amino acid sequences with similarity to a transposase from Deinococcus radiodurans.
