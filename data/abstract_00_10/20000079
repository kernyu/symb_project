The study was undertaken to enhance the efficiency of surgical treatment for progressive drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis, by applying adjuvant lymphotropic chemotherapy (ALCT). Seventy-one patients were examined and operated on; of them 35 patients received ALCT and 36 patients formed a control group. The determinants of the efficiency of the performed treatment were the frequency of specific postoperative complications. ALCT used in combination with the conventional antituberculous treatments made it possible to enhance the efficiency of surgical treatment, by halving the number of postoperative complications, reducing the duration of a postoperative period, and enhancing the intensity of chemotherapy, by taking into account the data on the resistance of a pathogen, without causing adverse reactions, and to improve the psychoemotional status of patients.
