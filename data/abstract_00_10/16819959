Real-time quantification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was performed in various wastewater systems including clinical, municipal wastewaters and inflow from a wastewater treatment plant. The highest concentrations of P. aeruginosa-specific targets were detected in clinical wastewaters. Limitations of the detection system resulting from inhibition or cross-reaction were identified. Ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were isolated after specific enrichment from clinical and municipal wastewaters. In some cases they were also cultivated from effluent of a wastewater treatment plant, and from its downstream river water. A total of 119 isolates were phenotypically characterized as ciprofloxacin-resistant via antibiogram testing. Subsequently, the fluoroquinolone-resistance-mediating mutations in the genes gyrA codon positions 83 and 87, gyrB codon position 466 and parC codon positions 87 and 91 were determined by mini-sequencing. Ciprofloxacin resistance was mainly associated with mutations in gyrA codon position 83 and parC mutation in codon positions 87 or 91 of the bacterial gyrase and topoisomerase II genes. All ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were compared with genotypes from clinical data of fluoroquinolone-resistant P. aeruginosa infections. The results were in agreement with data from clinical analyses, with the exception that no gyrA 87 and no gyrB mutations were found in ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa wastewater isolates.
