BACKGROUND: The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, levofloxacin, gemifloxacin and moxifloxacin against 78 Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 31 Ureaplasma urealyticum strains, which were isolated from patients with urethritis in Istanbul, were determined and compared. Additionally, the activities of penicillin and ceftriaxone against N. gonorrhoeae strains were explored. METHODS: MICs were determined by agar and broth dilution methods for N. gonorrhoeae and U. urealyticum, respectively. RESULTS: The susceptibility rates for penicillin and tetracycline in N. gonorrhoeae strains were 35.9 and 24.3%, respectively. All gonococcal strains were susceptible to ceftriaxone, with very low MICs (MIC90 0.008 microg/ml). Telithromycin was highly active against N. gonorrhoeae and U. urealyticum strains (MIC90 0.25 microg/ml for both). Ciprofloxacin was the most active quinolone against N. gonorrhoeae (MIC90 0.008 microg/ml) while quinolone resistance was detected in a single strain (1.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Tetracycline and penicillin should not be the option in empirical treatment of N. gonorrhoeae infections due to the very low susceptibility rates. Ceftriaxone continues to be the first choice antibiotic in the treatment of gonococcal urethritis.
