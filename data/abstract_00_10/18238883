OBJECTIVES: To review antibiotic and antifungal policies in British and Irish neonatal units (NNUs). METHODS: A telephone survey was performed regarding empirical antimicrobial guidelines of NNUs in the UK and Republic of Ireland. RESULTS: The response rate was 91% (202 of 222 NNUs). The guidelines from all responding units covered group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli, the most common causes of neonatal septicaemia and meningitis. However, 19% did not cover Listeria, the cause of meningitis in 5% to 7% of cases in England and Wales. Second-line recommendations varied greatly between units, with widespread use of broad-spectrum agents. Fungal prophylaxis and treatment guidelines were generally rudimentary. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical antimicrobial recommendations on many NNUs include broad-spectrum antibiotics without ensuring universal coverage of important pathogens. We raise concerns about the selection pressures exerted for resistant pathogens and invasive fungal disease, especially as few units specify fungal prophylaxis or treatment guidance. Development of rational guidelines for the UK and Irish neonatal units might help to optimize treatment while minimizing overuse of broad-spectrum agents.
