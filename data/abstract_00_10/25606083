Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract pathogens has increased worldwide. The purpose of this study is to provide information regarding local resistance pattern of urinary pathogens to the commonly used antibiotics. One hundred and seventeen cases of community-acquired urinary tract infections were studied. The most common group of patients was the uncomplicated acute cystitis in women. E. coli was the most common isolate. Overall, antimicrobial susceptibility test on the organisms isolated showed a resistance of 63.0% to ampicillin, 40.1% to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (S-T), 14.3% to pipemidic acid, 8.6% to norfloxacin, 3.8% to cephalexin, 3.7% to amoxicillin-clavulanate, 1.0% to cefuroxime, and 1.0% to fosfomycin. Three out of five patients on ampicillin as well as two out of five patients on S-T were likely to be inadequately treated.
