Malaria ranks with tuberculosis and AIDS in terms of its ability to destroy human health. In India there are at least two million cases seen annually. Although mortality may not be as high as it is in Africa, the trauma due to morbidity and debility and loss of productive man hours are colossal. Since resistance to chloroquine and antifolates is spreading rapidly, there is need to develop new pharmacophores, for which identification of new drug targets is essential. This review focuses on targets arising from classical and unique metabolic pathways in the malaria parasite, highlighting the research being carried out in India in the context of the global scenario. A significant amount of research in India and elsewhere has provided new knowledge on parasite biology, that could pave the way for the development of new pharmacophores. However, it is a matter of regret to record that malaria being a poor man's disease does not enthuse pharmaceutical companies in general to invest and bring out new molecules. Developing countries like India should take a lead in developing new but affordable antimalarials.
