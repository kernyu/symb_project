It is highly recommended to conduct a prophylactic check for any dental problems on patients who suffer from leukaemia before chemotherapy begins. Bacteraemia caused by oral microflora may be very dangerous for patients with haematological malignancies. However, it should be noted that the prophylactic process itself might bring about life-threatening complications if there is only a short interval between dental treatment and the beginning of chemotherapy, or if the dental treatment is too aggressive. We present a case where this prophylactic procedure produced life-threatening complications for a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia.
