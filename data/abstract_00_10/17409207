We tested 214 Staphylococcus aureus isolates for the arcA locus of the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME). All USA300 SCCmec IVa isolates, but no isolates containing other SCCmec subtypes, were arcA positive. arcA was also detected in selected methicillin-susceptible USA300 and methicillin-resistant USA100 isolates. DNA sequence analysis confirmed the integration of ACME in orfX.
