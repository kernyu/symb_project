In this study the anti-leishmanial activity and anti-microtubule effects of paclitaxel, trifluralin and a combination of paclitaxel and trifluralin have been tested in a wild type and sodium arsenite-resistant strain of Leishmania donovani. Both paclitaxel and trifluralin have been shown to be effective in limiting parasite growth. Specific alterations in morphology, tubulin polymerization dynamics, post-translational modifications and cellular distribution of the tubulins have been confirmed to be a part of the intracellular anti-microtubule-events that occur in arsenite-resistant L. donovani in response to these agents, ultimately leading to death of the parasite. DNA analyses of the drug-treated wild type and arsenite-resistant strains revealed an apoptosis-like death in response to paclitaxel and the combination but not to trifluralin. Data provide valuable information for further development of chemotherapeutic strategies based on anti-microtubule agents against drug resistant Leishmania parasites.
