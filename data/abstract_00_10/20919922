We present an HIV-1-infected patient with a profile of transmitted drug resistance (RT M41L, E44D, V118I, L210W, T215D) sustained during more than 10 years in the absence of treatment. Clonal analysis of different plasma and cellular samples within this period did not reveal any reversion to the wild-type genotype.
