Quinine sulfate has been the drug of choice for the treatment of the ever-increasing number of cases of falciparum malaria in tropical countries. Because of the spectrum of adverse effects produced by the drug in the so-called cinchona syndrome, the variation in its pharmacokinetics during the episodes of falciparum malaria, and the different therapeutic regimens proposed in different countries, the authors monitored quinine plasma concentrations in daily samples of 20 men of the Amazon region in Brazil with nonsevere falciparum malaria who were administered 1 g quinine sulfate every 12 hours for 7 days. Three blood samples were collected from each patient each day: two immediately before administration of the drug (7 am and 7 pm) and one at 11 am. A total of 440 samples were analyzed by a validated method developed in the authors' laboratories using the high-performance liquid chromatographic technique. The overall quinine plasma levels obtained varied from 1.52 to 16.89 microg/mL. From the second day of treatment, overall levels varied from 2.33 to 14.29 microg/mL; the peak concentrations showed values from 4.22 to 16.89 microg/mL, showing the efficacy of the therapeutic regimen used. Adverse effects (signs and symptoms of cinchonism) were observed in all patients. However, no cases of hypoglycemia were detected. Intrapatient comparisons of the obtained quinine plasma concentrations were statistically significant. The quinine dose may be reduced on day 4 of treatment when asexual parasitemia is absent. This way, no resistance to the drug is observed, cinchonism can be minimized, and good adherence to the regimen is obtained.
