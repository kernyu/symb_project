BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Malaria is one of the major public health problems in the north eastern region of India. Antimalarial drug resistance is widespread and one of the important causes of recent resurgence of falciparum malaria in this region. Antimalarial drugs are seen to be used sequentially one after another in many areas of the region, when therapeutic failure is observed with a drug. In view of this, the present study was undertaken to assess the therapeutic efficacy of common antimalarial drugs viz., chloroquine, sulfadoxine+pyrimethamine (S-P) and quinine, administered sequentially to the patients with Plasmodium falciparum infection in a Myanmar bordering area of Arunachal Pradesh. METHODS: A hospital based in vivo study was carried out with 53 patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. All patients were first treated with chloroquine and therapeutic efficacy assessed. In case of therapeutic failure of chloroquine combination drug (S-P) was given and those showing failure with S-P combination, oral quinine was administered and followed up for 28 days to assess both clinical and parasitological responses. RESULTS: Therapeutic failure was observed with chloroquine in 83.1 per cent (44 of 53) and to both chloroquine and S-P combination drug in 44.1 per cent (19/43) patients. Further, 15.8 per cent patients (3 of 19) failed to respond even to quinine. Overall, 5.7 per cent patients (3 of 53) showed unresponsiveness to all the three drugs i.e., chloroquine, S-P combination and quinine. Asexual parasite clearance and also fever clearance was slowest with chloroquine and fastest with quinine. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show the presence of multi drug failure P. falciparum in Jairampur-Nampong, a western Myanmar bordering area of Arunachal Pradesh. Anti malarial drug resistance is increasing in Indo-Myanmar border areas and systematic studies need to be done to review the situation.
