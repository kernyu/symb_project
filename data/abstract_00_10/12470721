Twenty-seven novel cephalosporin derivatives with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are described. The compounds contain novel acid moieties at C-7 that were synthesized using nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions and Stille couplings. The most interesting compound (6) displayed an MIC(90) against MRSA of 3.7 microg/mL, and an average PD(50) of 3.9 mg/kg.
