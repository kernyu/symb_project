Thermoplasma acidophilum is sensitive to the antibiotic drug novobiocin, which inhibits DNA gyrase. We characterized DNA gyrases from T. acidophilum strains in vitro. The DNA gyrase from a novobiocin-resistant strain and an engineered mutant were less sensitive to novobiocin. The novobiocin-resistant gyrase genes might serve as T. acidophilum genetic markers.
