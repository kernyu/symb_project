Benzimidazole (BZ) resistance in Haemonchus contortus is linked primarily with the mutation in the beta-tubulin isotype 1 gene that substitute phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine (Tyr) at 200 codon of the gene. In the present study, a new restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) technique has been developed for detection of BZ resistance in the beta-tubulin isotype 1 gene of H. contortus. The technique utilizes two primers viz. AvikaF and AvikaR to amplify the region containing mutation in the beta-tubulin gene followed by restriction digestion. After digestion, the 'rr' individuals (homozygous resistant) revealed 257 and 48 bp bands, the 'rS' individuals (heterozygous) showed 305, 257 and 48 bp bands, while 'SS' individuals (homozygous susceptible) revealed uncut 305 bp band. A total of 162 adult male H. contortus collected from Avikanagar, Jaipur and Bikaner regions (54 from each region) were genotyped for analyzing BZ resistance in the beta-tubulin gene. Out of which, 130 adults were 'rr' types, 20 'rS' types and 12 'SS' types. The results showed that genotypic frequencies of different genotypes (rr, rS and SS) were highly significant difference among the three regions (P<0.001). The 'rr' individuals were higher (98%) in Jaipur followed by Avikanagar (93%) and Bikaner (50%) regions. Overall, the prevalence of BZ resistant allele (r) was higher (86%) as compared to BZ susceptible allele (S) (14%). The technique was also found suitable for genotyping of larvae of H. contortus and yielded reproducible results. The study indicated that RFLP-PCR is an easy, reproducible and less expensive than allele specific PCR. This technique will be helpful in establishing the prevalence rate of BZ resistance in H. contortus and can also be utilized for existing worm control programme.
