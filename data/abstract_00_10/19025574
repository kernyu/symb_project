The 8-oxodeoxyguanine (8-oxodG) repair system participates in the prevention and correction of mutations generated by oxidative DNA damage in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In this study, we report that Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains deficient in this repair mechanism by inactivation of the mutT, mutM and mutY genes generate a high frequency of cells resistant to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin. In the mutT strain, the increase in ciprofloxacin resistance achieved at threefold minimal inhibitory concentration was about 1600-fold over the wild-type (WT) level, similar to the frequency achieved by the mismatch repair-deficient mutS strain. Molecular analysis of WT, mutT and mutY clones resistant to ciprofloxacin indicated that the nfxB gene was mutated in the majority of the cases, while mutS-derived resistant clones were mainly mutated in gyrA and parC genes. Cell viability analysis after treatment with paraquat or hydrogen peroxide indicated that 8-oxodG repair-deficient strains were considerably more susceptible to oxidative stress than the parental strain. Finally, it is shown that the ciprofloxacin resistance frequency of WT and repair-deficient strains increased significantly after cell exposure to paraquat. Thus, oxidative stress is strongly implicated in the emergence of ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants in P. aeruginosa, and the 8-oxodG repair pathway plays an important role in the prevention of these mutations.
