Antimicrobial susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated at Kochi Municipal Central Hospital between 2001 and 2003 was assessed according to the NCCLS interpretive criteria. 1. The piperacillin-susceptible rate was 92.9%. 2. Among cephem antibiotics, the ceftazidime-susceptible rate was the highest (96.0%). 3. As for aminoglycosides, susceptibility to tobramycin and amikacin remained with a susceptible rate of 93.2% and 94.8%, respectively. 4. The carbapenem-susceptibility remained high. The susceptible rate for meropenem (94.1%) was higher than that for imipenem (88.3%). 5. Acquisition of resistance was observed in urinary isolates. Four multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa, which are resistant to all of imipenem, amikacin and ofloxacin were isolated in this study and all were isolated from urine. 6. Of 388 isolates, 34 isolates were resistant to imipenem, but no positive isolate was found in screening of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
