OBJECTIVE: This observational retrospective study aims to present early experience with tigecycline (TIG) in the treatment of infections due to multi-drug resistant (MDR) microorganisms. METHODS: Adult patients included, received TIG for >5 days either as monotherapy (M group) or as presumed active monotherapy (PAM group). In the PAM group, all co-administered antimicrobial(s) were resistant in vitro against the targeted pathogen(s) or had been clinically and microbiologically failing after >or=5 days of therapy despite in vitro susceptibility. RESULTS: Forty-five patients (35 in ICU) were treated for 28 Acinetobacter baumannii and 23 Klebsiella pneumoniae infections [21 ventilator-associated and healthcare-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HCAP), 10 bloodstream infections (BSI) and 14 surgical infections (SI)]. Successful overall clinical outcome was 80%, i.e. 81.8% in M group, 78.3% in PAM group, 90.5% in VAP/HCAP, 80% in BSI, 64.3% in SI and 85% in the cases with septic shock. Superinfections from Enterobacteriaceae inherently resistant to tigecycline occurred in 31.8% of M and 13% of PAM group (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: TIG represents a promising option in infections from MDR pathogens, however, further clinical experience is required.
