Prophylaxis with norfloxacin has been shown to be effective in preventing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in liver cirrhosis. This therapy is associated with the appearance of quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli. However, only four cases of SBP caused by quinolone-resistant E. coli have been reported so far. We present four cases of quinolone-resistant E. coli SBP in three patients receiving oral quinolones, and who were on corticosteroid therapy to treat associated disorders.
