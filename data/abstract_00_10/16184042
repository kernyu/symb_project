We evaluated the virological outcome of tenofovir plus didanosine-based regimens in 67 HIV-suppressed patients. After a median follow-up of 26 months (IQR 10.5-40.5), 12 (18%) discontinued the therapy because of virological failure. At virological failure 'de novo' selected mutations were identified in 11 of the 12 failing patients, including the K65R mutation in seven patients. These results argue against the use of tenofovir-didanosine not only in naive patients, but also in previously suppressed patients.
