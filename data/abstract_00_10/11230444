A cluster (14 of 18) of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 23F isolates that were resistant to penicillin (PEN), cephalosporin, and macrolide was found in one day care center in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. We analyzed the 18 isolates by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). All but one serotype 23F isolate demonstrated identical PFGE patterns, which were different from the established pattern of the internationally spread Spanish 23F clone. The three strains of serotype 19F also showed a uniform pattern. These data strongly suggest that two novel clones of PEN-, cephalosporin-, and macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae serotypes 23F and 19F are present in Taiwan.
