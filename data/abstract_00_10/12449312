Methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha were shown to cooperate with activated sludge from biological wastewater treatment stations, enhancing substantially its potential to biodegrade formaldehyde in industrial wastewater. After integration with yeast cells the modified sludge retained its original structure and activity whereas its resistance to elevated formaldehyde concentrations was significantly improved. The applicability of the yeast in the utilization of formaldehyde derivatives, as exemplified by urotropine and trioxane, was also investigated. The treatment of urotropine-containing wastewater with methylotrophic yeast was found to be effective at acidic conditions (pH below 5.5). Trioxane was not degraded due to the stability of an ether bond which made themolecule recalcitrant to oxidation via methylotrophic pathway reactions. It is concluded that the yeast species may be applied to treat wastewater containing formaldehyde and some of its derivatives as either monocultures or as an integrated, specialized element of the activated sludge biocenosis.
