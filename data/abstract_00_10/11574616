We describe a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonizing the pharynx. The MIC of mupirocin was 0.25 microg/ml before treatment and increased after treatment to 8 microg/ml. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, we confirmed that the genotypes of MRSA that colonized the pharynx before and after the use of mupirocin were identical. We measured the delivery of mupirocin to the pharynx in three normal volunteers and two patients. Low concentrations of mupirocin were present in the pharynx in all cases 10 min to 3 days after intranasal application. Our data suggested that low concentrations of the drug in the pharynx after intranasal application of mupirocin ointment might explain the selection of mupirocin resistance in MRSA.
