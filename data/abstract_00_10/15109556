The clinical efficacy of chloroquine was assessed in the Primary Health Centre of Ankazobe, Central Highlands of Madagascar. This study shows an increase in the level of chloroquine resistance with the appearance of early treatment failures and RIII resistance. Furthermore, the prevalence of clinical treatment failures is approaching the level of 25%, at which WHO recommends a change of first-line drug.
