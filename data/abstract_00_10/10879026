We analyzed the clinical and laboratory features of 37 adult patients with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Blood culture was positive in 11, and negative in 26. The average age of the 37 patients was 70.2 years, and 28 were male. Compared with the patients with negative blood culture, the patients with positive blood culture were more likely to have liver cirrhosis, less sputum production, lower body temperature, and higher respiratory rate on physical examination. In the laboratory data on admission, the values for serum total protein, albumin, and glucose were significantly lower in the patients with positive blood culture. Thirty-two percent of the pneumococcal isolates were resistant to penicillin G (MIC > or = 0.12 microgram/ml). There was no difference in the frequency of drug-resistant pneumococci in the two groups. The use of mechanical ventilation was more frequent in the patients with positive blood culture than in the patients with negative blood culture (27.3% vs 3.8%). Moreover, mortality was higher (27.3% vs 7.7%) and the duration of hospitalization was longer in the bacteremic group. However, from a univariate analytical perspective, these differences were not significant. We concluded that blood culture can be a highly valuable diagnostic aid and useful for the prognostic evaluation of patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization.
