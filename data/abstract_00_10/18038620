The effect of salicylic acid (SA) on oxalate oxidase and peroxidase activities and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in leaf cells has been studied in wheat of the susceptible cultivar Zhnitsa infected by the fungus Septoria nodorum, a pathogen of wheat leaf blotch. The results show that fungal hyphae spread into interstices between mesophyll cells and that infected tissues contain H2O2. Treatment with SA results in enhanced H2O2 production in mesophyll cells, which is due to activation of oxalate oxidase and peroxidase in the cell wall. It is proposed that the modulating effect of SA on oxide reductase activities is involved in the induction of protective response to fungal infection in wheat plants.
