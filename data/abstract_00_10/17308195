Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was isolated from the intestinal contents of Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus house rats captured at two buildings, designated buildings J and YS, in Yokohama City, Japan. From October 1997 to September 1998, 52 of 339 (15.3%) house rats were found to carry Salmonella serovar Typhimurium definitive phage type 104 (DT104). In building J, 26 of 161 (16.1%) house rats carried DT104 over the 1-year study period, compared to 26 of 178 (14.6%) rats in building YS. The isolation rates of DT104 from R. rattus and R. norvegicus were similar in the two buildings. Most DT104 strains from building J (24 of 26) showed resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline and contained both the 1.0- and 1.2-kbp integrons, carrying genes pse1, pasppflo-like, aadA2, sulI, and tet(G). All DT104 strains from building YS were resistant to ampicillin and sulfisoxazole, and had the 1.2-kbp integron carrying pse1 and sulI. Cluster analysis of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of BlnI-digested DT104 DNAs showed that 22 of 26 DT104 strains from building J and 24 of 26 strains from building YS could be grouped into separate clusters each specific for the building origin. These results indicated that DT104 strains were prevalent in house rat colonies in each building and suggest that house rats may play an important role in the epidemiology of DT104.
