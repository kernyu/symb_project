500 strains of Serratia marcescens isolated in 2003-2005 were examined for drug susceptibility. By using several phenotypic methods it was shown that 67.6% of these strains produced ESBLs. Strains ESBL(-) and ESBL(+) were compared, paying special attention to their susceptibility to various antibiotics. It was revealed that strains ESBL(+) were much more resistant to majority of the investigated drugs. The biggest differences were in the case of amikacin and gentamicin, sensitive about 50% of ESBL(-) and 10% of ESBL(+), ciprofloxacin, sensitive 42% of ESBL(-) and 6.3% of ESBL(+) and trimethoprim/ sulphametoxazole, sensitive 45.8% of ESBL(-) and 9.4% of ESBL(+). Strains ESBL(-) retained a high susceptibility to ceftazidime (68.9%) and cefepime (71%). All strains ESBL(-) as well as ESBL(+) were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. 78.9% of ESBL(-) and 67.3% of investigated ESBL(+) were susceptible to piperacillin/ tazobactam.
