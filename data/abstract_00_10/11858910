A patient case report describes an Enterococcus faecium strain isolated from a blood culture that was resistant to linezolid (MIC, 8 microg/mL; G2576U mutation of 23S rRNA). Co-resistances were identified for vancomycin, ampicillin, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, rifampin, gentamicin (high-level), nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) and disk diffusion results also detected the oxazolidinone resistance pattern. Laboratories should be aware of the rare possibility of these strains occurring during linezolid therapy or spontaneously (this case) in contemporary practice, and have in vitro susceptibility methods available capable of detecting oxazolidinone resistance.
