We found that a crude extract from Salvia officinalis (sage) reduced the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of aminoglycosides in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). We isolated the effective compound from the extract and identified it as carnosol, one of diterpenoids. Carnosol showed a weak antimicrobial activity, and greatly reduced the MICs of various aminoglycosides (potentiated the antimicrobial activity of aminoglycosides) and some other types of antimicrobial agents in VRE. Carnosic acid, a related compound, showed the similar activity. The effect of carnosol and carnosic acid with gentamicin was synergistic.
