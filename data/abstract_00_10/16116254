Candida spp. are recognized as a leading contributor to mortality and morbidity in patients with onco-hematological malignancies. The rates and risk factors for mycotic infections in pediatric oncology patients are undetermined, particularly for those treated at centers in developing countries. The objective of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the species stratification and antifungal susceptibility profile of Candida spp. associated with superficial and systemic infection in children with onco-hematological diseases. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was the most common underlying disease (71.4%) among the 91 children under study. Candida albicans was the predominant species, with 17/29 isolates (58.6%); followed by C. tropicalis, with 10/29 isolates (34.5%). The drug susceptibility data analysis for the clinical isolates of Candida revealed 17.2% (5/29) resistance to fluconazole. This study reinforces the need for the systematic surveillance of candidosis for the correct management of such life-threatening infections.
