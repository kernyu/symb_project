With more antibiotic resistance and emerging pathogens in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, the need for new strategies in the lifelong treatment of pulmonary infection has increased. Most of the focus is on chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is still thought to be the main pathogen leading to advanced CF lung disease. Other bacterial species are also recognized in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease, even though their definitive role is not well established yet. Clearly, expansion of treatment options is urgently needed. This article focuses on recent developments in the field of new antimicrobial strategies for CF. It is clear that studies on new classes of antibiotics or antimicrobial-like drugs are scarce, and that most studies involve new (inhalation) formulations, new routes of delivery, or analogs of existing classes of antibiotics. Studies of new antibiotic-like drugs are, in most cases, in preclinical phases of development and only a few of these agents may reach the market. Importantly, new inhaled antibiotics, e.g. aztreonam, levofloxacin, and fosfomycin, and new, more efficient delivery systems such as dry powder inhalation and liposomes for current antibiotics are in the clinical phase of development. These developments will be of great importance in improving effective treatment and reducing the treatment burden for CF patients in the near future.
