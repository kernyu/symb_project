A novel series of mutilin 14-carbamates has been discovered as a result of structure-activity studies on the naturally occurring antibiotic pleuromutilin (1). In particular, the 4-methoxybenzoylcarbamate, SB-222734 (15o) displays potent antibacterial activity against a number of bacterial pathogens which are resistant to currently used agents and shows enhanced metabolic stability when compared to earlier pleuromutilin derivatives. Such derivatives therefore have the potential to provide a new class of antibacterial agents for human therapy which address the threat of bacterial resistance.
