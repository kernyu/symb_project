Hospital resistant pathogens are a problem of hospital use allowing acquisition of multi-resistant strains. The use of antibiotics in the community and on the farm has little impact on hospital infection rates and prevalence of resistance in hospital bacteria. Once acquisition occurs the main problem is spread of clones to highly vulnerable patients. Attention to protective methods for such patients ought to be a priority in hospital infection control.
