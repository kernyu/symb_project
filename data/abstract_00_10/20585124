This study characterized a cephalosporin-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi isolate. The organism possessed a plasmid encoding the CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase. This plasmid is the determinant for the phenotype of cephalosporin resistance and is transferrable among Enterobacteriaceae.
