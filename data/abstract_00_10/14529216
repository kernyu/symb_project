UNLABELLED: As part of a larger project on childhood urinary tract infection, antimicrobial sensitivity tests were carried out on the bacterial isolates from the urine of febrile children seen at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODOLOGY: Midstream urine specimens were collected from 171 sickle cell anaemia children and from an equal number of haemoglobin-A controls and cultured by standard methods. Sensitivity to eleven antimicrobials was tested using the disc-diffusion technique of Stokes. RESULTS: Significant bacteriuria was obtained from 37 children with sickle cell anemia and 27 controls. The isolates were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Non-haemolytic streptococcus, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus, Salmonella, Proteus and Pseudomonas species. Sensitivity was highest to Pefloxacin to which over 94% of the organisms were sensitive followed by Ceftriaxone (over 85%) and ceftazidime (over 85%). Sensitivities to nalidixic acid and cefuroxime were between 67.6% and 74.1%. Most of the isolates were resistant to gentamicin, amoxycillin, cotrimoxazole and ampicillin. In general the sensitivity pattern in the sickle cell anaemia group was similar to the pattern in the control group. CONCLUSION: Aetiological agents of childhood UTI in this environment are resistant to most of the drugs commonly recommended for its treatment. Nalixidic acid and cefuroxime are recommended as first line drugs while awaiting results of sensitivity testing. Ceftriazone and ceftazidime should be reserved for cases of non-response to first line drugs and in severe cases. Pefloxacin should be considered potential drug of treatment particularly in multi-drug resistant infections.
