The prevalence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) mutations in the HIV protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes was estimated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a study population of 25 antiretroviral (ARV) therapy-naive and 50 ARV-experienced chronically infected patients from Pune city, Maharashtra State, western India. Of the 75 study HIV-1 sequences, 73 belonged to subtype C and 2 to subtype A1. On phylogenetic analysis, the study subtype C sequences sub clustered randomly with different Indian and non-Indian subtype C sequences, emphasizing the HIV-1 subtype C pol gene diversity. The heterosexual route was the most common route of transmission (74.67%). There were no observable HIVDR mutations in ARV-naive patients. The ARV-experienced patients had a history of exposure to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor combinations. At least one HIVDR mutation in RT was observed in 29 (80.55%) of ARV-experienced patients with evidence of failing therapy. M184V was the most common observed HIVDR mutation. No PR major mutations were observed among ARV-experienced patients. A higher prevalence of proviral HIVDR mutations in PBMCs was associated with irregular adherence to therapy (p < 0.05) and HIV-1 RNA levels > 1000 copies/ml (p < 0.001).
