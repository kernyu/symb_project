OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility, phage type and plasmid profile pattern of Salmonella enterica serotype paratyphi A strains isolated in Kuwait. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 1995 to December 1999, 106 strains of S. enterica serotype paratyphi A isolated from an equal number of cases of enteric fever, attending the Infectious Disease and Mubarak Al-Kabeer Hospitals in Kuwait were investigated. The isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to 8 commonly used antimicrobial agents. Their phage type and plasmid profile patterns were determined using an international set of phages and Qiagen plasmid mini kit, respectively. RESULTS: All of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin and co-trimoxazole. One hundred isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, 99 to chloramphenicol and 98 to tetracycline. None of the isolates was multidrug resistant. Sixty-six percent of the isolates were phage type I, 27.4% phage type II and 6.6% were untypable. All phage type I and untypable strains had 3 plasmids of 2.2, 5 and 20 kb, whereas phage type II strains had only 1 plasmid of 20 kb. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that while all of the isolates of the S. enterica serotype paratyphi A were susceptible to 4 of the drugs tested, some were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol or tetracycline, thereby indicating the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates.
