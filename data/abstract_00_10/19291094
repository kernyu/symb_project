Penner serotypes of C. jejuni in a total of 601 isolates from apparently healthy cattle, layer and broiler chickens in Japan were examined between 2001 and 2006. Predominant serotypes were B (O: 2, 19.1%), D (O: 4, 13.5%), Y (O: 37, 7.3%) and G (O: 8, 5.8%), whereas the remaining serotypes made up less than 5% of the total isolates. The frequency of ampicillin resistance in serotype G (65.6%) was significantly higher than in serotypes D (12.5%), B (11.2%), and Y (0%). Our results suggest that serotype is one factor contributing to the prevalence of ampicillin resistance in C. jejuni isolates.
