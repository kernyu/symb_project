Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), which manifests as an inflammation of at least one of the paranasal sinuses, is a major public health issue in developed countries. Diagnosis and treatment of ABRS can pose significant challenges in clinical practice, including difficulty in differentiation between viral and bacterial infection and a lack of simple, reliable and convenient methods for definitive diagnosis. Treatment choice is also a challenge because a decision is typically made empirically; therefore, the selection of therapy should be based on knowledge of local patterns of antimicrobial resistance, spectrum of activity against the most common ABRS pathogens (including those that are resistant to penicillins and macrolides) and pharmacodynamic potency. Current guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of ABRS in various countries share some similarities but also have important differences. Criteria for making the clinical diagnosis of sinusitis vary only slightly from country to country, while recommendations of therapy reflect the local impact of bacterial resistance.
