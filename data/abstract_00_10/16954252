A total of 125 non-penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were received at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in the period from 1995 to 2001. The strains were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, serotyped, and genotyped by multilocus sequence typing (MLST); and their penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) were typed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of their pbp genes. Of the 125 strains, 48 (38%) were fully resistant to penicillin and 77 (62%) were intermediately resistant to penicillin. Most of the strains resistant to penicillin were also resistant to one or several additional antibiotics. The most frequent serotypes among the non-penicillin-susceptible strains were 14, 9V, 19F, 23F, and 6B. MLST analysis showed a high degree of genetic diversity among the 119 strains tested, with a total of 74 different sequence types. Six of the 26 internationally known resistant clones were present; the Spain(9V)-3 clone was the most frequent, with 19 isolates. A total of 74 (62%) of the isolates were related to 1 of the 26 international clones. Restriction enzyme analyses of the pbp1a, pbp2b, and pbp2x genes revealed 12, 12, and 19 different patterns, respectively; and a total of 43 different PBPs types were demonstrated. Our data indicate that the non-penicillin-susceptible strains in Norway are highly diverse genetically and that limited spread of the internationally known resistant strains occurred in the country in the period examined.
