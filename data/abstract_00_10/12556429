The increase in antibiotic resistance and the possible changes in serotype prevalence as a consequence of a new conjugated vaccine have contributed to renewed interest in the study of pneumococcal serotypes and their antibiotic resistances. Spain still has one of the highest penicillin resistance rates, but in the past 4-5 years a slight decrease has been observed. The level of resistance has not increased either, 12.7% of the 11 165 isolates studied showed high-level penicillin resistance but 94% of these had an MIC of only 2 mg/L. Serotypes 6, 9, 14, 19 and 23 included 83% of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci; the remaining 17% belonged to 18 different serotypes. We analysed these minor penicillin-resistant serotypes in view of their potential increase following a possible child vaccination programme. Four of these serotypes (11, 15, 21 and 35) were the most prevalent, and among them serotype 15 was particularly frequent with >50% of its strains resistant. The effective control of these minor penicillin-resistant serotypes should be based on continuous surveillance of pneumococcal epidemiology.
