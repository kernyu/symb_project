Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is emerging as a significant healthcare-associated pathogen. Clinical cultures detect only a fraction of the colonized population, and patients with asymptomatic colonization are at risk of invasive infection. Additional study of the impact of detection of asymptomatic colonization on subsequent infection and transmission is needed.
