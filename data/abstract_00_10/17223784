Hydrogels of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) with 50 and 90% cross-linking degree (CMC50% and CMC90%, respectively) were prepared and loaded with bovine erythrocyte Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) to obtain two drug delivery systems: SOD-CMC50% and SOD-CMC90%. Resistance of native SOD to inactivation by H2O2 and the effect of applying SOD-CMC hydrogels to open wounds of rats' back skin were examined and compared to that of SOD trapped into CMC50% and CMC90% hydrogels. Also, the effect of CMC50% and SOD-CMC90% on human fibroblasts proliferation was evaluated at different times. It was found that SOD in the hydrogel was more resistant to H2O2 inactivation than the native enzyme and at the same time it reduced the time necessary for wound healing. Furthermore, the highest cell proliferation value was found for the CMC50% hydrogels, which had a three-dimensional structure suitable for gas and nutrient exchanges and improving cell life conditions.
