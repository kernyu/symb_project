Resistance to chloroquine (CQ) in Plasmodium falciparum is one of the main causes of the wide-spread resurgence of malaria in India and a challenge to the effective control of the disease. In the pilgrim centre of Rameswaram Island, malaria has persisted despite the various control measures undertaken over the years. When CQ resistance in Rameswaram was investigated in vivo, recrudescent parasitaemias were observed in 25 (58%) of the 43 study subjects who were given CQ and completed follow-up, all occurring between days 10 and 28 (late treatment failures). The results of the msp(1), msp(2) and glurp genotyping of paired samples of P. falciparum, collected on day 0 and the day of recrudescence from 23 of the apparent treatment failures, indicated that 21 (91%) of the 23 were probably true treatment failures. All of the paired samples harboured parasites with the K76T mutation in their pfcrt genes, and subsequent sequencing of nine day-0 samples revealed the SVMNT haplotype in all nine. This is the first report of in-vivo drug resistance in P. falciparum from Rameswaram Island. Such resistance, which is probably the result of the indiscriminate use of CQ and/or the import of malaria from mainland India, warrants a change in the drug regimen used locally for the first-line treatment of uncomplicated, P. falciparum malaria, to make treatment more effective and slow the development and spread of more foci of CQ resistance.
