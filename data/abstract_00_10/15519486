The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing organisms in an urban hospital in Dhaka City was assessed over a 10-month period. A double disk test was performed to detect ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. 43.2% and 39.5% of E. coli and K. pneumoniae had ESBL phenotypes, respectively. The combination of augmentin with ceftazidime detected the most ESBL-producing E. coli (39.5%) while augmentin with ceftriaxone was the best combination for the detection of ESBL (31.6%) in K. pneumoniae.
