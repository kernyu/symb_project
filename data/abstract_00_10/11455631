Adult mosquitoes from two strains of Anopheles gambiae and from three strains of Anopheles stephensi were exposed to 0.25% fipronil-treated papers in WHO test kits or to 500 mg fipronil m-2 impregnated mosquito netting in bioassay spheres. For comparison, tests were also carried out with the pyrethroid permethrin, using the same methods and doses, and on papers treated with 0.4 and 4% of the cyclodiene insecticide dieldrin. Compared with the same doses of permethrin, fipronil showed less and delayed activity. Two of the An stephensi strains were resistant to fipronil and dieldrin. To investigate whether this was due to a resistance mechanism in the An stephensi strains acting against both insecticides, the most fipronil- and dieldrin-tolerant strain was further selected in two separate lines with one of the insecticides, followed by tests with the insecticide that the line had not been selected with. This indicated a concomitant rise of resistance to dieldrin in the fipronil-selected line and vice versa. Repeated back-crossing of the two lines with a susceptible strain and re-selection with either dieldrin or fipronil gave evidence for the involvement of a single resistance mechanisms to both insecticides. Permethrin resistance in both lines declined with selection for dieldrin or fipronil and confirms the absence of cross-resistance between fipronil and pyrethroids.
