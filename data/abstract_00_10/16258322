PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review addresses therapeutic approaches to community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, focusing on recently published data in the English-language medical literature dating from June 2004 to July 2005. RECENT FINDINGS: During the reviewed time period, the overall understanding of the epidemiology and virulence of community-acquired MRSA has continued to advance. This same period has also seen numerous works dealing with the newer and emerging anti-staphylococcal antimicrobial agents. Important clinical trials involving linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, dalbavancin, and telavancin have been completed. At the same time, owing to the cost of newer agents and the broad susceptibility pattern of community-acquired MRSA, many older antimicrobial agents (long-acting tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, rifampin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycin) have also been reexamined. SUMMARY: As data accumulates, the newer antimicrobial agents active against community-acquired MRSA continue to demonstrate their value. Despite the appeal and abundant publications involving newer agents, older antimicrobials certainly retain a therapeutic role. Considerable work needs to be done prospectively evaluating older agents for community-acquired MRSA disease. The most important therapeutic intervention for the majority of community-acquired MRSA infections is adequate drainage of purulent fluid collections. Antimicrobial selection for community-acquired MRSA infections should be governed by disease severity, susceptibility patterns (especially based on timely clinical specimen culture), clinical response to therapy, and cost.
