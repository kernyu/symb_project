Pasteurella multocida isolates with high-level spectinomycin resistance in which no adenyltransferase genes could be demonstrated exhibited a C1192G transversion in the 16S rRNA of all six or five of the six rRNA operons and/or two different types of 3-bp deletions in the rpsE gene that codes for the ribosomal protein S5.
