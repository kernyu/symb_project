We describe a case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) complicated with retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a 56-year-old man. After administration of vancomycin and lavage of the retropharyngeal space with gentamicin, complete resolution of the RPA was observed. Despite their lower frequency, deep neck infections are associated with high mortality rates. The possibility of RPA should be considered in patients who present with fever, dysphagia and limitation of neck extension. Lavage of the retropharyngeal abscess with gentamicin may be optimal in cases of large RPA.
