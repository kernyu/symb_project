Plasmodium vivax is a serious health concern in many regions and is sometimes inadvertently treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). Mutations in the genes that encode dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) confer resistance to pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine, respectively. Numerous studies have examined the prevalence and diversity of mutations in P. vivax dhfr and some have assessed the relationship between dhfr genotype and clinical or in vitro response to pyrimethamine. Other studies have examined the impact of dhps genotype on response to sulfadoxine. These data indicate that, under certain circumstances, SP could be a valuable tool in the fight against P. vivax.
