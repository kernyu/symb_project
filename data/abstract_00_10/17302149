In order to explore the resistance, epidemical distribution and the staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec (SCCmec) types of Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in the area of Haikou, the resistance and SCCmec type of MRSA isolated from clinical sample has been tested using the K-B Agar diffuse, E-test and multiplex PCR strategy, resulting that two kinds of new SCC mec types were found in them. Type-newl possess three loci of B, M, F. Locus M, which locate in mecA, is the indicator of mecA, and also used as the positive control. Locus B, which locate in upstream of mec A, is specific for type- II and F, which locate in downstream of mec A, is specific for type- iU ; and so, type-newl was combined from the type- II and - I . Type-new2 possess five loci of A, B, M, F, H. Locus A, which is locate in upstream of mecA, is specific for type- I and H, which is locate in downstream of mecA, is also specific for type- 1 ; and so, type-new2 was combined from the type- I , - II and - I . The strains carrying new SCC mec types are different from that carrying old SCC mec types in the epidemical distribution and resistance to the antibiotics. They can be usually isolated from the out-patients and have high level and wider range of resistance to antibiotics. It must be paid more attention to them.
