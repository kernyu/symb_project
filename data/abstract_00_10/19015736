Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are a heterogeneous group of molecules involved in the nonspecific immune responses of a variety of organisms ranging from prokaryotes to mammals, including humans. AMP have various physical and biological properties, yet the most common feature is their antimicrobial effect. The majority of AMP disrupt the integrity of microbial cells by 1 of 3 known mechanisms--the barrel-stave pore model, the thoroidal pore model, or the carpet model. Results of growing numbers of descriptive and experimental studies show that altered expression of AMP in various tissues is important in the pathogenesis of several gastrointestinal, respiratory, and other diseases. We discuss novel approaches and strategies to further improve the promising future of therapeutic applications of AMP. The spread of antibiotic resistance increases the importance of developing a clinical role for AMP.
