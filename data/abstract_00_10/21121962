The large GTPase human guanylate binding protein-1 (GBP-1) is a key mediator of angiostatic effects of inflammation and is induced by interferon (IFN)-alpha and IFN-gamma in endothelial cells (ECs). The aim of this study was to investigate whether GBP-1 is a marker of skin lesions in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). Western blotting revealed that GBP-1 was in vitro induced by IFN-alpha and -gamma in primary keratinocytes obtained from healthy controls. Moreover, we found that this protein was expressed by keratinocytes and ECs in primary and ultraviolet (UV)-induced skin lesions from patients with various subtypes of CLE, when compared to non-lesional skin. No GBP-1 expression was noted in skin biopsy specimens 24 or 72 h after UV irradiation prior to lesion formation in patients with CLE or in healthy control specimens with or without UV irradiation. Initial findings suggest that GBP-1 is not expressed in other skin diseases with different inflammatory aetiology, such as atopic dermatitis. We conclude that GBP-1 expression is closely associated with skin lesions in patients with CLE, suggesting a contribution of GBP-1 in the pathogenesis of this disease.
