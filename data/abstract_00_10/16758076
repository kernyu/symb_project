Malaria is a protozoan infection caused by four Plasmodia species transmitted by female Anopheles mosquito. Nearly 40% of the world population is at risk of acquiring the disease because of increasing resistance to treatment, climate changes and travels to endemic zones. We report twelve patients with diagnosis of malaria, supported by the identification of parasites on blood smear. All cases had traveled to endemic zones (Peru, Ecuador, Central America, Africa), but only three used chemoprophylaxis. Seven cases were infected with Plasmodium vivax and five cases with P. falciparum. Three of latter required intensive care. All patients were treated with standard drugs according to the severity and Plasmodium specie, with excellent results and no mortality.
