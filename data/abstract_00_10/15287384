We report 2 patients with post-operative meningitis caused by drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP), following correction of frontoethmoidal encephalomeningocele in 1 patient and adenotonsillectomy in the other. Both patients responded well to vancomycin plus cefotaxime. DRSP may be colonized in the upper respiratory tract and causes serious infections after surgical operation.
