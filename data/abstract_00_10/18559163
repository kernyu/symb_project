OBJECTIVE: This study compared the clinical efficacy, time to symptom resolution, and tolerability of a 5-day regimen of telithromycin with a 10-day regimen of high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate in acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this multinational (41 centers in Canada, Germany, Greece, Portugal, and Turkey), open-label, noninferiority study, patients >/=18 years old (n=298) with a clinical (>7 days' symptoms) and radiological (air/fluid level, total opacification, mucosal thickening >/=10 mm) diagnosis of ABS were randomized to receive telithromycin 800 mg once daily for 5 days or amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg twice daily for 10 days. Clinical efficacy and tolerability were assessed at the test-of-cure visit (days 17-21). Time to symptom resolution was based on patients' daily diary assessment of individual symptoms. RESULTS: The per-protocol clinical success rate (primary endpoint) with telithromycin (88.6% (109/123)) was noninferior to that with amoxicillin-clavulanate (88.8% (111/125)) (95% confidence interval: -8.9 to 8.5). In the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, the median time for 50% reduction of total symptom scores was significantly shorter for telithromycin (4 days) vs. amoxicillin-clavulanate (5 days; p=0.044); median times for 75% reduction of total symptom scores were: telithromycin, 7 days; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 8 days (p=0.115). The median time for reduction of total symptom scores to the absent/very mild category (mITT population) was 6 days for telithromycin vs. 8 days for amoxicillin-clavulanate (p=0.04). All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly gastrointestinal and occurred in 20.7% (30/145) of telithromycin-treated patients vs. 31.8% (47/148) of amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated patients (p=0.034). One serious AE was reported in the telithromycin group, but it was considered not to be related to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This open-label, randomized study demonstrated that treatment of ABS with telithromycin resulted in comparable clinical efficacy, shorter times to symptom resolution, and fewer total TEAEs than treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate.
