The prevalence and antimicrobial resistance pattern of Salmonella isolates was determined from apparently healthy slaughtered cattle at Debre Zeit (Ethiopia). A total of 323 cattle were examined for the presence of Salmonella in faeces, mesenteric lymph nodes, abdominal and diaphragmatic muscles. Salmonellae were cultured from 23 (7.1%) of the animals. Salmonellae were isolated from 2 (3.1%) and 3 (4.5%) of 65 pooled faecal and mesenteric lymph node samples, respectively. Nine (2.8%) abdominal muscle and 10 (3.1%) diaphragmatic muscle samples (n = 323 of each) were contaminated by Salmonella. About 60% of the serovars identified in the abdominal and diaphragmatic muscles were also detected from faeces and mesenteric lymph node samples. The five different serovars isolated were Salmonella mishmarhaemek (48%) S. typhimurium (20%). S. enteritidis (12%), S. guildford (12%) and S. dublin (48%). The antimicrobial resistance profiles of 25 of the Salmonella isolates with 17 antimicrobials showed that 52%, (13/25) of them were resistant to three or more antimicrobials. Both strains of Salmonella (S. mishmarhaemek and S. typhimurium) showed multiple resistance to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole and ticarcillin.
