We studied sequence polymorphism, expression level of pfmdr1 gene and drug sensitivity in mefloquine sensitive-strain as well as mefloquine-resistant clone/24 to understand underlying drug resistance mechanism. Mefloquine-resistant clone/24 exhibited decreased susceptibility to mefloquine, quinine, halofantrine and artemisinin and increased susceptibility to chloroquine. We analyzed sequence of pfmdr1 gene and found mutation in pfmdr1 on clone/24. Moreover, overexpression of mRNA level of pfmdr1 has been observed in mefloquine-resistant clone/24. Our results explain gene mutation and expression level of pfmdr1 may be associated in mefloquine resistance mechanism.
