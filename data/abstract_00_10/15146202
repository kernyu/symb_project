BACKGROUND: The aim of the present paper was to determine the prevalence and characteristics shown by isolations of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, isolated in our Microbiology Service. METHODS: Retrospective study, covering the years 2000, 2001 and 2002. Analysis was made of the origin of the infection (nosocomial or non-nosocomial), the unit of origin in the event of nosocomial origin, anatomical localisation of the sample, and pattern of antibiotic sensitivity. RESULTS: The isolations of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 7.88% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolated. Less than half of the strains (44.87%) had a nosocomial origin and were most often isolated in the exudates of wounds. With respect to the pattern of resistance, there was some 50% of resistance to erythromycin, some 43.60% to clindamycine and some 21.79% to mupirocin. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and resistance pattern in vitro of the isolations of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus in our hospital are lower than that published in other areas of Spain.
