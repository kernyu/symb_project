In vitro activities of ertapenem and 11 other comparator agents were tested against 1025 isolates of respiratory pathogens collected from 12 Asian countries. Resistance rate to ertapenem was 1.2% in 602 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(50), 0.06/MIC(90), 1 microg/mL). Ertapenem was also very active against penicillin-, ciprofloxacin-, erythromycin-, and multidrug-resistant pneumococcal isolates (resistance rate: 3.5%, 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.7%, respectively). Ertapenem-resistant pneumococcal isolates were found only in Vietnam and Korea. Ertapenem resistance was not found in methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers. In vitro data suggest that ertapenem could be a useful treatment option for community-acquired pneumonia.
