A 14-year-old immunocompetent adolescent presented systemically unwell with left knee septic arthritis. Within several days, disseminated bone and soft tissue collections became evident, associated with deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary involvement. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was isolated, harbouring Panton-Valentine leucocidin genes. Aggressive antibiotic and surgical therapies eventually lead to recovery. Intrafamilial spread of the pathogenic isolate was shown by household screening. This presentation is consistent with 'PVL Syndrome' and is typical of severe S. aureus infection emerging in young populations globally.
