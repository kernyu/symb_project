Frequency of malaria and its resistance to chemotherapeutic options are emerging rapidly. To counter this problem, a series of 4-aminoquinolines having oxalamide and triazine functionalities in the side chain were synthesized and screened for their antimalarial activities. Triazine derivative 48 found to be the most active against CQ sensitive strain 3D7 of Plasmodium falciparum in an in vitro assay with an IC(50) of 5.23 ng/mL and oxalamide derivative 13 showed an in vivo suppression of 70.45% on day 4 against CQ resistant strain N-67 of Plasmodium yoelii.
