CTX-M-15-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli emerged recently in Cameroon. CTX-M-15 was encoded by two different multiresistance plasmids, of which one carried an ISEcp1-bla(CTX-M-15) element flanked by a 5-bp target site duplication and inserted within a Tn2-derived sequence. A truncated form of this element in the second plasmid was identified.
