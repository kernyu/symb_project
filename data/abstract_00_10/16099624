This study was planned to compare the efficacy of ceftriaxone+vancomycin with ceftriaxone+rifampicin in a rabbit model of penicillin and cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis. Meningitis was induced by intracisternal inoculation of S. pneumoniae. After 18 h of incubation, Group 1 was given saline solution (control group), whilst Groups 2 and 3 were given ceftriaxone+vancomycin and ceftriaxone+rifampicin, respectively. Cerebrospinal fluid bacterial concentrations were measured at 0, 2, 12, 14 and 24 h after therapy was initiated. In the control group, bacterial growth was present at all time points, whereas no growth was observed in either the ceftriaxone+vancomycin group or the ceftriaxone+rifampicin group after 2 h of therapy. Ceftriaxone+rifampicin was found to be as effective as ceftriaxone+vancomycin in the treatment of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae meningitis in experimental rabbit model.
