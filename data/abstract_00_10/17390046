The molecular mechanisms of apoptosis caused by IFN-gamma (interferon gamma)/LIGHT (lymphotoxin-related inducible ligand that competes for glycoprotein D binding to herpes virus entry mediator on T cells) have not been studied in detail. The present study was undertaken to gain insights into the signaling pathways involved in apoptosis induced by IFN-gamma/LIGHT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Cell proliferation assay, flow cytometry, Western blotting, gene transfer and RNA interference were used in this study. LIGHT enhanced IFN-gamma-mediated apoptosis in Hep3B cells. IFN-gamma/LIGHT-induced apoptosis was inhibited by blocking peptides to the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LT-beta R), and not by the herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM). Expression of LT-beta R remained unchanged after cytokine treatments. IFN-gamma/LIGHT treatment resulted in the down-regulation of Bcl-XL and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 as well as the decrease of phosphorylation of STAT3. HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells, which showed high levels of endogenous Bcl-XL, displayed resistance to IFN-gamma/LIGHT-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-XL in Hep3B cells increased the resistance to IFN-gamma/LIGHT induced apoptosis while the down-regulation of Bcl-XL in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells by RNA interference decreased the resistance. Our study provides important mechanistic insights into IFN-gamma/LIGHT- induced apoptosis in HCC cells and may help to select better therapeutic strategies for certain cancers with distinct Bcl-XL expression.
