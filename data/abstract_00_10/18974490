Emergence of extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs) producing strains of gram negative bacteria, as one of the leading cause of septicaemia often complicates the clinical and therapeutic outcome. The present study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence of ESBLs in bacteria isolated from neonatal septicaemic cases along with their antimicrobial sensitivity pattern. Blood samples were collected from 243 suspected cases of neonatal septicaemia. Apart from susceptibility testing, all the gram negative isolates were subjected to phenotypic tests for ESBL production. Amongst the positive test samples (n = 115), 84 were gram negative rods. ESBL was detected in 26 (32%) isolates. Results indicate that routine ESBL detection should be made imperative and empirical use of third generation cephalosporins must be discouraged.
