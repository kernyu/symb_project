We describe a case of recurrent Candida glabrata fungemia that became unresponsive to fluconazole treatment. Posttreatment isolates from blood and vaginal cultures of the immunocompetent patient were azole resistant and exhibited upregulated expression of CgCDR1/CgCDR2 efflux pumps compared to the original isolates. Amphotericin B therapy eradicated the infection.
