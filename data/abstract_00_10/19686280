The genetically heterogeneous taxon Candida parapsilosis was recently reclassified into three species: Candida parapsilosis, Candida orthopsilosis and Candida metapsilosis. The prevalences of these species among 141 bloodstream isolates tested in Brazil were 88% for C. parapsilosis, 9% for C. orthopsilosis, and 3% for C. metapsilosis. Except for three C. orthopsilosis isolates that were considered resistant to 5-flucytosine, all isolates representing the different species of this complex were susceptible to polyenes, triazoles and caspofungin.
