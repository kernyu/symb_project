Urinary tract infection is one of the most common diseases in children. Early diagnosis and comprehensive treatment can significantly decrease late serious complications. Knowledge of the sensitivity and resistance pattern of uropathogens in specific geographical locations is an important factor for choosing suitable antibacterial treatment. This study was conducted in order to evaluate the antibacterial resistance of urinary pathogens at Mofid Children's Hospital between March 2000 and August 2001. Positive urine cultures from 1,177 children aged less than 12 years (mean age, 31.7 months; female to male ratio, 2:1) were studied. Cultures were performed on urine samples obtained by sterile urine bags in infants and midstream urine in older children; if samples were contaminated then a suprapubic sample was taken in infants. Sensitivity was measured by the disc diffusion method using the NCCLS protocol. The most prevalent urinary pathogen was Escherichia coli (666 cases, 56.6%). Overall, the lowest resistance rate of microorganisms was that against ciprofloxacin (6.7%) and the highest resistance rate was that against penicillin (83%). A comparison of these data with those of other countries shows that there is considerable geographic variation in bacterial patterns of sensitivity and resistance properties. Therefore, the selection of antibiotics for empiric therapy should be based on the sensitivity and resistance pattern of uropathogens in the respective city.
