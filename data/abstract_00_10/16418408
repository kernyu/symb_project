BACKGROUND: Three point mutations (A2143G, A2142G, and A2142C) have been involved in Helicobacter pylori clarithromycin resistance. OBJECTIVE: To compare the eradication rates among the different point mutations and the efficacy of triple therapy and a sequential regimen according to genotypic resistance. DESIGN: Post hoc subgroup study from a multicenter, randomized trial. SETTING: Two hospitals in central and southern Italy between January and December 2001. PATIENTS: 156 patients with H. pylori infection. MEASUREMENTS: Real-time polymerase chain reaction for assessing clarithromycin resistance; histology, rapid urease test, and 13C-urea breath test at entry and after 4 to 6 weeks. INTERVENTION: 7-day triple therapy (20 mg of rabeprazole, 500 mg of clarithromycin, and 1 g of amoxicillin) in 75 patients or a 10-day sequential regimen (20 mg of rabeprazole plus 1 g of amoxicillin for 5 days and 20 mg of rabeprazole, 500 mg of clarithromycin, and 500 mg of tinidazole for the remaining 5 days) in 81 patients. All drugs were given twice daily. RESULTS: Helicobacter pylori infection was eradicated in 11 of 23 patients (48%) with the A2143G mutation and in 14 of 15 patients (93%) with either A2142G or A2142C strains (difference, 45 percentage points [95% CI, 15 to 65 percentage points]; P = 0.004). The sequential regimen achieved a higher cure rate than triple therapy in A2143G mutate strains (difference, 49 percentage points [CI, 8 to 72 percentage points]; P = 0.024). LIMITATIONS: The post hoc substudy design may require further confirmation. Other limitations are the accessibility to the tool and the cost of investigations (70 euros per patient). CONCLUSIONS: The A2143G mutation seemed to be associated with a very low eradication rate. The sequential regimen achieved a higher cure rate than standard therapy even in patients with these strains.
