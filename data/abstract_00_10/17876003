Testing of 12 pneumococcal strains with differing resistotypes [including tet(M) positive] showed that tigecycline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and ceftriaxone did not select for resistant clones after 50 sequential subcultures. By comparison, azithromycin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, telithromycin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gemifloxacin did show resistant clones. Tigecycline also yielded a low frequency of resistance in single-step tests compared to all beta-lactams, macrolides/ketolides, and quinolones tested.
