The impairment of NK cell functions in the course of HIV infection contributes to a decreased resistance against HIV and other pathogens. We analyzed the proportion of mature and immature NK cell subsets, and measured subsets of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha-producing NK and T cells in viremic or therapy-suppressed HIV-infected subjects, and noninfected control donors. Viremic HIV(+) individuals had significantly lower proportions of mature CD3(-)/CD161(+)/CD56(+) NK cells and of IFN-gamma-producing NK cells compared with noninfected donors, independent of CD4(+) T cell counts. HIV-infected subjects with undetectable viral load recovered mature CD3(-)/CD161(+)/CD56(+) NK cells and cytotoxicity against tumor (K562) and HSV-infected target cells to percentages comparable with those of uninfected individuals, but their NK cells remained impaired in their ability to produce IFN-gamma. In parallel to these ex vivo findings, in vitro NK cell differentiation of CD34-positive cord blood precursors in the presence of R5 or X4 HIV-1 resulted in the production of NK cells with a normal mature phenotype, but lacking the ability to produce IFN-gamma, whereas coculture of uninfected PBMC with HIV failed to affect mature NK cell properties or IFN-gamma secretion. Altogether, our findings support the hypothesis that mature NK cell phenotype may be uncoupled from some mature functions following highly active antiretroviral therapy-mediated suppression of HIV-1, and indicate that relevant innate immune functions of NK cell subsets may remain altered despite effective viral suppression following antiretroviral treatment.
