All of the isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 317), Enterococcus species (n = 315), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 282), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 176) collected at 16 Canadian microbiology laboratories from October 2000 to April 2001 were susceptible to linezolid. Future studies will determine how linezolid clinical use in Canada affects its in vitro activity.
