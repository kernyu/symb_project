Dalbavancin is an antimicrobial lipoglycopeptide agent that has proven activity against Gram-positive pathogens and a once weekly dosing advantage compared with other agents in the glycopeptide class. The most common pathogens isolated from skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs) include Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci (betaHS), and dalbavancin has demonstrated excellent activity against these species. This study used 18 medical center laboratories in 5 European countries to assess the activity of dalbavancin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin against S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), and betaHS. The rank order of potency was dalbavancin (MIC(50), 0.06 microg/mL) > teicoplanin (MIC(50), 0.5 microg/mL) > vancomycin (MIC(50), 2 microg/mL) and dalbavancin (MIC(50), 0.06 microg/mL) > teicoplanin and vancomycin (MIC(50), 2 microg/mL) against S. aureus and CoNS, respectively. Dalbavancin was the most active glycopeptide tested against betaHS with all strains inhibited by < or = 0.12 microg/mL. Susceptibility to other antimicrobial classes was also evaluated with noticeable differences demonstrated between countries. Higher methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) rates were observed in Italy (44.2%) and the United Kingdom (36.8%) compared with other countries, but resistance to erythromycin (51.6-83.1%) and clindamycin (5.7-68.4%) among MRSA also varied significantly between countries. The excellent contemporary activity of dalbavancin against common Gram-positive pathogens collected in European countries suggests that dalbavancin could have a role in the treatment of various types of SSSIs.
