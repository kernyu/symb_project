BACKGROUND/AIMS: The role of bile acids for insulin resistance in cholestatic liver disease is unknown. METHODS: The effect of taurolithocholic acid-3 sulfate (TLCS) on insulin signaling was studied in cultured rat hepatocytes and perfused rat liver. RESULTS: TLCS induced insulin resistance at the level of insulin receptor (IR) beta Tyr(1158) phosphorylation, phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase activity and protein kinase (PK)B Ser(473) phosphorylation in cultured hepatocytes. Consistently, the insulin stimulation of the PI 3-kinase-dependent K(+) uptake, hepatocyte swelling and proteolysis inhibition was blunted by TLCS in perfused rat liver. The PKC inhibitor Go6850 and tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) counteracted the suppression of insulin-induced IRbeta and PKB phosphorylation by TLCS. Rapamycin and dibutyryl-cAMP, which inhibited basal signaling via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), restored insulin-induced PKB- but not IRbeta phosphorylation. In livers from 7 day bile duct-ligated rats PKB Ser(473) phosphorylation was decreased by about 50%. CONCLUSION: TLCS induces insulin resistance by a PKC-dependent suppression of insulin-induced IRbeta phosphorylation and the PI 3-kinase/PKB path. This can in part be compensated by a decrease of mTOR activity, which may release insulin-sensitive components downstream of the insulin receptor from tonic inhibition. The data suggest that retention of hydrophobic bile acids confers insulin resistance on the cholestatic liver.
