OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate treatment outcome and characterize the pattern of genotype mutations in subjects with treatment failure on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) containing nelfinavir or indinavir. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The database of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study was screened for all subjects naive to protease inhibitor (PI) treatment who started HAART with nelfinavir or indinavir, responded initially (HIV-RNA <400 copies/ml) and received >24 weeks of treatment. Responders with subsequent treatment failure (HIV-RNA >1000 copies/ml, bordered by HIV-RNA >400 copies/ml) were selected for genotypic analysis. RESULTS: Initial treatment response, maintenance of response and subsequent virological failure were observed at a comparable frequency in 1143 nelfinavir and 1555 indinavir subjects. Of the treatment-naive patients, 13% who took nelfinavir and 16% who took indinavir had HIV-RNA >1000 copies/ml at least once. These values increased to 24 and 27%, respectively, for reverse transcriptase inhibitor-experienced subjects. Genotypic analysis in a subset of subjects with virological failure identified 30N as the only primary mutation in the nelfinavir subjects (8 out of 21, 38%) whereas isolated or combined 82A/T and 461/L mutations were detected in the indinavir subjects (9 out of 20, 45%). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of previously PI-naive subjects, the rate of virological failure and the frequency of resistance mutations at the time of virological failure were comparable in subjects receiving nelfinavir- or indinavir-containing HAART. In nelfinavir subjects, 30N was the only primary mutation whereas isolated or combined 82A/T and 461/L mutations were detected in indinavir subjects.
