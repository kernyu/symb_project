The emergence of drug resistance in pathogenic microorganisms provides an excellent example of microbial evolution that has had profound consequences for human health. The widespread use of antimicrobial agents in medicine and agriculture exerts strong selection for the evolution of drug resistance. Selection acts on the phenotypic consequences of resistance mutations, which are influenced by the genetic variation in particular genomes. Recent studies have revealed a mechanism by which the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) can alter the relationship between genotype and phenotype in an environmentally contingent manner, thereby 'sculpting' the course of evolution. Harnessing Hsp90 holds great promise for treating life-threatening infectious diseases.
