The development and introduction of new antibiotics has, unfortunately, not kept pace with the development of bacterial resistance, and the need for new agents is becoming acute. Although some currently marketed agents remain valuable tools in the treatment of infectious diseases, few new drugs have reached the market in the last decade. In recent years, antibiotics with activity against certain problematic resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, including linezolid and daptomycin, have been approved for clinical practice. Recently, tigecycline, a minocycline derivative, received approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of complicated skin and skin structure and intraabdominal infections; the agent is also active against a variety of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Of the other agents in phase III development, ceftobiprole--a cephalosporin, and faropenem and doripenem--both carbapenems, have wide antibacterial spectra. Antimicrobial agents in the pipeline with marked gram-positive activity include dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin.
