The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays an important role in controlling the passage of molecules from blood to brain extracellular fluid. The multidrug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is highly expressed in the luminal membrane of brain endothelium and contributes to the formation of a functional barrier to lipid-soluble drugs such as anticancer agents. The mdr1a P-gp-encoding gene is exclusively expressed in the rodent BBB. Primary cultures of rat brain endothelial cells and GP8.3 cells showed a dramatic decrease in mdr1a mRNA level and some expression of mdr1b mRNA. GPNT cells, derived from GP8.3 cells after transfection with a puromycin resistance gene, were chronically treated with 5 microg/mL puromycin, a P-gp substrate. Compared with rat brain endothelial cells and GP8.3 cells, GPNT cells exhibited a very high level of expression of mdr1a mRNA together with a moderate level of mdr1b mRNA expression. Accordingly, P-gp expression and activity were strongly increased. When GP8.3 and puromycin-starved GPNT cells were treated with puromycin, mdr1a expression was selectively increased. High expression of mdr1a mRNA in GPNT cells may thus be related to the chronic treatment with puromycin. We conclude that GPNT cells may be used as a valuable rat in vitro model for studying the regulation of mdr1a expression at the BBB level.
