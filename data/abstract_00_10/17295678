Seven E. coli isolates expressing resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins were recovered from blood (n=2), kidney and lung tissue (n=1), and urinary tract (n=4) samples from seven patients hospitalised or recently discharged from the Divisions of Geriatrics and Pulmonary Medicine, Central Hospital of Rogaland, between July and September 2004. All isolates expressed a typical ESBL-cefotaximase profile (cefotaxime MIC>ceftazidime MIC) with clavulanic acid synergy. A bla(CTX-M-15) genotype was confirmed in six strains that were coresistant to gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. A bla(CTX-M-3) genotype was detected in the last strain. XbaI-PFGE patterns of the six bla(CTX-M-15) isolates revealed a clonal relationship. Bla(CTX-M-15) strains were also positive for the ISEcp1-like insertion sequences that have been shown to be involved in the mobilization of bla(CTX-M.) Further analyses revealed two bla(CTX-M-15)-positive E. coli urinary isolates clonally related to the outbreak strain from two different patients at the same divisions in January and February 2004. These patients were later re-hospitalised and one had E. coli with an ESBL-cefotaximase profile in sputum and nasopharyngeal specimen during the outbreak period. Clinical evaluation suggests that the CTX-M-producing E. coli strains contributed to death in three patients due to delayed efficient antimicrobial therapy. The outbreak emphasises the epidemic potential of multiple-antibiotic-resistant CTX-M-15-producing E. coli also in a country with low antibiotic usage and low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.
