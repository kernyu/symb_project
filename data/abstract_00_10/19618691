OBJECTIVE: To characterize the diarrheal patients with Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) infections and to set up the first baseline for S. typhimurium pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns in Henan province, thus laying a foundation for comprehensive surveillance of Salmonella in human as well as foods. METHODS: S. typhimurium isolates recovered from outpatients with diarrhea in Henan province from May to October of 2006 were characterized. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of 8 antimicrobial agents and PFGE were carried out to analyze the S. typhimurium isolates. RESULTS: Twenty-four (0.9%) S. typhimurium isolates were identified from 2661 stool specimens of diarrheal cases. Eighty-eight percent of isolates showed resistance to at least one antimicrobial agent. The resistance to chloramphenicol (79%) was most common. Fifty-eight percent of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. All the 14 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were resistant to more than five antimicrobial agents. Thirty-three percent of S. typhimurium isolates were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline (R-type ACSSuT). Eight antimicrobia-resistant phenotypes were found among the 24 isolates in 16 PFGE patterns. CONCLUSION: The rate of multidrug-resistant S. typhimurium is relatively high in S. typhimurium PFGE patterns of Henan province. Multidrug-resistant S. typhimurium should be considered a public health threat.
