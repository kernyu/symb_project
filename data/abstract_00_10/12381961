Mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to be effective in the treatment of steroid-responsive minimal change disease. We report a case of steroid- and cyclosporin-resistant minimal change disease with severe nephrotic syndrome that responded to mycophenolate mofetil with complete remission. The patient remains in complete remission 1 year after the discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil. The presented case argues for the need of a prospective controlled study with the goal of evaluating the efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil in the therapy of steroid-resistant minimal change disease.
