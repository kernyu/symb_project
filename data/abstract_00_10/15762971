BACKGROUND: The purpose of this prospective, randomized study was to compare the efficacy of single-dose versus 1-day cefazolin prophylaxis for the prevention of postoperative gynecologic infections. METHODS: From June 2001 to January 2003, 548 patients were randomized to receive either single-dose (1 g of cefazolin intravenously before surgery, 273 patients) or 1-day cefazolin (1 g intravenously before surgery and three more doses every 6 hr after surgery, 275 patients) prophylaxis. RESULTS: A total of 531 (267 patients in the single-dose group and 264 in the 1-day group) completed the study. Only one of 267 (0.37%) patients in the single-dose group developed a trocar wound infection and one of 264 (0.37%) patients in the 1-day group developed a vaginal cuff infection. Had a single dose of prophylactic antibiotics been administered to all patients, the antibiotic cost would have been reduced by 75-80%. CONCLUSIONS: The use of single-dose preoperative cefazolin prophylaxis was as effective as four doses of cefazolin for preventing serious infectious morbidity among our patients. Shortening the duration of antibiotics prophylaxis also reduced medical costs and microorganism resistance.
