Genetic analysis of Curvularia lunata IM 2901 transformants, previously obtained by electroporation with plasmid pAN7-1, was carried out. Isolates displayed several differences in hygromycin B resistance and their physiology. It was shown that plasmid pAN7-1 was integrated in different copy numbers and at different positions in the genome of the strains studied. Both the wild type and pAN7-1 isolates, when growing in liquid media, produced an extracellular emulsifying agent. The transformants differed in their growth kinetics, intensity of surfactant production and in the efficiency of cortexolone 11beta-hydroxylation, in comparison with the wild type. The micro-organisms varied in susceptibility to the lytic enzyme complex (Novozyme 234), which indicated the presence of differences in their cell wall composition and/or in architecture caused by an integrated plasmid pAN7-1.
