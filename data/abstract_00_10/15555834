Pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most deadly form of community-acquired pneumonia. The death rate of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia has remained constant over the past 50 years. Several retrospective reviews of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia suggest that dual therapy with a beta-lactam and a macrolide antimicrobial agent is associated with a lower case fatality rate than therapy with a beta-lactam alone. These studies are reviewed, potential mechanisms are suggested, and future studies are discussed.
