OBJECTIVE: To provide current information on the epidemiology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients admitted to the intensive care unit during the era of combination antiretroviral therapy and to review issues related to the administration of antiretroviral therapy that are relevant to the intensivist. DESIGN: Review of literature related to intensive care of HIV-infected patients. RESULTS: Overall mortality of HIV-infected patients in the intensive care unit has decreased in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy, and patients are more commonly admitted with non-HIV-related illnesses. Use of antiretroviral therapy in the intensive care unit is difficult but may be associated with improved outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected patients are less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit with opportunistic infections but more likely to be admitted with problems unrelated to HIV infection or with conditions related to antiretroviral therapy. With current management strategies, more patients survive intensive care unit admission. Intensivists need to be familiar with antiretroviral therapy to recognize life-threatening toxicities unique to these drugs; to avoid drug interactions, which are extremely common and potentially life-threatening; and to avoid enhancing HIV drug resistance, an occurrence that could have devastating consequences for the patient following intensive care unit discharge.
