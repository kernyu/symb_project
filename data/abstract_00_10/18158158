Two lectin proteins were purified from the corms of Pinellia ternata and Lycoris radiata. Both P. ternata agglutinin (PTA) protein and L. radiata agglutinin (LRA) protein formed polymers and coagulated both rabbit red blood cells and yeast cells. The two proteins were each diluted to different concentration and then mixed with pinewood nematodes, and nematode survival was measured. Results showed that the two lectin proteins showed significant levels of resistance against nematodes and the nematode population was significantly reduced, compared to PBS buffer without protein control group. The mean number of nematodes of two lectin proteins group was significantly lower than that of control group constantly throughout the assay period with differences being very significant at P<0.01 after 24 h. After 96 h, when 500 microg/ml proteins were used, nematode number significantly declined to an average of 26 (approximately 43% of the controls) and 32.2 (approximately 53.3% of the controls) nematodes at LRA and PTA protein, respectively, compared to the control group. Results also indicated that higher concentrations of protein were more toxic to the pinewood nematode. Even when the concentration was as low as 30 microg/ml, the toxic proteins retained their anti-nematode activity. Furthermore, pinewood nematode was exposed to the proteins for longer, more pinewood nematodes were killed. Our results indicated the two lectin proteins both apparently have a toxic effect on the pinewood nematode that affects its survival in vitro.
