Several independent lines of evidence indicate that interferon-mediated innate responses are involved in controlling herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection and that the viral immediate-early regulatory protein ICP0 augments HSV-1 replication in interferon-treated cells. However, this is a complex situation in which the experimental outcome is determined by the choice of multiplicity of infection and cell type and by whether cultured cells or animal models are used. It is now known that neither STAT1 nor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) play essential roles in the replication defect of ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 in cultured cells. This study set out to investigate the specific role of ICP0 in HSV-1 resistance to the interferon defense. We have used a cell line in which ICP0 expression can be induced at levels similar to those during the early stages of a normal infection to determine whether ICP0 by itself can interfere with interferon or IRF-3-dependent signaling and whether ICP0 enables the virus to circumvent the effects of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that the presence of ICP0 was unable to compromise ISG induction by either interferon or double-stranded RNA. On the other hand, ICP0 preexpression reduced but did not eliminate the inhibitory effects of ISGs on HSV-1 infection, with the extent of the relief being highly dependent on multiplicity of infection. The results are discussed in terms of the relationships between ICP0 and intrinsic and innate antiviral resistance mechanisms.
