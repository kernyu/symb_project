Haemophilus influenzae is one of the main causes of otitis media, sinusitis, meningitis, pneumonia and septicaemia in children, and the development of ampicillin resistance in H. influenzae is a cause of serious concern. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of ampicillin resistance in H. influenzae colonizing the nasopharynx of school-going healthy North Indian children, and to compare the distribution of different biotypes and serotype b in this population. A total of 2400 school-going healthy children from 45 rural and 45 urban schools were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the children and cultured. H. influenzae was isolated from 1001 (41.7 %) of the 2400 nasopharyngeal swabs collected. All these H. influenzae isolates were biotyped and serotyped, and their antibiotic susceptibility tested. All eight biotypes were present in this population. The most prevalent biotypes were I (19.6 %), II (16.8 %) and III (25.0 %). Of the 1001 isolates, 316 (31.6 %) were H. influenzae type b and 685 (68.4 %) were non-type b H. influenzae, and 22.9 % were resistant to ampicillin, 41.9 % to chloramphenicol, 27.5 % to erythromycin and 67.3 % to co-trimoxazole. Of the 316 H. influenzae type b isolates, 44.0 % were ampicillin resistant, while only 13.1 % non-type b H. influenzae isolates were ampicillin resistant. Of the 229 ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates, 196 (85.6 %) were positive for beta-lactamase; 93.4 % (214/229) were biotypes I, II and III, of which 49 % were biotype I, 27.9 % were type II and 16.6 % were type III. Most of the strains belonging to biotypes III-VIII were ampicillin sensitive. Ampicillin resistance is significantly more common in biotype I and serotype b than in other biotypes and serotypes.
