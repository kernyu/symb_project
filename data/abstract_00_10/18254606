A preceding paper (Bonfanti et al. J. Med Chem. 2007, 50, 4572-4584) reported the optimization of the pharmacokinetic profile of substituted benzimidazoles by reducing their tissue retention. However, the modifications that were necessary to achieve this goal also led to a significant drop in anti-RSV activity. This paper describes a molecular modeling study followed by a lead optimization program that led to the recovery of the initial potent antiviral activity and the selection of TMC353121 as a clinical candidate.
