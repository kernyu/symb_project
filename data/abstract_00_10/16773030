INTRODUCTION: We used a sensitive point mutation assay, LigAmp, to detect and quantify K103N-containing variants in African women who received single-dose nevirapine (NVP) to prevent mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission. METHODS: Plasma for testing was collected 6 to 8 weeks postpartum from 301 women (144 subtype A, 63 subtype C, and 94 subtype D). RESULTS: The portion of women with 0.5% or more K103N-containing variants was lowest for subtype A (60/144, 41.7%) and highest for subtype C (44/63, 69.8%; P < 0.0001). K103N was rarely detected in pre-NVP samples. In a multivariate model, K103N detection was associated with HIV-1 subtype (C > A), after adjusting for log10 delivery viral load, the number of days between NVP dosing and sample collection, age, and parity. Among women with K103N detected: (1) the median %K103N was lower for subtype A (2.2%) than C (11.7%, P = 0.0001) or D (5.5%, P = 0.04), and (2) in a multivariate linear model, higher log10 (%K103N) was associated with HIV subtype (C > A, P = 0.0001; D > A, P = 0.01; and C vs D, no difference), but not other factors. CONCLUSIONS: After administration of single-dose NVP, K103N was detected more frequently and at higher levels in women with subtypes C and D than A. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of NVP-resistant variants in this setting.
