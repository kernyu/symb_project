The recent availability of bacterial genome sequence information permits the identification of conserved genes that are potential targets for novel antibiotic drug discovery. Using a coupled bioinformatic/experimental approach, a list of candidate conserved genes was generated using a Microbial Concordance bioinformatics tool followed by a targeted disruption campaign. Pneumococcal sequence data allowed for the design of precise PCR primers to clone the desired gene target fragments into the pEVP3 'suicide vector'. An insertion-duplication approach was employed that used the pEVP3 constructs and resulted in the introduction of a selectable chloramphenicol resistance marker into the chromosome. In the case of non-essential genes, cells can survive the disruption and form chloramphenicol-resistant colonies. A total of 347 candidate reading frames were subjected to disruption analysis, with 113 presumed to be essential due to lack of recovery of antibiotic-resistant colonies. In addition to essentiality determination, the same high-throughput methodology was used to overexpress gene products and to examine possible polarity effects for all essential genes.
