The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program is a multicenter, longitudinal surveillance study initiated in 1997 that compares the activity of meropenem and comparator antimicrobials in centers that are actively prescribing meropenem. Antimicrobial surveillance programs, such as MYSTIC, provide important information on the emergence of bacterial resistance and the nature of the underlying mechanisms in different geographical regions. Data concerning these mechanisms and patterns of antimicrobial resistance allow the implementation of changes in antimicrobial prescribing practices and infection control interventions. Therefore, it is important that data from surveillance programs be analyzed and accessible to clinicians within reasonable, clinically useful, intervals. In this article, the use of a website designed to disseminate data collected from the MYSTIC program is described. This web-based program allows specific surveillance data to be examined in a timely manner and can assist the clinician when choosing the most appropriate antibiotic for the situation encountered and hopefully maximize successful clinical outcomes.
