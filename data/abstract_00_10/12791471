Quinolone in vivo bactericidal activity was investigated in a guinea pig pneumonia model using three Streptococcus pneumoniae strains with decreasing susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Treatment regimens resulted in values of AUC(0-24 h) and C(30 min) similar to those of standard oral regimens in human serum. Efficacy was defined as a significant difference in number of viable bacteria in the lungs compared with the control. Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gemifloxacin were effective against the levofloxacin-susceptible strain. Only gemifloxacin achieved a >/=99.9% reduction versus control against the levofloxacin intermediate-resistant strain. Gemifloxacin achieved a 99.69% reduction and was the only quinolone significantly different from the control (P<0.05) against the levofloxacin-resistant strain. Gemifloxacin offers in vivo activity against ciprofloxacin- to levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci.
