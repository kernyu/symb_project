Three-year microbiological and clinical monitoring (2003-2005) confirmed the high clinical and microbiological efficacy of cefoperazone/sulbactame (sulperazone, Pfizer) used in the Hospital for the treatment of infectious complications in the oncologic patients. The empirical use of the drug in the therapy of severe infectious complications undoubtedly proved its value. It should be indicated that the high efficacy of cefoperazone/sulbactam and a great variety of the indications nevertheless require a well-considered approach to its use first of all based on the data of the microbiological monitoring in the hospital. It is natural that the drug primarily should control nonfermenting gramnegative bacteria and enterobacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. When the infectious complication is due to a microbial association, it is expedient to combine cefoperazone/sulbactam for example with amikacin (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), vancomycin (methicillin resistant staphylococci and ampicillin resistant enterococci) or fluconazole (Candida). Therefore, to preserve the activity of the drug, its use should be strictly limited by the indications with an account of the pathogen susceptibility and the infection severity.
