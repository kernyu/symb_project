In recent years, the importance of the community as a breeding ground for antibiotic-resistant pathogens is being recognized. Prescription of antimicrobial drugs for viral infections, inadequate dosage, use of long-acting macrolides and broad-spectrum antibiotics, and accessibility of over-the-counter antibiotics in many countries are the main drivers of increasing resistance. Education of physicians and the public on the correct use of antibiotics, introduction of rapid and reliable laboratory methods to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections, and offering economic incentives to the pharmaceutical industry to develop new drugs appear to be key issues in the confrontation with this serious public health problem.
