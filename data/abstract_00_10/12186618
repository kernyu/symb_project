Several new fluoroquinolones have been marketed since the late 1990s. Fluoroquinolones are an effective treatment for most community-acquired respiratory tract infections, including acute sinusitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and community-acquired pneumonia. However, other antibiotics, including beta-lactams, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, are also effective against these respiratory infections. From a managed care perspective, it is the subtle differences between the drugs in the eradication of bacterial pathogens, adverse effects, dose regimens, compliance issues, bacterial resistance and cost that determine the best choice for the management of pneumonia, sinusitis or exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The potential for bacterial resistance is perhaps the only significant barrier to extensive fluoroquinolone use in community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Cost-effectiveness must be balanced with quality care, both from an individual perspective and that of the greater society.
