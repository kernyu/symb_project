A 24-year-old man suffering from end-stage, multi-drug, resistant tuberculosis and right heart failure underwent bilateral, single-lung transplantation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support. He was successfully weaned and discharged from the hospital 30 days later. Sputum cultures have been negative for tuberculosis since discharge, and for almost 2 years thereafter. Anti-tuberculosis medication was discontinued 4 months postoperatively.
