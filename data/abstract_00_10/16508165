We cloned a gene responsible for multidrug resistance from the chromosomal DNA of Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH78578 that showed multidrug resistance. We designated the gene kmrA. The deduced amino acid sequence of KmrA was similar to that of SmvA that is responsible for methyl viologen-resistance in Salmonella enterica sv. Typhi and Typhimurium. Introduction of the cloned kmrA gene into drug-hypersensitive Escherichia coli KAM32 cells made them resistant to acriflavine, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), Hoechst 33342, tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (TPPCl), methyl viologen and ethidium bromide. We observed elevated energy-dependent efflux of ethidium in E. coli cells carrying the kmrA gene compared with control cells. We also cloned the smvA gene from S. enterica sv. Typhimurium LT2 and investigated the resistance pattern for several drugs. The pattern was similar between KmrA from K. pneumoniae and SmvA from S. enterica.
