We report the first case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ulcerative keratitis after routine bilateral laser in situ keratomileusis. Within 24 hours of initial ulceration the lamellar flap melted, disintegrating into necrotic fragments. Recognition of lamellar flap infections followed by immediate medical and surgical management is critical to preserving vision.
