Aminoglycosides are often prescribed as part of the treatment regimen for acute pulmonary exacerbations due to their potent activity and low potential for development of resistance. Preliminary evidence from randomized controlled trials in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) suggests that once-daily administration of aminoglycosides results in similar efficacy and a low risk for toxicity compared with traditional dosing. The pharmacokinetics of aminoglycosides administered once daily in CF patients are currently not well described. In this study we compare the distribution and elimination patterns of traditional dosing (3.3 mg/kg q8h) versus once-daily dosing (10 mg/kg q24h) of tobramycin in six adult patients with CF. The pharmacokinetics of tobramycin administered either once daily or every 8 h were best described by a two-compartment model. No statistically significant differences in any of the pharmacokinetic parameter values between regimens were noted. The distribution phase half-lives of 32 and 24 min following the q8h and q24h regimens were longer than expected. The use of a one-compartment model requires clinical peak levels to be drawn 2 h after initiation of either a 30 min infusion for multiple daily dosing or a 60 min infusion with once-daily dosing, to ensure completion of the distribution phase. Our data indicate that a dose of 10 mg/kg/day provides post-distributional phase peak concentrations that achieve the desired goal for susceptible organisms (>20 mg/L) and AUC(24) values at the upper end of the desired range (70-100 mg.h/L).
