We evaluated the antifungal susceptibility profile of 200 recent bloodstream isolates of Candida spp. sequentially obtained from patients admitted to five tertiary care hospitals in Brazil. Isolates were identified by classical methods and the antifungal susceptibility profile was determined by the NCCLS microbroth assay method. Candida albicans was the most frequent species (41.5%); followed by C. tropicalis (24%) and C. parapsilosis (20.5%). The frequency of C. glabrata and C. krusei was low (nine and two isolates, respectively). Only three strains were resistant to fluconazole (two C. krusei and one C. glabrata) and only one was resistant to itraconazole (the same C. glabrata strain that was resistant to fluconazole). Two strains were considered susceptible dose-dependent (SDD) to fluconazole and 13 isolates (6.5%) were SDD to itraconazole. Overall, the MIC50 value of non-C. albicans isolates for fluconazole was two dilutions higher than that of C. albicans isolates, and for itraconazole was one dilution higher. Resistance to amphotericin B (MIC > or = 2 microg ml(-1)) was observed in 2.5% of isolates (two strains of C. albicans, two of C. parapsilosis and one of C. krusei). This study showed that episodes of candidemia in Brazilian public hospitals are represented mainly by fluconazole-susceptible non-C. albicans species. This finding is probably related to the low use of fluconazole in these hospitals.
