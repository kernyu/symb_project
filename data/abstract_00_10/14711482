Comparative and trend analysis was conducted on annual prevalence of antimicrobial susceptibility among Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli recovered from rural Egyptian children from 1995 through 2000. C. jejuni and C. coli demonstrated significant decreasing trends in ciprofloxacin susceptibility over the study period (p < 0.001 for both). In general, C. coli demonstrated a higher degree of susceptibility than C. jejuni, however, there was no statistical difference (p = 0.2) comparing the linear trends over the duration of the study. There was no indication of frank macrolide (erythromycin or azithromycin) resistance among any Campylobacter. Moreover, there were statistically significant positive trends in both the MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for the erythromycin and azithromycin during the study period, suggesting a possible decreasing trend in susceptibility among Campylobacter. This study demonstrated that antimicrobial susceptibility in Campylobacter has significantly decreased from 1995 through 2000 among pediatric diarrhea cases in rural Egypt.
