We investigated the susceptibility to 6 fluoroquinolones against 433 strains of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from 6 medical facilities in Gifu prefecture between January and September in 2005, determined by the agar dilution methods in according with the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. We also investigated the correlation between the degree of resistance to fluoroquinolones and the amino acid substitutions in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR). The tested clinical isolates were as follows, Salmonella spp.; 17 strains, Escherichia coli; 112 strains Citrobacter freundii; 35 strains, Enterobacter cloacae; 31 strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae; 73 strains, Proteus spp.; 18 strains, Providencia spp.; 3 strains, Morganella morganii; 14 strains, Serratia marcescens; 27 strains and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 103 strains. The number of the strains resistant to ciprofloxacin (CPFX) (MIC > or = 6.25 microg/mL) was twenty (E. coli; 14 strains, E. cloacae; I strain, Proteus spp.; 2 strains and P. aeruginosa; 3 strains). Among these strains, 12 strain (E. coli; 11 strains and E. cloacae; 1 strain) were highly resistant to CPFX (MIC > or =25 microg/mL). The E. coli strains highly resistant to CPFX had the multiple amino acid mutations in QRDR of ParC an GyrA. However in other strains, there was no strains possessing multiple mutations in both ParC and GyrA.
