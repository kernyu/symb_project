The aim of this study was to reassess the activity of fosfomycin against recently isolated uropathogens circulating in Italy and to evaluate the effect of fosfomycin resistance on the expression of several virulence traits using the rare mutant strains. In vitro activity of fosfomycin was evaluated using 441 Gram-negative organisms isolated from patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Fosfomycin was the most active antibiotic against Escherichia coli (99% susceptibility). The activity against Proteus mirabilis was more potent than that of co-trimoxazole and nitrofurantoin (87.5, 67 and 0% susceptibility, respectively). The other microorganisms, accounting for about 7% of all pathogens tested, showed variable susceptibilities to fosfomycin. Compared with susceptible strains, fosfomycin-resistant mutants showed a reduced rate of growth and were impaired in their ability to adhere to uroepithelial cells and to urinary catheters. They were also more resistant to UV irradiation and to phage T7 and showed diminished rates of colicin synthesis and transfer of plasmids.
