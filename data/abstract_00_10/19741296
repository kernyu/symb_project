BACKGROUND: Enteric fever is a major public health problem in India. The current treatment of choice is the fluoroquinolones. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin was determined by E-test, HIMEDIA HiComb MIC test and agar dilution. RESULTS: An isolate of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) from a case of enteric fever gave a ciprofloxacin MIC of 64 microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge there have been no reports of such high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin in S. Typhi from southern India. HIMEDIA HiComb MIC test method is an alternative to the E-test. Ciprofloxacin resistant typhoid fever responds to treatment with ceftriaxone.
