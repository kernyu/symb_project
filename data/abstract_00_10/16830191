In this study, we investigated the yeasts colonization of genus Candida, including C. dubliniensis, isolated of HIV-infected patients oral cavities and we accessed in vitro susceptibility pattern of the Candida isolates to four antifungal agents. Out of 99 patients investigated, 62 (62.6%) were colonized with yeasts. C. albicans was the prevailing species (50%). C. dubliniensis isolates were not recovered in our study. We verified that 8.1% of the yeasts isolated were resistant to fluconazole, 8.1% to itraconazole and 3.2% to voriconazole. The isolates demonstrated very low voriconazole MICs, in which 79% (49/62) presented values of 0.015 mug/ml. All Candida isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B. The results reported here showed that although C. albicans continues to be present in one-half of oral Candida carriage of HIV-infected patients, Candida non-albicans species are increasing among these patients. Besides, the findings of resistant isolates endorse the role of antifungal susceptibility testing whenever antifungal treatment with azoles is planned.
