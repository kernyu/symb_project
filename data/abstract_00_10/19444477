Urinary tract infections, with or without reflux, are the most frequent reason for long-term antibacterial prophylaxis in infants and children. When one is considering the use of prophylaxis in these children, what is clear from existing published data? Up to 2006 there were a small number of poor quality studies, with no reliable evidence of the effectiveness of antibiotics in preventing recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs). Since then, four randomised controlled studies, to assess the benefits, or lack thereof, of antibiotic prophylaxis, have been published. None has demonstrated a clear benefit. The following conclusions can be drawn: antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated for children following a first febrile UTI if no or mild grade I or II reflux is present; for higher grade reflux there is no definite conclusion.
