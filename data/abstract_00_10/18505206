The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the level of agreement of the E-test for in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Campylobacter coli using the agar dilution technique, which is the approved method. A convenience sample of 80 Ontario swine farms was chosen for this study; each farm was visited from January to June 2004. A total of 233 isolates of C. coli were tested for susceptibility to 10 antimicrobials by agar dilution and the E-test. Performance of the tests was evaluated using 7 quality control strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Campylobacter jejuni ATCC 33560, and Campylobacter coli ATCC 33559 for the E-test and E. coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and C. jejuni ATCC 33560 for the agar dilution test. Weighted Cohen's kappa and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) tests were used for statistical analysis. The E-test and agar dilution test results had a strong agreement when resistance to streptomycin and tetracycline were evaluated (weighted kappa: 0.68 and 0.66, respectively). However, marked disagreement was detected when testing susceptibility to nalidixic acid and ampicillin (0.15 and 0.22, respectively). Almost perfect agreement was detected by PABAK when testing susceptibility to gentamicin (0.99). Agreement was found to be moderate for ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol. Although the level of agreement between the E-test and agar dilution depended on the antimicrobial being tested, the E-test always detected a lower proportion of resistant isolates compared to agar dilution.
