The cumulative antibiogram (CA) represents a report which summarizes the susceptibility of commonly isolated microorganisms to usual antibiotics in a defined period of time. We have evaluated the local resistance data during the year 2007 by generating CA from the bacteriology laboratory's database in Mures County Emergency Clinical Hospital for 3 categories of microorganisms: Gram-positive cocci, Gram-negative enteric rods and non-fermenters. A total of 1382 individual antibiotic susceptibility reports were analysed. Gram-positive cocci were susceptible 100% to glycopeptides and oxazolidinones. Fifty percent of S. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant. More than 90% of S. aureus and MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) isolates were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Gram-negative enteric rods were 100% susceptible to carbapenems. The susceptibility of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae to broad spectrum cephalosporins was 72% and 26%, respectively. The activity of carbapenems against Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 43% and 35%, respectively. Colistin was active in 100% of the isolated nonfermenters. CA is a useful tool for evaluation of local resistance data but careful interpretation of generated data is required in order to avoid under- or overestimation of resistance.
