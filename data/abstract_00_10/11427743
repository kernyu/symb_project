Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of strains of Escherichia coli isolated between 1994 and 1998 were studied. Of the 1,283 strains examined, 75% were recovered from urine, 8.7% from wounds, 3.2% from blood, 2.6% from pus, and 10.5% from other sources. Isolates from inpatients and outpatients accounted for 46.1% and 53.9%, respectively. Gentamicin and nalidixic acid showed the greatest efficacy against isolates from both inpatients and outpatients, revealing a >90% sensitivity. Drugs with the lowest efficacies were ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, which showed a >45% resistance. Tetracycline showed a significant decline in resistance from 1994 to 1998 among strains from both inpatients and outpatients (P < 0.001). This decline may be related to a policy of restrictive antibiotic reporting by the Microbiology Laboratory and seminars for general practitioners, subsequent to an island-wide survey an antibiotic resistance. A similar pattern of declining resistance was also observed for cefuroxime. E. coli sensitivity to co-trimoxazole was relatively stable during the study period. Although the overall prevalence of resistance among E. coli strains is relatively low, on-going surveillance of bacterial resistance must continue. The microbial antibiogram can provide general practitioners and clinicians with data essential for optimum empiric choices. Further, the introduction of a policy of restrictive reporting may act "synergistically" with the education of doctors on resistance patterns, to effect island-wide reduction of antimicrobial resistance.
