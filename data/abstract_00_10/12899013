The remote postoperative results were followed up for as long as up to 10 years. It was established in case of abacillary patients that the frequency rate of relapses was minimal ranging from 3.6% in the group of patients operated for tuberculosis and caseous-necrotic tuberculosis to 11.5% in fibrous-cavernous tuberculosis. Patients with bacterial discharge, primarily of the extensive nature, had more often relapses (19.4% in operated patients for caseous-necrotic tuberculosis and 31.7% in patients operate for fibrous-cavernous tuberculosis). Drug resistance (DR) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) to three and more anti-TB preparations essentially increase a possibility of relapses in all clinical forms of tuberculosis with maximum threat being in patients with fibrous-cavernous lesions (36%). As for the repeatedly operated patients for postoperative relapses involving DR MBT to isoniazid and rifampicin, only slightly above 50% of them survived 5 years after surgery; the index of the 5-year survival was 33% among the patients with DR to 4 and more drugs.
