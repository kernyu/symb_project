A case of congenital coronary arteriovenous fistula with infective endocarditis caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus mitis is reported. Lack of prophylactic antibiotics during dental procedure may cause the development of endocarditis. Bactericidal test (Schlichter test) was performed to guide the therapy for this case of bacterial endocarditis caused by penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci. This case highlights the importance of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with underlying heart disease undergoing dental procedures.
