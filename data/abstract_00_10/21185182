A series of novel ureas and thioureas of 3-decladinosyl-3-hydroxy 15-membered azalides, were discovered, structurally characterized and biologically evaluated. They have shown good antibacterial activity against selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. These include N'' substituted 9a-(N'-carbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl)- (6a,c), 9a-(N'-thiocarbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl)- (7a,e), 9a-[N'-(beta-cyanoethyl)-N'-(carbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl)]- (9a-c, 9g) 9a-[N'-(beta-cyanoethyl)-N'-(thiocarbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl)]-derivatives (10d-f) of 5-O-desosaminyl-9-deoxo-9-dihydro-9a-aza-9a-homoerythronolide A (3). Among the synthesized compounds thiourea 7a and urea 9b have shown substantially improved activity comparable to azithromycin (1) and significantly better activity than the 3-decladinosyl-azithromycin (2) and the parent 3-cladinosyl analogues against efflux-mediated resistant S. pneumoniae.
