Nocardiasis is an uncommon bacterial disease often observed in immunodepressed patients. Its interactions with the immune system remain poorly known. We report a case of Nocardia asteroides thoracic nocaridiasis in an African subject who also had macrophage activation syndrome. We recall the classic data on nocardiasis in Africa and emphasize the importance of emergence in HIV-infected subjects. The association between nocardiasis and macrophage activation syndrome suggest a possible pathogenic mechanism involving the immune system (lymphocytes and macrophages) and Nocardia asteroides.
