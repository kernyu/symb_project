Establishment rate of Haemonchus contortus in non-suppressed and immunosuppressed gerbils within 14 days post-infection was compared after inoculation with 1,000 third-stage larvae (L3), exsheathed BZ-susceptible larvae. Based on significantly higher number of larvae in gerbils receiving low doses of immunosuppressant agent hydrocortisone, development of benzimidazole (BZ)-susceptible and BZ-resistant strain of nematode in the stomach was studied on days 4, 7, 10, and 14 p.i. Sections of stomach from both groups of animals were examined for overall histopathological response and dynamics of mucosal mast cells (MMC) and connective tissue mast cells (CTMC). In the immunosuppressed gerbils, H. contortus L3 stage larvae developed to the L4 stage on days 10 and 14 p.i., and their sex ratio was higher toward female worms. Significantly higher ratios of establishment rate were recorded for BZ-susceptible than BZ-resistant strain. Infection elicited strong inflammation mainly in the lamina propria mucosae, where MMC numbers peaked on day 7 p.i., being present in a significantly higher numbers in gerbils infected with BZ-susceptible strain. Infection with BZ-susceptible strain of nematode also resulted in a higher number of CTMC in comparison with the effect of BZ-resistant strain, which were observed in the tela submucosa only. Thus, H. contortus infection in gerbils seems to be a suitable model to study host-parasite interactions. Our results indicate that BZ-resistant strain of H. contortus have a decreased capacity to establish infection in direct relation with lower mucosal and connective tissue MCs counts in the stomach.
