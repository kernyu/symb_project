It was shown that sensitivity of Vibrio cholerae eltor P-5879 to tetracycline, levomycetin, furazolidone, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, rifampicin, quinolones in vitro correlated with drugs efficacy in the treatment of experimental cholera of albino mice. Mutants of V. cholerae eltor P-5879 Nalr resistant to nalidixic acid (MIC 160-200 mg/l) formed with frequency 10(-9)-110(-8) had no cross resistance to fluoroquinolones. But the efficacy of ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin against these mutants in vivo reduced, though it was not changed in vitro. Mutants of V. cholerae eltor P-5879 resistant to fluoroquinolones and selected after culturing in the presence of the drugs had cross resistance to all quinolones studied. Infection caused by Cpfr mutant could not be treated with nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones, therapeutic efficacy of rifampicin and beta-lactams, also reduced though sensitivity in vitro was not changed. The results of investigation proves the necessity of quinolones use for cholerae treatment as it is recommended for other severe enteric infections.
