Besifloxacin hydrochloride ophthalmic suspension 0.6% (Besivance) is a recently approved fluoroquinolone for the topical treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against common bacterial pathogens causing conjunctivitis, i.e., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae as well as against other less common organisms. In addition to being a potent agent against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens including those resistant to other fluoroquinolones, besifloxacin has balanced DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV activity, which should slow the development of resistance. Topical administration achieves high sustained concentrations in human tears and good ocular tissue penetration in animals while demonstrating an excellent safety profile. Besifloxacin's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics meet the criteria for successful eradication of many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria while demonstrating minimal systemic exposure. The biochemical properties, achievement of target pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic goals and the restriction of besifloxacin to topical ophthalmic use should result in slower development of bacterial resistance, making besifloxacin a new, appealing option for empiric therapy in acute bacterial conjunctivitis.
