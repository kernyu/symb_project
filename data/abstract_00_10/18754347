The tetracycline (TC) resistance gene tet(M) was monitored in bacteria isolated from Japanese coastal and off-shore marine sediments. The high rate of occurrence of TC resistant (TC(r)) bacteria (120 microg mL(-1) TC) was observed at frequency ranges between 0.0-0.08% in Tokyo Bay, 1.67-1.82% in Sagami Bay and 0.0-4.35% in the open Pacific Ocean. The tet(M) gene was PCR amplified from the TC(r) isolates, showing 127 of 209 isolates (60.8%) as positive. The rate of occurrence of tet(M) was between 32.0-96.0%, 21.1 -28.0% and 0.0-83.3% in the isolates from Tokyo Bay, Sagami Bay and the open Pacific Ocean, respectively. The tet(M) positive isolates belonged to 4 orders of bacteria. Bacillales was the most dominant order (121 strains) among tet(M) possessing bacteria, followed by Actinomycetales (three strains), Flavobacteriales (one strain) and Pseudomonadales (one strain). This indicates that tet(M) is present in various bacterial species and suggests that marine sediments are a natural reservoir of the tet(M) gene. Nucleotide sequence of the tet(M) revealed that two genotypes of tet(M) were found in the bacteria. The two genotypes were placed in genetically distant branches of the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that the two tet(M)s have different origins.
