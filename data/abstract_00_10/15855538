The pfcrt allelic type and adjacent microsatellite marker type were determined for 82 Plasmodium falciparum isolates from the Philippines. Mutant pfcrt allelic types P1a and P2a/P2b were dominant in different locations. Microsatellite analysis revealed that P2a/P2b evolved independently in the Philippines, while P1a shared common ancestry with Papua New Guinea chloroquine-resistant parasites.
