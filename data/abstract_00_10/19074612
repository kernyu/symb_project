A total of 210 Salmonella isolates, representing 64 different serovars, were isolated from imported seafood samples, and 55/210 isolates were found to be resistant to at least one antibiotic. Class 1 integrons from three multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica strains (Salmonella enterica serovars Newport [strain 62], Typhimurium var. Copenhagen [strain 629], and Lansing [strain 803], originating from Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Taiwan, respectively) were characterized. Southern hybridization of plasmids isolated from these strains, using a class 1 integron probe, showed that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and streptomycin resistance genes were located on a megaplasmid in strain 629. Our study indicates that imported seafood could be a reservoir for Salmonella isolates resistant to multiple antibiotics.
