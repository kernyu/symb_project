A suspected case of multiple anthelmintic resistance on a farm in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, into which South African Boer goats had previously been imported, was confirmed in a controlled test. Twenty sheep were allocated into one control group and three treatment groups to determine the efficacy of mebendazole, ivermectin and moxidectin applying the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). The sheep were slaughtered 1 week later and post-mortem worm counts were performed. Benzimidazole and ivermectin resistance were found in Haemonchus contortus with an efficacy of 55 and 61%, respectively. Moxidectin appeared to be effective when the data was analysed according to the recommended analytical techniques with an efficacy of 96%. This is the first description of resistance of gastrointestinal nematodes to one of the macrocyclic lactones in small ruminants in Switzerland. The results are discussed in relation to the importance of controlling livestock before importation.
