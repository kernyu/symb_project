Here we demonstrated that the small plasmids below (20 kpb) are responsible for maintaining and dissemination of ESBL phenotype among the different species of Enterobacteriaceae family. The similarity of plazmid profiles isolated from E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and K. oxytoca suggests possibility of the exchange of these plazmids between two mentioned species of bacteria.
