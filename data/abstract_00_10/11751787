The anti-staphylococcal activity of ABT-773, a new member of the ketolides, was examined and compared with those of erythromycin and clarithromycin using the agar dilution method. A total of 336 well-defined clinical isolates of staphylococci, including a large number of clonally different methicillin-resistant strains with defined macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B)) resistance phenotypes were tested. The novel ketolide exhibited broad-spectrum anti-staphylococcal activity against both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains. Apart from strains with constitutive expression of MLS(B) resistance, all staphylococcal strains tested were inhibited by < or = 0.063 mg/L of ABT-773, irrespective of the resistance phenotype for methicillin.
