This study aimed to identify the activity of eight antibiotics (ofloxacin, moxifloxacin, azithromycin, erythromycin, clindamycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and tetracycline) against 80 strains of Campylobacter jejuni isolated from children. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by an agar dilution method. Resistance to azithromycin and erythromycin was considered when MIC > or =8 mg/l, to clindamycin when MIC > or =1 mg/l, to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ampicillin when MIC > or =32 mg/l, to ofloxacin and moxifloxacin when MIC > or =4 mg/l, and to tetracycline when MIC > or =16 mg/l. All strains tested were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The lowest frequency of resistance was to azithromycin (2%), erythromycin (3.7%), clindamycin (4.4%) and ampicillin (4.9%), and the highest was to ofloxacin and tetracycline (61.7% for both), and moxifloxacin (37%). Considered the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of infections caused by this microorganism, macrolides showed excellent activity with MIC(90)=0.5 mg/l for azithromycin and MIC(90)=0.5 mg/l for erythromycin.
