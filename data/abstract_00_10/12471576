Although the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli is an emerging problem, limited data are available regarding the frequency of ESBL production in other organisms. We provide the only description of regional occurrence of SHV-7 in Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli or K. pneumoniae in the United States, and we emphasize that, among Enterobacter cloacae strains, not all resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is the result of hyperproduction of AmpC beta-lactamase.
