High dosage of fructose in rats causes insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. This study investigates the effect of physical exercise on oxidant-antioxidant balance in rats fed a high fructose diet, which show characteristic features of insulin resistance. Products of lipid peroxidation and the activity of enzymic antioxidants namely superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione reductase, in red blood cells (RBCs) and liver were assayed. Levels of non-enzymic antioxidants alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid and of protein and non-protein thiols were also determined. The levels of lipid peroxides, diene conjugates, lipofuscin and hydroperoxides were significantly higher in the liver of fructose-fed rats. The RBCs showed significantly higher susceptibility to H(2)O(2)-induced stress compared to control rats. Inadequate antioxidant system was noted in high fructose-fed rats. Physical training to these rats reversed the adverse effects, which could be important in alleviating the pathological consequences of insulin resistance.
