Effect of different antibiotics and standard antibacterial therapy regimes on intestine microflora was investigated. Lincozamides demonstrated the most negative effect. Early addition of probiotics to the treatment with antibacterials had positive effect. Susceptibility of 21 strains of normal microflora to 25 antibiotics was tested. Resistance to antibiotics of lactobacilli varied significantly (more among strains and less among species). It was shown that L. acidophilus (probiotic "Acilact") was resistant to metronidazole only. High resistance to antibiotics was shown for L. plantarum 8RA3, L. fermentum 90T4C (components of probiotic "Lactobacterin"), L. fermentum BL96, L. acidophilus BL and L. acidophilus (component of "Linex"). Susceptibility of microorganisms in complex formulation "Linex" to the modern antibiotics was low. It is concluded that the use of stable antibiotic-resistant strains of normal microflora is favorable as addition to antibiotic therapy.
