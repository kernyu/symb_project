The genetic diversity and in vitro antifungal susceptibility profiles of 55 Candida albicans from immunocompromised patients were studied. PCR based analysis of the transposable intron in the 25S rDNA revealed 39 genotype A, 4 genotype B and 12 genotype C isolates. Serotype analysis categorized 52 isolates as serotype A and 3 as serotype B. All strains were susceptible to micafungin, 5-flucytosine and miconazole, whereas resistance against amphotericin B (3.6%), fluconazole (3.6%), itraconazole (7.3%) and voriconazole (5.5%) was observed. No association was seen between antifungal resistance and genotype/serotype status.
