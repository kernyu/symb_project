BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa can rapidly acquire resistance to antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones and carbapenems. METHODS: We characterized fluoroquinolone, carbapenem and other beta-lactam susceptibilities and analyzed fluoroquinolone and carbapenem resistance in 16 clinical isolates of levofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa. RESULTS: All levofloxacin-resistant isolates showed high MICs (> or =32 microg/ml) for fluoroquinolones including norfloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin and pazufloxacin, whereas the MICs for sitafloxacin were between 2 and 16 microg/ml. These isolates had both a Thr83Ile mutation in GyrA and a Ser87Leu mutation in ParC. An additional mutation, Glu469Asp in GyrB, was detected in 3 isolates. Three of 16 isolates found during antibiotic therapy showed resistance to carbapenems (MIC, 16-32 microg/ml) because of a reduced production of OprD. Fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim were used for 3 months before the isolation of levofloxacin-resistant P.aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Emergence of resistant isolates to both fluoroquinolones and carbapenems during antibiotic therapy is a serious clinical problem. Our results suggest that susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones as well as carbapenems should be monitored during a prolonged course of antibiotic therapy against P. aeruginosa infection.
