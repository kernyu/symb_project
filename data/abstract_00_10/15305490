Primary drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in Poland increased two-fold between 1997 and 2000. Among 3705 drug-resistant strains investigated in 2000, 169 were resistant to streptomycin alone or in combination with isoniazid, rifampicin and/or ethambutol. The molecular basis of streptomycin resistance for 88 (52%) of these strains in comparison with 15 susceptible controls was determined. The most prevalent mutation was the single substitution Lys43Arg in the rpsL gene, found in 30.7% of the strains analysed. However, as many as 51% of the strains investigated carried no mutation in the rpsL or rrs genes. The multiple mutations present in two Beijing family strains were also identified.
