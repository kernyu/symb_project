Pyrosequencing was used to rapidly detect aac(6')-Ib and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes. This plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant is increasing in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. This method is faster and more cost-effective than the methods previously described. Sequences obtained with this pyrosequencing method showed 100% concordance with conventional sequencing.
