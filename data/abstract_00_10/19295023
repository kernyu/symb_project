UNLABELLED: The increasing frequency of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) producing Enterobacteriaceae among nosocomial and community-acquired infections is an important problem for both microbiologists and clinicians, because of the difficulty in correctly detecting, reporting and treating such infections. RESULTS: In the Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases Iasi the most frequent etiological agents of urinary tract infections were: E. coli - 64%, Klebsiella spp. 11% and Enterococcus spp - 5%. The resistance rate of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. was 41% and 60%, respectively to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 29.6% and 72.5%, respectively to third generation cephalosporins, 26% and 24%, respectively to ciprofloxacin. The most active antimicrobial agents against cephalosporins resistant strains of E. coli and Klebsiella spp were carbapenems (susceptibility rate 99% and 94%, respectively) and colimycin (susceptibility rate 89% and 83%, respectively).
