OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study the antimicrobial susceptibilities and molecular epidemiology of Salmonella enterica serotype Derby, a unique and common salmonella serotype in Hong Kong. METHODS: Salmonella Derby strains isolated from stools of patients in a large general hospital in Hong Kong from 1989 to 1994 and from food samples isolated in the Public Health Laboratory were randomly selected and investigated for the antimicrobial susceptibilities by determining the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 19 antimicrobial agents and their relatedness using plasmid analysis, ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and total DNA fingerprinting. RESULTS: About 50% of the 127 isolates studied were susceptible to all the 19 antibiotics tested, although resistance to tetracycline (49%) and sulfamethoxazole (38%) was high. Only 12% did not harbour any detectable plasmids, while the rest contained plasmids in 51 profiles. There were two predominant clones, one comprising of 35% of isolates that could not be pulsotyped because discrete bands were not discernible after PFGE and another comprising 34% of isolates that could be pulsotyped. The remaining 31% belonged to a variety of types. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 70% of S. Derby belonging to two clones were endemic in the community, while the remaining isolates belonged to a variety of types which were probably a result of sporadic infection. The sources of human infections were foods, since most isolates from foods also belonged to the two endemic clones. Typing of S. Derby isolates from other sources such as animals or the environment would help elucidate how foods were contaminated. PFGE might not be universally applicable to all salmonella strains.
