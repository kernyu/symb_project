An observational study assessed the longitudinal use of a new line probe assay for the detection of protease mutations. Probe assays for detection of reverse transcriptase (Inno-LiPA HIV-1 RT; Innogenetics) and protease (prototype kit Inno-LiPA HIV Protease; Innogenetics) mutations gave results for 177 of 199 sequential samples collected over 2 years from 26 patients failing two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and one protease inhibitor (first line: indinavir, n = 6; ritonavir, n = 10; and saquinavir, n = 10). Results were compared to recombinant virus protease inhibitor susceptibility data (n = 87) and to clinical and virological data. Combinations of protease mutations (M46I, G48V, I54V, V82A or -F, I84V, and L90M) predicted phenotypic resistance to the protease inhibitor and to nelfinavir. The sum of protease mutations was associated with virological and clinical outcomes from 6 and 3 months on, respectively. Moreover, a poorer clinical outcome was linked to the sum of reverse transcriptase mutations. In conclusion, despite the limited number of patients studied and the restricted number of codons investigated, probe assay-based genotyping correlates with phenotypic drug resistance and predicts new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stage B and C clinical events and virological outcome. Line probe assays provide additional prognostic information and should be prospectively investigated for their potential for treatment monitoring.
