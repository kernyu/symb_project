BACKGROUND: Maximum suppression of virus replication is often not achievable for persons infected with multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Available data suggest that lamivudine contributes to partial viral suppression, despite the presence of M184V mutations and high-level phenotypic lamivudine resistance. METHODS: Selective lamivudine withdrawal was studied in 6 subjects who had incomplete viral suppression during antiretroviral treatment for multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection. RESULTS: Plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA increased to 0.5 log(10) copies/mL above baseline 6 weeks after the withdrawal of lamivudine treatment (P=.04), even though reversion of lamivudine resistance was not yet detected. Early increases in plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA after lamivudine withdrawal were associated with the presence of the T215Y/F mutation and broad phenotypic resistance to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors at baseline. Genotypic and phenotypic reversion of lamivudine resistance was detected in 4 subjects 8-14 weeks after withdrawal of lamivudine therapy. The duration of lamivudine withdrawal ranged from 8 to 22 weeks; all subjects resumed lamivudine treatment. Plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA were 0.6 log(10) copies/mL above baseline (P=.03) when lamivudine therapy was resumed. After the resumption of lamivudine treatment, plasma HIV RNA levels decreased to baseline levels in 3 subjects but remained elevated in 3 subjects who had evolution of increased antiretroviral drug resistance during the period of lamivudine withdrawal. Safety concerns raised by this latter finding led to permanent closure of the study. CONCLUSIONS: In select cases of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection, lamivudine contributes to suppression of HIV-1 replication, despite the presence of M184V mutations and lamivudine resistance.
