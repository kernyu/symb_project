If diagnosed late, post-surgical pyoderma gangrenosum (PSPG) is a rare, tricky and potentially life-threatening complication. Once diagnosed, immunosuppressive agents may provoke further complications. Well-intentioned extensive serial debridement may cause deep skin and soft-tissue defects, requiring skin grafting and possible flap surgery. The combination of necessary immunosuppressive treatment, protracted hospital stay and broad-spectrum systemic antimicrobial therapy may encourage serious acquired multidrug resistance (MDR). We report an unfortunate triad following breast reconstruction of PSPG, full-thickness chest wall defect and MDR with Acinetobacter baumannii infection. Interdisciplinary treatment using free flap surgery and negative-pressure wound therapy with instillation therapy (V.A.C.Instill(R) Wound Therapy) enabled survival and complete wound closure.
