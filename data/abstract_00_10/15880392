PURPOSE: To compare the utilisation of systemic antimicrobials at the paediatric units of the university hospitals in Marburg (Germany) and Rijeka (Croatia). METHODS: A prospective, observational analysis of hospital records from 300 incident users of antimicrobials in each study centre that were younger than 19 years. Antimicrobial utilisation was analysed in six gender-specific age groups with respect to drug choice, duration of treatment and hospital stay, indication and route of administration. The extent of antimicrobial drug use was assessed by the number of treatment courses. RESULTS: In each hospital, more than 1/3 of the patients were younger than 1 year. The duration of hospital stay was about two-fold longer in Rijeka (18.5 +/- 5.8 days) than in Marburg (8.6 +/- 3.8 days). Pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections were the most common indications in Marburg (38.6%) and Rijeka (58.7%). The cumulative percentage of patients treated with an equal number of different antimicrobials was lower in Rijeka than in Marburg. The most commonly used antimicrobials were ampicillin (40.3%) and cefuroxim (35.9%) in Marburg, but ceftriaxone (43.3%) and cefotaxim (14.0%) in Rijeka. CONCLUSIONS: A shorter treatment duration, less variation in the prescribing pattern and a greater adherence to the use of recommended antimicrobials argue for a more rational antimicrobial drug use in Marburg than in Rijeka. However, a further identification of drug choice determinants is warranted.
