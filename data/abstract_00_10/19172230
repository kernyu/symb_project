An integrative vector was constructed for inserting heterologous genes within a non-functional open reading frame (ORF) on the chromosome of Streptococcus thermophilus. The vector, pINTRS, contained a temperature sensitive origin of replication and an erythromycin resistance gene for initial selection in S. thermophilus. The region of the vector containing unique cloning sites, for insertion of recombinant genes, was flanked by homologous DNA sequences corresponding to a pseudogene in S. thermophilus to facilitate chromosomal integration. The gene encoding green fluorescent protein, regulated by a plasmid borne hsp promoter of S. thermophilus, was cloned into pINTRS to demonstrate proper functioning of the vector.
