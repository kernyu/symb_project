OBJECTIVE: To review the literature summarizing important aspects of infection control in the critical care setting and to provide recommendations to reduce infections with resistant bacteria in the intensive care unit. DATA SOURCE: Computer searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. DATA: The frequency of antibiotic-resistant, health care-associated infections has increased every year for the past 2 decades. Infections with antibiotic-resistant organisms have been linked to increases in morbidity, length of hospitalization, increased healthcare costs, and increased mortality. A comprehensive approach is necessary to prevent antimicrobial resistance in ICUs. This includes (1) preventing infections; (2) diagnosing and treating infections appropriately; (3) using antimicrobials wisely; and (4) preventing transmission. CONCLUSIONS: The reservoirs for antibiotic-resistant organisms are colonized patients, and the vectors are often healthcare workers. This places an enormous responsibility on healthcare providers to protect their patients. Clinicians must recognize the importance of adhering to the recommendations in the Centers for Disease Control's Campaign to Prevent Antimicrobial Resistance in the healthcare setting.
