The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program is a global, longitudinal antimicrobial resistance surveillance network of greater than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum agents. Between 1999 and 2002, 15 US medical centers referred up to 200 nonduplicate isolates from clinical infections to a central processing laboratory. During this 4-year period, the antimicrobial activity of 11 broad-spectrum agents was assessed against 5389 bacterial isolates using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards)-recommended methods with interpretive criteria. Analysis of the MIC results for pathogens isolated from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) were compared to results from pathogens isolated in non-ICU settings. Among Enterobacteriaceae (3884 strains), the carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) demonstrated the highest susceptibility rates (> or =98.7%) and with only a 1% increase in resistance for ICU isolates compared to non-ICU organisms. Other antimicrobial agents tested demonstrated consistently higher susceptibility rates against Enterobacteriaceae isolates from ICU (89.7-98.7%) and non-ICU (93.2-99.9%) areas. For the nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli, the rank order of the most active agents having lowest percentage resistance rates were tobramycin (15.5%) < cefepime < imipenem < piperacillin/tazobactam < ceftazidime < meropenem (21.9%) for ICU isolates, and meropenem (7.8%) < cefepime < imipenem < piperacillin/tazobactam < ceftazidime < tobramycin (12.9%) among non-ICU strains. All tested agents showed lower susceptibility rates (range, 1.0-15.3%) and higher resistance rates (range, 0.1-15.1%) for both Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli among the ICU isolates compared to the non-ICU isolates (except for ciprofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae). Continued surveillance of these broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents in both ICU and general hospital wards appears warranted to monitor the occurrence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens causing serious infections in these care areas and the possible emergence of resistance mechanisms that could compromise empiric carbapenem therapy.
