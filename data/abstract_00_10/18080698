Tuberculosis pertains to every third HIV-positive person in a world. Therefore HIV infection is considered the most evident risk factor for the primary tuberculosis or relapse of latent tubercular infection. Pulmonary tuberculosis is the most frequent clinical presentation in HIV-positive individuals, although the frequency of extrapulmonary tuberculosis is increasing with the CD4+ count reduction. Tuberculin skin testing and bacteriological tests are regarded as a "gold standard" of diagnosis. Molecular diagnostics and evaluation of a whole-blood interferon-gamma release assay for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are not cost-effective therefore their application is limited. DOTS programs are recommended for the antimycobacterial treatment in HIV-infected patients. The increasing drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (multi-drug resistant tuberculosis--MDRTB) is emerging problem in the field of tuberculosis management.
