Our point-prevalence survey followed an outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a long-term care facility and identified five MRSA strains, of which two possessed an outbreak genotype not encountered previously and three had another profile. All of them possessed SCCmec type V. Six methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strains were genotypically related to the epidemic strains.
