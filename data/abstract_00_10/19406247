The susceptibility trends for all anaerobes processed by the Anaerobe Reference Laboratory against various antibiotics were determined by using data for 2557 isolates referred by all government hospitals in Kuwait from 2002 to 2007. MIC were determined for the following anti-anaerobic antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, imipenem, meropenem, metronidazole, penicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin (for Gram-positive anaerobes only), using E-test method. The commonest isolates were Bacteroides fragilis (36.8%), followed by Peptostreptococcus spp. (21.9%), Bacteroides ovatus (15.5%) and Prevotella bivia (12.1%). In addition, Prevotella oralis and other Bacteroides spp. represented 8.5% and 8.1% of total number of isolates, respectively. Resistance rate varied among the antimicrobial agents and the species tested. The beta-lactams, with the exception of penicillin, were the most active drugs. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the only antimicrobial agent to which all the isolates were uniformly susceptible. Imipenem and metronidazole were highly active with resistance rate of only <5% recorded against most isolates. However, 42.8, 55.8 and 9.3% of Clostridium difficile isolates were resistant to imipenem, clindamycin and meropenem, respectively. It is noteworthy that from 2002 to 2007, there was a gradual increase in resistance rates to clindamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin among B. fragilis. Periodic surveillance of antibiotic resistance among the anaerobic bacteria is recommended as a guide to empiric antibiotic use and formulation of guideline for appropriate choice of antimicrobial therapy in anaerobic infections.
