In this study, we report the synthesis and antimicrobial evaluation of several new 4-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzamides (11-30) and 5-chloro-1-(p-fluorobenzyl)-2-{4-[(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)carbonyl]phenyl}-1H-ben zimidazole (33). Compound 20 exhibited the best antibacterial activity with MIC value of 6.25 microg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Significant antifungal activities were obtained with the compounds 13, 14, 18, 19, and 33 with MIC values of 3.12 microg/mL which are close to fluconazole.
