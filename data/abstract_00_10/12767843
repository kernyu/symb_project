The aim of this study was to investigate TEM-24-producing isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and their clonal dissemination in Nice University Hospital. During the 1994-2000 period, a total of 263 non-repetitive isolates of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae were collected. Most of these isolates were highly resistant in vitro to ceftazidime, cefotaxime and aztreonam, but susceptible to cefoxitin and imipenem. Resistance profile analysis revealed seven predominant antibiotypes (P1 to P7). Isoelectric focusing evidenced beta-lactamase activity, with a chromosomal penicillinase (pl 7.7), and one or two additional enzymes with pls ranging from 5.4 to 8.2 identified as presumed TEM-1 pl 5.4, TEM-3 pl 6.3, TEM-24 pl 6.5, SHV-3 pl 7.0, SHV-4 pl 7.8, SHV-5 pl 8.2, or other unidentified beta-lactamases. Among these K. pneumoniae, 130 isolates produced TEM-24, and 115 of them were highly resistant in vitro to quinolones (antibiotype P1). This phenotype was responsible for an outbreak in a medical intensive care unit from March to September 2000. Four isolates submitted were genetical sequenced, and shared 99.9% homology with tem-24 (GenBank no. X 65253). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (ERIC2-PCR) applied to 28 non-epidemic and six epidemic isolates yielded concordant results. Molecular typing revealed the persistence and dissemination of a single clone of TEM-24 producing K. pneumoniae in Nice Hospital during the seven-year study period.
