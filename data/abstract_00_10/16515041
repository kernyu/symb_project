A series of new 5-alkynyl-2'-deoxyuridines have been synthesized and their antiherpetic activity was tested in the cultured Vero cells on a model of herpes simplex virus type 1, including its acyclovir-resistant strains. Some test compounds were found to have a significant specific antiherpetic activity. Nucleoside XIV showed the greatest activity. Compounds IV and X also has displayed a significant activity against the herpes simplex virus type 1 strain that is highly resistant to acyclovir. Examining the combined action of substance II with acyclovir and ganciclovir has revealed a synergetic effect.
