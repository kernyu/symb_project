Chemotherapy is central to the control of many parasite infections of both medical and veterinary importance. However, control has been compromised by the emergence of drug resistance in several important parasite species. Such parasites cover a broad phylogenetic range and include protozoa, helminths and arthropods. In order to achieve effective parasite control in the future, the recognition and diagnosis of resistance will be crucial. This demand for early, accurate diagnosis of resistance to specific drugs in different parasite species can potentially be met by modern molecular techniques. This paper summarises the resistance status of a range of important parasites and reviews the available molecular techniques for resistance diagnosis. Opportunities for applying successes in some species to other species where resistance is less well understood are explored. The practical application of molecular techniques and the impact of the technology on improving parasite control are discussed.
