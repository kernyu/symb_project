OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activity of old and newer antianaerobic drugs against clinical isolates of Bacteroides fragilis group strains from different parts of Europe. METHODS: Bacteroides fragilis group isolates from 37 laboratories in 19 countries were biochemically characterized. The MICs of seven antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method as recommended by the NCCLS. Production of beta-lactamase was detected by nitrocefin. RESULTS: There were 1284 B. fragilis group isolates included in the study. Abdominal infections and wounds were the most common sources of isolation and B. fragilis was the dominating species. Ninety-nine percent of the strains were resistant to ampicillin (breakpoint 2 mg/L), 6% to cefoxitin (64 mg/L), 15% to clindamycin (8 mg/L) and 9% to moxifloxacin (8 mg/L). Less than 1% were resistant to imipenem (16 mg/L), piperacillin-tazobactam (128 mg/L) and metronidazole (32 mg/L). Ninety-six percent of the isolates were beta-lactamase producers. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance among the B. fragilis group is increasing.
