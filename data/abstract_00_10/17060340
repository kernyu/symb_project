OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of fusidic acid resistance, mediated by the fusB gene, among coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) isolated from bovine mastitis. METHODS: A total of 113 CoNS isolates were screened for susceptibility to fusidic acid by using a disc diffusion method. The fusB gene was detected by using PCR and subsequent DNA sequencing. The localization of fusB was determined by hybridization. RESULTS: The fusB gene was detected in 3 of 11 fusidic acid-resistant bovine CoNS isolates. The organization of the fusB downstream region on a 40 kb plasmid in a Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolate (288/96) was highly similar to the previously reported organization of fusB on plasmid pUB101 from a Staphylococcus aureus isolate of human origin. The fusB gene was chromosomally located in the remaining two isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Fusidic acid resistance mediated by fusB is not the dominant resistance mechanism in fusidic acid-resistant CoNS studied in this work. The similarity between the organization of the fusB downstream region in S. haemolyticus (isolate 288/96) and on plasmid pUB101 from an S. aureus isolate of human origin indicates a common ancestral origin of these genes.
