Because gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a motility disorder, acid reduction with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) remains a symptomatic therapy with a recurrence rate of over 90% after discontinuation of acid suppression. This "therapeutic dilemma" becomes obvious in patients not responding sufficiently to the conventional medication (therapy resistance, necessity of high PPI doses, volume reflux). In this manuscript we analyze additional factors that may play a role in the pathogenesis and interpretation of GERD. These additional factors include gastroesophageal motility and esophageal barrier functions as well as duodenogastroesophageal reflux and Helicobacter pylori infection. In addition, basic problems in interpretation of therapeutic success such as placebo effect, spontaneous remission of GERD, the role of sensory function and subjective interpretation of symptoms and the overlap between physiological and pathological reflux as well as functional disorders will be discussed.
