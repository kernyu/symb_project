The management of genital herpes in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) differs from that in individuals with genital herpes because of the significant interaction between the two viruses involved. HIV-induced immunodeficiency increases the frequency and severity of recurrent anogenital herpes simplex virus (HSV) shedding and disease as well as the risk of developing drug-resistant HSV infection. HSV infection, in turn, increases HIV replication and the risk of HIV transmission. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy has facilitated therapy for genital herpes, but important unanswered questions remain about the optimal therapy of drug-sensitive and -resistant genital herpes and the role of antiherpes drugs in reducing HIV disease progression and the risk of HIV transmission.
