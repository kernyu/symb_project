HBV genotypes were investigated in sera/plasma from 97 HBV positive subjects. Genotype D was revealed in 80.4% followed by E in 6.2%. Genotypes A, B, and C were also found, as well as for the first time a new combination of HBV D and G genotypes. In a cohort of subjects of this population, the relationship with lamivudine and/or famciclovir-resistant HBV mutants was also investigated. Among 12 untreated subjects, 25% carried HBV drug-resistant strains suggesting that drug-resistant variants naturally exist in untreated Italian HBV chronically infected subjects.
