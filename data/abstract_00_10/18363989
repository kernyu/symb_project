OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: 1) A prospective study to determine in vitro concentrations for a range of fluoroquinolones, gentamicin and amoxycillin-clavulanate required to inhibit growth of recently collected, feline and canine Escherichia coli and canine Staphylococcus intermedius isolates. 2) A comparative retrospective study to compare the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and amoxycillin-clavulanate for archived canine E coli and S intermedius isolates collected ten to twenty years earlier, with those for recently collected isolates. PROCEDURE: Susceptibility was assessed using disk diffusion, agar dilution susceptibility testing and Epsilometer tests (E-tests) for both recently collected and archived isolates. RESULTS: All feline E coli isolates and recently collected canine S intermedius isolates were susceptible to all fluoroquinolones. There was a statistically significant increase in the MIC range of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin for recently collected E coli, and in the MIC range of amoxycillin-clavulanate for recently collected S intermedius isolates compared to archived isolates. Twelve of 59 recently collected canine E coli isolates were resistant to both ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin. Resistant canine E coli isolates were associated with complicating host or infection site factors. CONCLUSION: This is the first report comparing the MICs for all veterinary fluoroquinolones currently available in Australia for a representative sample of canine and feline E coli and canine S intermedius isolates. Importantly, this study identified 12 of 59 canine E coli isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones and identified the development of low level resistance in canine E coli to ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin and canine S intermedius to amoxycillin-clavulanate.
