High-level resistance to ertapenem was produced by beta-lactamases of groups 1, 2f, and 3 in a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae deficient in Omp35 and Omp36. From a wild-type strain producing ACT-1 beta-lactamase, ertapenem-resistant mutants for which the ertapenem MICs were up to 128 microg/ml and expression of outer membrane proteins was diminished could be selected.
