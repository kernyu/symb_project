A survey has been carried out in south-west of Cote d'Ivoire in order to study chloroquine resistance in treatment of malaria according to 14 days protocol of WHO (World Health Organisation) (1996) for evaluation of antimalarial drugs activity; 63 children, aged from 6 months to 15 years and suffering from noncomplicated malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum, received by oral way 25 mg/kg of chloroquine over three days (10-10-5). During the survey, they were subjected to a clinic and parasitologic (thick and thin blood film) follow up. We obtained, for 51 children (81%), a satisfactory clinical answer, for 8 children (13%) an early therapeutic failure and for the other 4 (6%) a late therapeutic failure. Moreover, we obtained 40% of failure in children of less than 24 months old, 25% between 24 months and 59 months and 7% beyond 6 years old.
