Information about gp41 variability across distinct HIV-1 subtypes is scarce, and yet such knowledge would be desirable for designing new drugs targeting this viral protein. Conserved gp41 residues in viruses derived from 79 individuals infected with distinct HIV-1 subtypes (29 A, 25 B, 8 C, 3 D, 4 F, 4 G, 2 H, 1 J, 1 U, and 2 CRF06_cpx) and naive for entry inhibitors were examined. Conservation of gp41 was also examined in 908, 56, and 3 HIV-1 group M, O, and N sequences, respectively, available at the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database. Among the 345 residues in the full gp41 protein, 36% showed up to 90% conservation in all 987 group M sequences, as did 40% of 56 group O sequences and 49% of 3 group N sequences. The HR1 region (residues 29-82) showed a higher proportion of highly conserved residues than did the HR2 region (residues 116-161) in all groups (65 vs. 34% in group M, 57 vs. 46% in group O, and 80 vs. 52% in group N). Some secondary resistance mutations to enfuvirtide were found as natural polymorphisms (A30V and Q56K/R in group M, Q56R and S138A in group O, and S138A in group N). In fact, A30V was a signature change in clade G and CRF06_cpx, whereas Q56K/R was a signature change for clades A and J, as well as for CRF04_cpx, CRF09_cpx, CRF11_cpx, and CRF13_cpx. The relative conservation of amino acids in gp41 across HIV-1 variants indirectly highlights the critical role of this protein for HIV infectivity and makes it feasible to design new entry inhibitors with activity against diverse HIV-1 variants.
