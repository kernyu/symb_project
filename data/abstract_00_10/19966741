Healthcare interventions can be episodic, and a target-based culture can lead to clinicians focusing on treating and discharging a person in a certain time frame to meet targets. When health care is delivered in pressurized acute environments, a holistic approach to a person's health may be lost. Urinary tract infection is the most common healthcare-acquired infection in the UK, and treatment in an acute setting may be episodic. This case study of an 85-year-old female with a urinary tract infection illustrates how viewing each episode of care in isolation can lead to sub-optimal care that does not address the underlying causes of problems. Drawing on the evidence regarding best practice in diagnosis, treatment and prevention of urinary tract infection, it shows how holistic evidence-based care can address underlying problems, reduce the risk of infection and adverse events, provide high quality care and deliver successful patient outcomes.
