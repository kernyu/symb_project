OBJECTIVE: To survey food borne pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in China. METHODS: A total of 4034 samples of foods (raw meats, raw milk, cooked meats, ice cream, yoghurt, aquatic product and vegetable) were examined for the presence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 Salmonella spp and Listeria monocytogens by national active foodborne pathogens surveillance system. The samples were obtained from 11 provinces in 2001. RESULTS: Approximate 5.50% of the all samples yielded 3 pathogenes, whereas Escherichia coli O157:H7 (0.82%), Salmonella servoars (3.32%) and Listeria monocytogens (1.29%). The most heavy contamination by three food borne pathogens are in raw meat (12.96%). Top seven serotype of the 137 Salmonella isolates are S. derby, S. agona, S. enteritidis, S. reading, S. anatum. S. muenster, S. typhimurium. CONCLUSION: Serotypes and antibiotic resistance patterns of Salmonella isolates are different in 11 provinces. E. coli O157:H7 strains that are isolated from raw meat and cooked meat have VT2, eae, Hly genes. Salmonella and E. coli strains of multidrug resistance were isolated and identified.
