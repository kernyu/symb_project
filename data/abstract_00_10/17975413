PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Around 10% of individuals infected with HIV suffer from chronic hepatitis B virus infection. This represents at least 4 million people worldwide. HIV infection modifies the course of hepatitis B virus associated liver disease with faster progression to cirrhosis. The number of anti-hepatitis B virus drugs has increased within the last few years, and some of them also exert activity against HIV-1. The aim of this article is to update the current knowledge on antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B in HIV-infected patients. RECENT FINDINGS: In the absence of successful anti-hepatitis B virus therapy, morbidity and mortality associated with liver disease are increased in hepatitis B virus/HIV coinfected individuals. Data derived from studies using new more potent anti-hepatitis B virus drugs are very promising, and strategies to use these antivirals sequentially and/or in combination are being developed. Hopefully, this success will help bring a halt to liver-related complications and death in the hepatitis B virus/HIV coinfected population. SUMMARY: Appropriate diagnosis and monitoring of chronic hepatitis B, including the use of noninvasive tools for assessing liver fibrosis, measurement of serum hepatitis B virus-DNA, and drug resistance testing, along with wise use of antivirals may convert hepatitis B virus/HIV coinfection into a manageable disease.
