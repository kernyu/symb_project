Six new poly-O-acylated jatrophane diterpenes (1- 6) have been isolated along with five known compounds from the white latex of Pedilanthus tithymaloides. The structural identification was accomplished on the basis of 2D NMR and MS investigations. Some of these highly oxygenated jatrophane diterpenes possess a rare O-acetyl enol moiety. Compounds 1 and 3- 5 showed antiplasmodial activity with IC(50) values of 3.4-4.4 microg/mL and antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis with minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values ranging from 12.5 to 100 microg/mL.
