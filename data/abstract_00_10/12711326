Thiazolidinediones acting as PPAR-gamma agonists are a new generation of oral antidiabetics addressing insulin resistance as a main feature of type-2 diabetes. In accordance to our results, pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that the thiazolinedione troglitazone prevents the development of insulin-dependent autoimmune type-1 diabetes. To investigate whether TGZ acts by affecting the ICAM-1/LFA-1 pathway and/or the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance in NOD mice, we analysed the IL-1beta-induced ICAM-1 expression on islet-cells and the LFA-1, CD25, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 expression on splenocytes. After 200 days of oral TGZ administration, islet cells from TGZ-treated NOD mice showed a reduced ICAM-1 expression in response to the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta. The expression of the ligand LFA-1 on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells was comparable to that of placebo- and untreated controls. Also, the expression of Th1/Th2 cytokines was comparable in groups receiving TGZ or Placebo. Nevertheless, the investigated NOD mice segregated into IFN-gamma low- and IFN-gamma high producers as revealed by cluster analysis. Interestingly, the majority of TGZ-treated mice belonged to the cluster of IFN-gamma low producers. Thus, the prevention of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice by TGZ seems to be associated with suppression of IL-1beta-induced ICAM-1 expression leading to a reduced vulnerability of pancreatic beta-cells during the effector stage of beta-cell destruction. In addition, IFN-gamma production was modulated, implicating that alteration of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance might have contributed to diabetes prevention. The findings of this study suggest that TGZ exerts its effects by influencing both the beta-cells as the target of autoimmune beta-cell destruction and the T-cells as major effectors of the autoimmune process.
