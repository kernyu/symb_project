Improved clinical outcome, patient safety, cost savings and a reduction in the burden of antimicrobial resistance are outcomes associated with optimizing antimicrobial use. Despite this, the misuse of antimicrobials in the hospital setting remains a huge problem. The development of antimicrobial management teams and the promotion of the role of the clinical pharmacist in antimicrobial prescribing are recommended strategies for improving prescribing practice. It is recognized that there is a lack of published evidence-based research looking at the effects of antimicrobial control programmes and there is a need for more data. In the UK, the role of the hospital pharmacist in promoting responsible antimicrobial prescribing has been largely undervalued and needs to be encouraged and formalized in line with current directives. Managerial structures within hospitals need to endorse multidisciplinary antimicrobial management schemes with appropriate authoritative, administrative and information technology support.
