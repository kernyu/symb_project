In spite of advances in microbiological and serological investigations over the last two decades, etiological attribution remains difficult in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Even after exhaustive investigation, the etiology of CAP remains unknown in up to 50% of patients. Common pathogens include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. In addition, several investigators document the importance of atypical pathogens including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila in the etiology of CAP in the GCC region. Increasingly, other etiologies, particularly influenza viruses, varicella zoster virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have been recognized as causative pathogens of CAP within the region. Rates of antimicrobial resistance of S. pneumoniae and other pathogens are rising in the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) region and susceptibility profiles of antibiotics against intracellular pathogens such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are not routinely performed. Injudicious prescribing and over-use of antibiotics drive much resistance. The GCC CAPWG calls for urgent governmental regulations to limit and monitor antibiotic prescription in the GCC region.
