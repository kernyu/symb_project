For 31 clinical strains of S. aureus the correlation between phenotype and genotype of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins B (MLSB) was established.. Phenotypes were determined on the basis of: susceptibility to erythromycin and clindamycin and the ability to an induction of the resistance (phenotypes S, susceptible; R , constitutive resistant, D, resistant after induction with erythromycin, D+, resistant after induction with erythromycin and with a presence of the small colonies inside inhibition zone between erythromycin and clindamycin discs), and on the basis of the resistance to spectinomycin (spR, resistant, spS, susceptible). Among examined S. aureus strains eight phenotypes of resistance to MLSB were recognized (the corresponding genotypes are given in brackets). Six phenotypes were typical: SspS (lack of MLS-B resistance genes), NEGspS (msrA/B, 1 strain), D+spS (ermCi, 4 strains),. DspR (ermAi, 11 strains and ermAi + msrA/B, 2 strains), RspR (ermAc, 4 strains and ermA + msrA/B,1 strain and ermA + ermC, 1 strain) and RspS (ermCc, 6 strains and ermB, 1 strain). Two rare phenotypes in two single strains were observed: SspR (ermAi, the strain with altered inducibility, inductor other than erythromycin) and DspS (ermAi, presumably mutation or lack of spc in Tn554).
