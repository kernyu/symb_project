Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection leads to long-term sequelae such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Antiviral therapy aims at controlling the viral replication and thus, decreasing the likelihood of such complications. In this study, we evaluated the dynamics of biochemical and virological parameters over 10 years of antiviral therapy in a Thai patient with chronic HBeAg-negative HBV infection, who had relapsed after two courses of interferon alfa treatment. Lamivudine administration initially led to a significant reduction in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and HBV DNA levels, but a subsequent emergence of YIDD mutants caused an ALT flare and a virus breakthrough. A 4-log HBV DNA decrease and normalization of the ALT level were achieved within 3 months of adefovir monotherapy without any relapse during follow-up exceeding 20 months. Thus, careful monitoring during treatment and knowledge of cross-resistance to antiviral salvage therapy are crucial for the management of patients with chronic hepatitis B.
