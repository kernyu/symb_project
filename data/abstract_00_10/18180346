Broth microdilution was used to determine the MICs of AR-709 and comparator antimicrobial agents for 224 invasive multidrug-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. AR-709 was highly active, with a MIC 50 of 0.25 microg/ml, a MIC 90 of 0.5 microg/ml, and a range of <or=0.008 microg/ml to 1 microg/ml.
