A pepper gene, CABPR1, which encodes basic pathogenesis-related protein 1, has been reported to be strongly induced after ethephon treatment, wounding, and tobacco mosaic virus infection. The potential role of CABPR1 in tolerance of biotic or abiotic stresses was examined in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum cv. xanthi plants. Overexpression of CABPR1 in tobacco plants enhanced tolerance not only to heavy metal stresses, but also to the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora nicotianae, and the bacterial pathogens Ralstonia solanacearum and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci. RT-PCR revealed that the CABPR1 transgene increased expression of the PR-Q and glutathione S-transferase genes, but decreased expression of the PR-1a and thaumatin genes. Moreover, these transgenic lines exhibited significant decreases in total peroxidase activity and transcription level, suggesting that overexpression of CABPR1 in tobacco cells altered the balance of redox systems. Redox imbalance in transgenic lines may lead to H(2)O(2) accumulation, triggering tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses.
