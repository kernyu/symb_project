The antimicrobial susceptibility of 296 invasive neonatal group B streptococcus isolates from a nationwide 2-year surveillance study in Germany was investigated. All isolates were susceptible to beta-lactams, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and vancomycin. Erythromycin and clindamycin resistance was found in 10.1 and 5.7%, respectively. The ermB, ermTR, or mefA gene was detected in all but one of the erythromycin-resistant isolates.
