Prevention of candidemia has been difficult and empirical therapy may eventually reduce morbidity and mortality. Successful empirical therapies depend on understanding of fungal features and antifungal agents. Susceptibility to amphotericin B (AMPH-B), flucytosine (5-FC), fluconazole (FLCZ), itraconazole (ITCZ), miconazole (MCZ), and micafungin (MCFG) of 41 Candida species isolated from blood were determined. Candida albicans was the most common species (23 species), followed by C. parapsilosis (5 species), C. tropicalis (4 species), C. glabrata (3 species), C. guilliermondii (2 species), C. krusei (1 specie), and Candida spp (3 species). The isolation rates of the drug-resistant (DR) fungi were 5% for 5-FC. The rates of DR and susceptible dose dependent (S-DD) fungi were 0% and 2% for FLCZ, respectively. The rates of DR and S-DD fungi were 0% and 17% for ITCZ, respectively. No shift to resistant species in C. albicans occurred in our hospitals. All C. albicans were susceptible for the antifungal agents examined.
