BACKGROUND: To observe the effects of short-term antibiotic treatment in patients with hepatic failure and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). METHODS: In this prospective study short-term antibiotic treatment was given to 67 cases diagnosed as hepatic failure with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Ceftriaxone 2 g, iv drip, q12h for 10 d or ofloxacin 0.2 g, iv drip, q12h for 10 d was given to the patients at random and the efficacy was evaluated on the basis of clinical symptoms, medical examination and ascites after 3, 7, 10 days of therapy. RESULTS: Seven cases (10.44%) were cured and 57 cases (85%) were improved after 3 days therapy, the total effective rate was 95.52%, but in 3 cases the therapy had no effect. The results of ascites bacterial culture and drug susceptibility test showed that one case had drug resistance to ceftriaxone and two cases had drug resistance to ofloxacin, so antibiotics were changed in time. After 7 days therapy, the results showed that 65 cases (97.01%) cured and 2 cases (2.99%) were improved, the total effective rate was 100%. When the therapy lasted for 10 days, all patients were cured. One patient had oral mucous membrane. Candida albicans infection after 3 days therapy; two cases got thrush and one patient got fungal intestinal infection after 7 days therapy; when the therapy lasted for 10 days, 4 cases had thrush and 2 cases had fungal infection of intestines and one patient had pulmonary fungal infection. CONCLUSION: The optimal period of antibiotic treatment of hepatic failure with SBP should be from 7 days to 10 days.
