For six clinical isolates of Chlamydia trachomatis, in vitro susceptibility to erythromycin, azithromycin, and josamycin has been determined. Four isolates were resistant to all the antibiotics and had the mutations A2058C and T2611C (Escherichia coli numbering) in the 23S rRNA gene. All the isolates had mixed populations of bacteria that did and did not carry 23S rRNA gene mutations.
