OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiological pattern, clinical picture, the recent trends of multidrug-resistant typhoid fever (MDRTF), and therapeutic response of ofloxacin and ceftriaxone in MDRTF. METHODS: The present prospective randomized controlled parallel study was conducted on 93 blood culture-proven Salmonella typhi children. All MDRTF cases were randomized to treatment with ofloxacin or ceftriaxone. RESULTS: Of 93 children, 62 (66.6%) were MDRTF. 24 cases were below 5 years, 26 between 5-10 years and 12 were above 10 years. Male to female ratio was 1.85: 1. Majority of cases came from lower middle socio-economic classes with poor personal hygiene. Fever was the main presenting symptom. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly was present in 88% and 46% cases respectively. 19 (30.6%) cases developed complications. Mean defervescence time with ceftriaxone and ofloxacin was 4.258 and 4.968 days respectively. CONCLUSION: MDRTF is still emerging as serious public and therapeutic challenge. Ceftriaxone is well-tolerated and effective drug but expensive whereas ofloxacin is safe, cost-effective and therapeutic alternative in treatment of MDRTF in children with comparable efficacy to ceftriaxone.
