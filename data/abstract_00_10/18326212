In the past 5 years, there has been a rise in the number of patients with new-onset drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis from 32.3% to 44.0%. The pattern of primary resistance is marked by an increase in the proportion of multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) strains, by the steady-state level of their isolation, and by a reduction in the detection rate of unidrug resistant strains. The efficiency of treatment in pulmonary tuberculosis patients with primary MBT resistance depends on patient compliance. After 3-year follow-up, death occurred in 12.2% of the patients, the tuberculous process became chronic in 31.7%, and there was a relapse in 9.8%. The drug resistance of the causative agent affects the duration of disability due to tuberculosis to a greater extent than does multidrug resistance.
