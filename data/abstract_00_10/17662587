Hygromycin B resistance was transferred to the sterile mycelia of Cadophora finlandia and Phialocephala fortinii by co-cultivation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Constitutively expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) was also introduced using the same vector. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) revealed strong fluorescence of transformants. Both traits were mitotically stable during one year of subculturing on non-selective growth medium. Southern blot analysis showed that the majority of the transformants contained single-copy integrations at random sites in the genome.
