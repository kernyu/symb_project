The purpose of the work was to study rifampicin- and izoniazid-resistent strains of M. tuberculosis, circulating in Western Siberia, by VNTR and IS6110 typing. The authors also studied genetic causes of resistance to these antibiotics and undertook a search of new VNTR loci, displaying polymorphism in genomes of closely related clonally-disseminated variants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in W-Beijing family model analysis.
