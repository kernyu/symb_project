Danish nationwide surveillance data on invasive pneumococcal disease from the 5-year period from 1995 to 1999, including 5,452 isolates, are presented and described. Annual overall incidence rates, serotype distribution, and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the isolates were monitored. Major changes in the total annual incidence rate from 27/100,000 in 1996 to 17/100,000 in 1999 and a significant change in the proportion of invasive isolates belonging to types 1 and 12F were observed. The serotype coverage rate by the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine among the elderly was 92.9%, and the serotype coverage rate by the 7-, 9-, and 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines among children less than 2 years old were 71.7, 75.2, and 81.4%, respectively. Invasive isolates with reduced susceptibility to penicillin or erythromycin increased from 1995 to 1999, with a high proportion of the penicillin-nonsusceptible invasive isolates originating from people 60 years old or older (57.0%). These observations underline the importance of adequate surveillance systems of invasive pneumococcal disease to introduce and maintain national vaccine strategies and adequate antibiotic policy.
