Given the increasing incidence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the recent emergence of MRSA with a reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, alternative approaches to the treatment of infection are of increasing relevance. The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the effect of IFN-gamma on the ability of white blood cells to kill S. aureus and to develop a simpler, higher throughput bacterial killing assay. Using a methicillin sensitive clinical isolate of S. aureus, a clinical isolate of MRSA, and a commercially available strain of MRSA, studies were conducted using a killing assay in which the bacteria were added directly into whole blood. The viability of the bacteria in samples harvested at various time points was then evaluated both by the classic CFU assay and by a new assay using alamarBlue. In the latter method, serially diluted samples and a standard curve containing known concentrations of bacteria were placed on 96-well plates, and alamarBlue was added. Fluorescence readings were taken, and the viability of the bacteria in the samples was calculated using the standard curve. The results of these studies demonstrated that the CFU and alamarBlue methods yielded equivalent detection of bacteria diluted in buffer. For samples incubated in whole blood, however, the alamarBlue method tended to yield lower viabilities than the CFU method due to the emergence of a slower growing subpopulation of S. aureus upon incubation in the blood matrix. A significant increase in bacterial killing was observed upon pretreatment of whole blood for 24 h with 5 or 25 ng/ml IFN-gamma. This increase in killing was detected equivalently by the CFU and alamarBlue methods. In summary, these studies describe a method that allows for the higher throughput analysis of the effects of immunomodulators on bacterial killing.
