BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Uropathogenic Escherichia coli have virulence properties, that are absent in non pathogenic E. coli. The distribution of these markers can vary according to patient populations. Hence, a study was undertaken to describe the presence of virulence factors like Pfimbriae, type 1 fimbriae and haemolysin in E.coli causing urinary infections in three groups of patients. Antibiogram was also recorded to determine differences, if any, between the groups. METHODS: E. coli isolated from three groups of subjects, in counts of >10(5) CFU/ml and in pure growth were tested for mannose resistant haemagglutination (MRHA) to indicate P fimbriae and mannose sensitive haemagglutination (MSHA) to indicate type 1 fimbriae. Haemolysin production and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were also recorded. RESULTS: Significantly more isolates from antenatal and postnatal women possessed P fimbriae compared to groups with urologic abnormalities (P=0.05). Haemolysin production was also significantly higher (P<0.001) in this group. Greater proportions of isolates from pregnant women were susceptible to commonly used antimicrobials. However, resistance to third generation cephalosporins was present even in these isolates from community infections. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: In patients with urological abnormality, E. coli with lower virulence can cause infections. Isolates from these patients exhibited greater drug resistance. In pregnant women and in community acquired infections, simple antimicrobial drugs like nitrofurantoin might still be useful. However, urgent and stringent policies for antimicrobial use and infection control in hospitals are required in India.
