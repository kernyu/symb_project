AIM: In the present study we report the clinical outcome of 27 patients with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) undergoing autologous peripheral stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). METHODS: On transplant, 18 patients had sensitive disease (SD) and 9 resistant disease (RD). The median time between diagnosis and ASCT was 18 months (range, 7 to 96 months). The conditioning consisted of BEAM regimen. RESULTS: The 100-day mortality rate was 3%. Three months after transplant, 12 patients transplanted with SD were in complete remission (CR) and only one of the 9 patients transplanted with RD achieved CR. Overall survival and disease-free survival after 3 years were 68% and 60%, respectively. CONCLUSION: the present results confirm the efficacy and safety of the ASCT in refractory or relapsed HL patients with SD. Other strategies should be investigated for patients with RD.
