An in vitro test for the detection of ivermectin sensitivity of Strongyloides stercoralis in human clinical specimens was developed. The test has a simple procedure that combines parasite culture with a drug assay. It is based on the principle of the drug effect on larval development test, combined with a modified coproculture using the filter paper culture technique. This does not require parasite isolation, and drug sensitivity can be shown in relationship to the dose. This test can be applied in field surveys for anthelmintic sensitivity and for appropriate drug rotation strategies when drug resistance occurs.
