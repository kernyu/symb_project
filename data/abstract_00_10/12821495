We compared the activities of telithromycin, erythromycin, azithromycin, josamycin, penicillin G, amoxicillin, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone against invasive and noninvasive non-penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates recovered from children. Of the 186 isolates tested, 89% were positive for erm(B) by PCR. Telithromycin had the lowest MICs, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited of 0.032 and 0.25 micro g/ml for erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant isolates, respectively.
