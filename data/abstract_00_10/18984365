Resistance to topical antibiotics is increasingly relevant in dermatology. This article discusses emerging patterns of resistance and the implications for clinical practice. Emergence of resistance is complicating decolonization of the skin and nares in patients infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In the setting of acne treatment, adding topical benzoyl peroxide has been shown to reduce the emergence of strains resistant to topical antibiotics. Other agents, such as zinc salts, are promising in this regard. This article discusses alternatives to antibiotics and mechanisms to stem the emergence of resistance.
