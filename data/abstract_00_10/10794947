Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from animal origin in France is organised by the French Agency for Food Safety (Agence Francaise de Securite Sanitaire des Aliments, AFSSA) through two types of networks. The first collects non-human zoonotic Salmonella strains in one centre (AFSSA, Paris) where they are tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility. The others, managed by AFSSA Lyon, deal with bovine pathogenic strains and are multicentric, that is they collecting antibiotic sensitivity and other data from the local public veterinary diagnostic laboratories. This requires standardisation of the methods used in each partner laboratory. Statistical analysis of any change in French resistance patterns can be monitored by these three networks either as a function of strain pathogenicity and/or of the ecological origin of the isolate. The system also encourages efficient collaboration between veterinarians and the laboratory. Such collaboration improves both the quality of routine antibiotic testing and understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance.
