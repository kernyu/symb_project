OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism for adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) resistance occurred in chronic hepatitis B patients of a series of phase III clinical trails. METHODS: 30 resistant HBV strains were selected out from 177 cases of ADV treated chronic hepatitis B patients. HBV polymerase RT region were amplified by nested PCR and analyzed with the standard nucleotide sequence of HBV strains deposited in GeneBank. RESULTS: 21 out of 30 HBV strains were primary resistant strains, among them 5 HBV strains (23.8%, 5/21) had the polymorphism site of rtN118H. While the other 9 HBV strains showed secondary resistance, variations in conservative region C (rtM207V) and other non-conservative regions were found. The classic mutation sites such as rtN236T and rtA181V/T were not found. CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphism site of rtN118H might be responsible for HBV primary resistance to ADV therapy. rtM207V variation in HBV RT C domain and other variation sites might play a role in HBV secondary resistance to ADV treatment, and natural resistant quasispecies may be the basis for the ADV quick resistance. These conclusions await further confirmation by phenotype test.
