The Quattro Trial compared the use of four HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (zidovudine, lamivudine, loviride and zalcitabine), given either as four-drug combination therapy or monotherapy, with 8-week cycles of each drug, with zidovudine/lamivudine dual therapy. Observations of resistance associated and other mutations in the RT gene were made to determine whether therapy failure could be explained by acquisition of these mutations and whether novel mutation patterns developed. As in the intent-to-treat analysis, the use of cyclical monotherapy gave a smaller reduction in plasma virus load at 64 weeks (0.4 log10 copies/ml below baseline) than the quadruple or dual therapy arms (1.3 and 0.8 log10 copies/ml below baseline). Cyclical therapy appeared to generate less genotypic resistance to zidovudine, loviride or zalcitabine than the other arms. Resistance to lamivudine (mutation M184V) developed rapidly in all three arms. Resistance to zidovudine was acquired by a larger proportion of subjects on dual therapy than on quadruple therapy. Resistance to loviride or zalcitabine was rarely observed. During lamivudine monotherapy the M184V mutation was rapidly acquired and viral load rebounded. Zalcitabine monotherapy initially selected M184V mutants, but these were lost as therapy continued. Novel mutations that may have been associated with combination or cyclical quadruple therapy were observed infrequently. There was no clear correlation between changes in response to therapy and the development of previously described resistance mutations or with novel mutations in the RT gene.
