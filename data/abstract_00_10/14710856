The incidence of nosocomial infections in ICU is 4-5 times greater than in general ward. Critically ill patients are always at higher risk of developing nosocomial infections with resistant strains. This study is an attempt to know the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the common isolates in ICU. Samples comprising urine, blood, endotracheal secretions and throat swabs were collected from 102 ICU patients of them, 56 patients showed evidence of nosocomial infection (54.9%), from whom 120 different organisms were isolated. Antibiotic sensitivity test was done according to Kirby Bauer method. Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most prevalent isolates from respiratory tract infections followed by Proteus spp, Escherichia coli, Staphylococci spp. and Acinetobacter spp. The gram negative enteric bacilli were uniformly resistant to betalactam antibiotics as well as betalactam-betalactamase inhibitors. Resistance to Ciprofloxacin and Ceftriaxone ranged from 50-100% and 25-83.3% respectively. Staphylococci were 100% resistant to penicillin and tetracycline, 80% to cotrimoxazole, 60% to erythromycin and gentamicin and 40% to amikacin. Acinetobacter spp. were highly resistant to most of the antibacterial agents except gentamicin while Pseudomonas spp. showed 75% resistance to it. The increased prevalence of resistant organisms in ICU probably reflects lack of proper antibiotic policy resulting in prolonged and indiscriminate use of antimicrobial agent.
