The growth of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis IPLA 4549 and its derivative with acquired resistance to bile, B. animalis subsp. lactis 4549dOx, was evaluated in batch cultures with glucose or the glucose disaccharide maltose as the main carbon source. The acquisition of bile salt resistance caused a change in growth pattern for both sugars, which mainly resulted in a preferential use of maltose compared to glucose, whereas the mother strain used both carbohydrates in a similar way. High-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses were performed to determine the amounts of glucose consumption and organic acid and ethanol formation from glucose by buffered resting cells taken at different points during growth. Resting cells of the bile-adapted strain generally consumed less glucose than those of the nonadapted one but showed an enhanced production of ethanol and higher acetic acid-to-lactic acid as well as formic acid-to-lactic acid ratios. These findings suggest a shift in the catabolism of carbohydrates promoted by the acquisition of bile resistance that may cause changes in the redox potential and improvements in the cellular ATP yield.
