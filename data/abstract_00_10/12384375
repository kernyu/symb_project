A gene which mediates inducible resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B antibiotics, designated erm(33), was detected on the Staphylococcus sciuri plasmid pSCFS1. Analysis of the erm(33) reading frame suggested that this gene was the product of a recombination between an erm(C) gene and an erm(A) gene. Such a recombination event is a novel observation for erm genes.
