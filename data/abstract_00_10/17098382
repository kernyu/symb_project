Poultry feed is at the start of the food safety chain in the "farm-to-fork" model, and might serve as a source of antimicrobial resistant bacteria present in poultry meat. Antimicrobial resistance was investigated in 1137 enterococci and 163 Escherichia coli strains recovered from 23 samples of commercial broiler feed and 66 samples of raw feeding materials taken over half a year timespan. Enumeration of enterococci and E. coli were also performed using traditional plating and fluorescent in situ hybridisation methods. Viable enterococci were detected in all feed samples and in 66% of samples of separate feed ingredients, while E. coli was present in 50% and 32% of feed and raw feeding materials, respectively. The median values (50th percentile) for plate and FISH counts for feeds were, respectively, 2.70 log CFU/g and 5.52 log cells/g for enterococci, and 0.15 log CFU/g and 6.00 log cells/g for E. coli. Among enterococci recovered from feed ingredients, resistance to rifampicin, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin was found in 59.8%, 21.6%, 21.2%, 18.0% and 6.9% of the isolates, respectively. A considerable proportion of the enterococci isolates obtained from broiler feed displayed resistance to tetracycline (69.1%), rifampicin (58.5%), erythromycin (52.9%) and nitrofurantoin (36.2%). Lower percentage of resistance was observed to chloramphenicol (4.6%), ciprofloxacin (3.9%), vancomycin (1.9%) and ampicillin (1.2%). Among E. coli recovered from feed ingredients and poultry feeds, resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and streptomycin was found in 22.9%, 27.6% and 19.0% and in 22.4%, 41.4% and 17.0% of the isolates, respectively. These data show that feedstuffs and poultry feeds are extensively contaminated by resistant enterococci and, in a lesser extent, by E. coli, thus leading to their introduction in the farm environment.
