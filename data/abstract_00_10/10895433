Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis worldwide. The viral genome, a positive-sense, single-stranded, 9.6-kb long RNA molecule, is translated into a single polyprotein of about 3,000 amino acids. The viral polyprotein is proteoytically processed to yield all the mature viral gene products. The genomic order of HCV has been determined to be C-->E1-->E2-->p7-->NS2-->NS3-->NS4A-->NS4B-->NS5A++ +-->NS5B. C, E1, and E2 are the virion structural proteins. Whereas the function of p7 is currently unknown, NS2 to NS5B are thought to be the nonstructural proteins. Generation of the mature nonstructural proteins relies on the activity of viral proteinases. Cleavage at the NS2-NS3 junction is accomplished by a metal-dependent autocatalytic proteinase encoded within NS2 and the N-terminus of NS3. The remaining downstream cleavages are effected by a serine proteinase contained also within the N-terminal region of NS3. NS3, in addition, contains an RNA helicase domain at its C-terminus. NS3 forms a heterodimeric complex with NS4A. The latter is a membrane protein that acts as a cofactor of the proteinase. Although no function has yet been attributed to NS4B, NS5A has been recently suggested to be involved in mediating the resistance of the HCV to the action of interferon. Finally, the NS5B protein has been shown to be the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This article reviews the current understanding of the structure and the function of the various HCV nonstructural proteins with particular emphasis on their potential as targets for the development of novel antiviral agents and vaccines.
