Pneumococcal disease causes approximately 1 million deaths a year worldwide in children aged younger than 5 years. Increasing antibiotic-resistant strains have made management of pneumococcal disease difficult. A pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PNCRM7) has been shown to prevent invasive disease in young children; it has also demonstrated a modest impact on the prevention of otitis media. This conjugated vaccine provides a consistent immune response in infants and young children and can be administered simultaneously with other childhood vaccines. It is generally well tolerated, with local reactions similar to those observed with other licensed childhood vaccines. The objective of this review is to discuss the clinical efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of PNCRM7.
