The intracellular penetration and activity of UB-8902 in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was evaluated. Intracellular UB-8902 concentrations were 6-fold higher than extracellular levels. Uptake was rapid, reversible, saturable, and affected by external pH. UB-8902 showed intracellular activity against Staphylococcus aureus strains presenting mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in the gyrA and/or grlA genes.
