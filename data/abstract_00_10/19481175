The susceptibility of Giardia duodenalis trophozoites exposed in vitro to sublethal concentrations of metronidazole (MTZ) and albendazole (ABZ) may exhibit inter-culture (variability) and intra-culture (variation) differences in drug susceptibility. It was previously reported that MTZ-resistant trophozoites may display changes in pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) expression while changes at the beta-tubulin molecule are apparently absent in ABZ-resistant cultures. To assess the levels of gene expression of these molecules, we obtained cloned cultures growing at concentrations up to 23 microM MTZ (WBRM23) and up to 8muM ABZ (WBRA8) and gene sequence and expression of pfor and beta-tubulin loci were compared with these of drug-susceptible clone WB1. Neither the pfor nor the beta-tubulin genes showed changes at sequence level but the MTZ-resistant clones WBRM21 and WBRM23 showed up-regulation of the pfor RNA using the gdh gene as reference. By using WB1 and WBRA8 clones in representational difference analyses of gene expression (RDA) an insert referred to as ARR-VSP was selected and sequenced. It showed the highest homology to one VSP molecule in the Giardia Genome Database (orf GL50803_101765). This isogene was up-regulated in five ABZ-resistant clones and the clone WBRA8 exhibited the highest RNA expression level. When successive progenies of clones WB1, WBRM23 and WBRA8 were analyzed in Northern blot assays to detect pfor and ARR-VSP RNAs respectively, the expression patterns showed variation for both genes but it was much lower in the clone WBRA8. These results suggest that G. duodenalis cultures either susceptible or resistant to MTZ and ABZ may display variability and variation at RNA expression levels albeit these were more marked in the MTZ-resistant parasites. These data might have further implications defining major mechanisms involved in drug resistance of Giardia.
