Eleven randomized, controlled trials of antibiotic treatment versus placebo in patients with Campylobacter species infection were pooled in a meta-analysis. Antibiotic treatment shortened the duration of intestinal symptoms by 1.32 days (95% confidence interval, 0.64-1.99; P<.0001). Because of problems with drug resistance, a restrictive attitude towards the administration of antibiotics in uncomplicated cases is advised.
