OBJECTIVE: Increasing antimicrobial resistance in bacteria is a major health problem and requires the implementation of stringent policies to optimize the use of antibiotics. DESIGN: In 2003 the authors conducted a study in southwestern French hospitals, using a questionnaire to assess the implementation of antibiotic policies according to national guidelines issued by the French government in 2002. RESULTS: The most frequent actions quoted by the 99 respondents were: issuing of a list of available antibiotics, issuing of information regarding antibiotic consumption and bacterial resistance, and control of antibiotics dispensation. Local guidelines were available in 45% of hospitals for curative treatment and in 87% for antibioprophylaxis in surgery. The evaluation of antibiotic use and computer links between clinical settings, pharmacy and microbiology lab were the less widespread measures. The number and type of actions were related to hospital size and activity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that policies for an appropriate use of antimicrobials should be reinforced by issuing treatment guidelines and specific tools for dispensation and evaluation. This survey also emphasizes the need for appropriate policies relating to the size and medical activities of healthcare institutions.
