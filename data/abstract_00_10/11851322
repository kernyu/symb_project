Synthetic recombinant vaccines are constructs in which a synthetic oligonucleotide coding for a protective epitope is inserted into an adequate gene for expression of the epitope. We report the results obtained using recombinant flagella of Salmonella vaccine strain expressing epitopes of influenza virus or of the parasite Schistosoma mansoni. In the case of influenza virus, three conserved epitopes of the haemagglutinin and the nucleoprotein of the virus inducing B- and T-cell immune response, were expressed and the flagella were used for intranasal immunization without any adjuvant. Both humoral and cellular immune responses specific to the virus induced in mice cross-strain long-term protection against challenge infection. Aged mice were also able to resist infection. For the design of a human influenza vaccine, epitopes recognized by the HLAs prevalent in Caucasian populations were used, and the resulting vaccine was evaluated in human/mouse radiation chimaera in which human PBMC are functionally engrafted. The vaccinated mice demonstrated efficient clearance of the virus after challenge and resistance to lethal infection. In the case of the parasitic disease schistosomiasis, a 14-residue peptide denoted 9B peptide 1 was expressed in the flagella. Intranasal vaccination of mice with this construct, without the use of adjuvant, resulted in 40% protection against challenge infection.
