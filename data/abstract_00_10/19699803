The present experiment was carried out to study the effect of different dosages of beta-glucan suspension derived from barley on the innate immune response and disease resistance of Anabas testudineus spawns against infection caused by Aeromonas hydrophila. Four different dosages of beta-glucan suspension in phosphate buffered saline at the rate of 0, 5, 10, 15 mg l(-1) were taken and 8 days old spawn were exposed for 2 h and 3 h. The cell suspension of spawn was assayed for total protein, acid phosphatase activity, lysozyme activity, bactericidal and NBT. Further, the spawns were challenged with 3 x 10(5) cells ml(-1) of A. hydrophila and survivability percentage and immunological parameters were assayed upto day 7. On day 7, most of the immunological parameters such as lysozyme activity, bactericidal activity and NBT activity were significantly enhanced after exposing the fish to all the concentrations of beta-glucan. Challenge study indicated least mortality in the group of spawns immersed in 15 mg l(-1) beta-glucan suspension for 3 h. Thus, 3 h exposure to beta-glucan suspension could reduce the mortality and increase the immunity of A. testudineus spawns.
