Efficacy of panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) against experimental pneumonia caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP: MIC of benzylpenicillin, > or = 1.56 micrograms/ml) in mice was compared with those of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS), meropenem (MEPM), cefozopran (CZOP), ceftriaxone (CTRX), ampicillin (ABPC), and vancomycin (VCM). The infection was induced by inoculating a PRSP clinical isolate, 9601 (serotype 6) or 10,693 (serotype 19), into ddY male mice intranasally. Drugs were administered subcutaneously at doses of 0.4, 2, and 10 mg/kg, 18, 26, 42, and 50 hours post-infection. Viable cell counts in the lungs were determined 66 hours post-infection. PAPM/BP showed the greatest efficacy against the infections among tested drugs. MICs of PAPM against PRSP 9601 and 10,693 were both 0.125 microgram/ml, which were superior to those of IPM (0.25 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively), MEPM (0.5 and 1 microgram/ml, respectively), CZOP (2 and 1 microgram/ml, respectively), CTRX (both 1 microgram/ml), ABPC (both 4 micrograms/ml), and VCM (0.5 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively). These results suggest that the potent in vivo activity of PAPM/BP reflects the potent in vitro activity of PAPM. MICs of PAPM, IPM, MEPM, and CZOP against clinical isolates, penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP: MIC of benzylpenicillin, < or = 0.05 microgram/ml), penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP: MIC of benzylpenicillin, 0.1-0.78 microgram/ml), and PRSP, were tested by an agar dilution method. MIC90s of the drugs against the PSSP, PISP, and PRSP were as follows: PAPM, 0.012, 0.05, and 0.39 microgram/ml; IPM, < or = 0.006, 0.1, and 0.78 microgram/ml; MEPM, 0.05, 0.39, and 1.56 micrograms/ml; and CZOP, 0.2, 0.78, and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Thus, PAPM showed the most potent activity among tested drugs against clinical isolates of PISP and PRSP.
