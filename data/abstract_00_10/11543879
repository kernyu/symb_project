To date the majority of sequencing technologies have been based on use of gel plates. In this study sequencing by capillary electrophoresis for HIV-1 genotyping on the CEQ 2000 sequencer (Beckman Coulter Inc.) has been investigated and compared to an 'in house' protocol on the Prism-377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and to the HIV-1 TruGene kit (Visible Genetics Inc.), two gel plate-based systems. Plasma from 20 HAART-treated patients with virological failure were analyzed for protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes. A total of 520 RT codons (26/patient) and 360 PR codons (18/patient) related to antiretroviral drug resistance were evaluated. The overall agreement between CEQ 2000 and Prism-377 results was 100% for the RT and PR primary and secondary mutations. The overall agreement between CEQ 2000 and TruGene was 100% for primary and > or =97% for secondary mutations. Discrepant results would have never led to errors in genotype interpretation. Performances for a 24 patients/week/one technician genotyping throughput were analyzed. For Prism-377, TruGene and CEQ 2000, manual processing required 5, 4 and 2,5 days, sequence data analysis needed additional 3, 1 and 2 days and cost/patient was approximately 49, 214 and 39 $, respectively. The CEQ 2000 sequencer offers a reliable alternative for fast and cost effective HIV drug resistance analysis.
