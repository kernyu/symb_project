A novel real-time PCR-hybridization assay was developed for the rapid (<1 h) detection of penicillin susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae. When applied to 24 pneumococcal DNA-positive cerebrospinal fluid extracts, penicillin-sensitive S. pneumoniae was detected in all instances. Real-time PCR proved more sensitive than culture, microscopy, or antigen detection and provided susceptibility data even in culture-negative cases.
