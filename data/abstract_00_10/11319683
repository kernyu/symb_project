To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 regimens of intermittent subcutaneous (sc) interleukin (IL)--2 in a phase 2 study, 61 antiviral drug-experienced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)--positive patients were randomly assigned to one of the following study arms: antiretroviral therapy (ART) plus IL-2 (12 million IU [MIU] by continuous intravenous infusion, followed by 7.5 MIU twice a day, sc, every 8 weeks); ART plus IL-2 (7.5 MIU twice a day, sc, every 8 weeks); ART plus IL-2 (3 MIU twice a day, sc, every 4 weeks); or ART alone. A significant increase of circulating CD4 cells was observed in IL-2--treated subjects, compared with those given ART alone. Low doses of IL-2 were better tolerated. Despite the incomplete suppression of viral replication, IL-2 with ART did not increase either plasma viremia or cell-associated HIV DNA levels. Low doses of intermittent sc IL-2 induced a stable increase of peripheral CD4 cells that was indistinguishable from those associated with higher, less well-tolerated doses of IL-2.
