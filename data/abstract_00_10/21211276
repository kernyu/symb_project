OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicities of gemcitabine combined with ifosfamide and anthracycline chemotherapy for recurrent platinum resistant ovarian epithelial cancer. METHODS: Gemcitabine 800 mg/m(2) (day 1, 8), ifosfamide 1.5 g/m(2) (day 1 - 3), adriamycin 40 mg/m(2) or epirubicin 60 mg/m(2) (day 1) or mitoxantrone 10 mg/m(2) (day 1, 8) were used in recurrent platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer patients, the cycle was repeated at interval of 21 to 28 days. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients received 172 cycles combined chemotherapy. There were no one cases complete response, while partial response 22 (37%, 22/60), stable 23 (38%, 23/60) and progression 15 (25%, 15/60) were observed, with clinical benefit rate 75% (45/60). The median time of progression-free survival was 7 months, and the median overall survival time was 20 months. The main side effect was hematologic toxicity with leukopenia rate of 82% (49/60), among which III-IV accounted for 31% (15/49). Digestive reaction was all in I-II, accounted for 42% (25/60). CONCLUSION: The regimen of gemcitabine combined with ifosfamide and anthracycline is feasible, tolerable and effective in patients with recurrent platinum resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.
