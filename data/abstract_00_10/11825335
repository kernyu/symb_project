Nevirapine (Viramune, Boehringer Ingelheim) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NNRTI) effective in the treatment of HIV-1 infected antiretroviral-naive and -experienced patients. Some recent studies have suggested that nevirapine-based regimens may have an efficacy similar to protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens, at least in naive patients with CD4+ > 200 microl, while it lacks the drawbacks inherent in PI-containing regimens, such as lipodystrophy and metabolic alterations. Switching from a PI-containing regimen to a nevirapine-containing regimen seems to retain the virological response to therapy and it may also limit or reverse the development of some metabolic disorders induced by PIs. Nevirapine is also effective in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 disease and in the treatment of HIV-1 infected children. Nevirapine is well-tolerated, rash being the most common severe adverse effect observed. Hepatotoxicity may also appear with nevirapine, mainly in patients with chronic hepatitis C and/or altered liver function tests. This side effect may occasionally be life-threatening but it can be safely managed in most patients.
