Methanol extract and its fractions (CHCl3, n-BuOH and H2O) of the fruit body of Phellinus linteus mushroom were investigated for antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The n-BuOH fraction showed a good antibacterial activity (MIC, 63-125 microg/ml) against all tested strains.
