We investigated the mode of action of ES-1273, a novel DNA gyrase inhibitor obtained by optimization of ES-0615, which was found by screening our chemical library using anucleate cell blue assay. ES-1273 exhibited the same antibacterial activity against S. aureus strains with amino acid change(s) conferring quinolone- and coumarin-resistance as that against a susceptible strain. In addition, ES-1273 inhibited DNA gyrase supercoiling activity, but not ATPase activity of the GyrB subunit of DNA gyrase. Moreover, ES-1273 did not induce cleavable complex. These findings demonstrate that the mechanism by which ES-1273 inhibits DNA gyrase is different from that of the quinolones or the coumarins. Preincubation of DNA gyrase and substrate DNA prevented inhibition of DNA gyrase supercoiling activity by ES-1273. ES-1273 antagonized quinolone-induced cleavage. In electrophoretic mobility shift assay, no band representing DNA gyrase-DNA complex was observed in the presence of ES-1273. Taken together, these results indicate that ES-1273 prevents DNA from binding to DNA gyrase. Furthermore, our results from surface plasmon resonance experiments strongly suggest that ES-1273 interacts with DNA. Therefore, the interaction between ES-1273 and DNA prevents DNA from binding to DNA gyrase, resulting in inhibition of DNA gyrase supercoiling. Interestingly, we also found that ES-1273 inhibits topoisomerase IV and human topoisomerase IIalpha, but not human topoisomerase I. These findings indicate that ES-1273 is a type II topoisomerase specific inhibitor.
