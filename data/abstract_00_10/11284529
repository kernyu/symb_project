Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have recently emerged as an increasing concern in the management of severe infections. Treatment of these life-threatening infections has been limited to quinupristin-dalfopristin and, more recently, linezolid therapy. We report the first case, to our knowledge, of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium vertebral osteomyelitis treated successfully with quinupristin-dalfopristin. We review the recent epidemiology of VRE and briefly outline the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of quinupristin-dalfopristin.
