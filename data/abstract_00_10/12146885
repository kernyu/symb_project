Information about the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in commensal enteric bacteria is of interest because these bacteria are potential indicators of selection pressure on enteric bacteria and represent a reservoir of resistance genes in potentially pathogenic bacteria. This study reports changes in the prevalence of resistance to antibiotics in commensal Escherichia coli from cattle receiving either subcutaneously injectable oxytetracycline in addition to in-feed chlortetracycline or only in-feed chlortetracycline. Resistance to 19 antibiotics was examined. The use of injectable oxytetracycline in addition to in-feed chlortetracycline was significantly associated (P < 0.05) with an increase in the prevalence of resistance only to chloramphenicol and sulfisoxazole.
