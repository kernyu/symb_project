A 40-year-old man was admitted with a diagnosis of MRSA aortic valve endocarditis. He was treated conservatively with clindamycin and vancomycin for three days, but embolism occurred into the brain and the right lower limb, and urgent aortic valve replacement was performed. Resecting an aortic annular abscess resulted in a huge defect of the root. The defect was reconstructed with a combined patch: a Dacron graft lined with pericardium using vancomycin-containing fibrin glue. Although complete healing of the infected leg wound was slow, no prosthetic valve endocarditis has been detected in the 11 months since operation.
