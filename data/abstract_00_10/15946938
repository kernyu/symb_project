Overexpression of the BcrC(Bs) protein, formerly called YwoA, in Escherichia coli or in Bacillus subtilis allows these bacteria to stand higher concentrations of bacitracin. It was suggested that BcrC(Bs) was a membrane-spanning domain of an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter involved in bacitracin resistance. However, we hypothesized that this protein has an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (UPP) phosphatase activity able to compete with bacitracin for UPP. We found that overexpression of a recombinant His6-BcrC(Bs) protein in E. coli (i) increased the resistance of the cells to bacitracin and (ii) increased UPP phosphatase activity in membrane preparations by 600-fold. We solubilized and prepared an electrophoretically pure protein exhibiting a strong UPP phosphatase activity. BcrC(Bs), which belongs to the type 2 phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP2) phosphatase superfamily (PF01569), differs totally from the already known BacA UPP phosphatase from E. coli, a member of the PF02673 family of the Protein family (Pfam) database. Thus, BcrC(Bs) and its orthologs form a new class of proteins within the PAP2 phosphatase superfamily, and likely all of them share a UPP phosphatase activity.
