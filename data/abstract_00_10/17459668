The treatment of bone and joint infections, mainly caused by Gram-positive pathogens, can be difficult and quite challenging since it frequently involves prolonged administration of antibiotics as well as appropriate surgical procedures. First-line drugs have failed in some cases to cure the underlying infection. We performed a systematic review of the available evidence to clarify further the effectiveness and safety of daptomycin in the treatment of bone and joint infections. Cure of infection was achieved in 43/53 cases (81.1%). The results of the reviewed articles are promising with regard to the effectiveness and safety profile of this new antibiotic for bone and joint infections that are not responsive to other traditionally used antimicrobial agents. Although these reports are encouraging, the relatively frequent emergence of antimicrobial resistance associated with prolonged administration of daptomycin should be considered seriously.
