In Germany, around 800.000 to 1 million individuals are chronically infected with either the hepatitis B or the hepatitis C virus. Viral hepatitis is therefore highly relevant for the everyday management in clinical practice. For the treatment of hepatitis B, potent antiviral drugs have become available that, in the majority of patients, induce viral suppression. This requires a strategic therapeutic planning in view of a likelihood of long term administration and the prevention of viral resistance. Recent advances in the treatment of hepatitis C are based on a therapeutic individualization based upon viral kinetics and genotypes that also requires strategic planning. In contrast to hepatitis B, viral elimination can be reached in 50-90% of hepatitis C patients. Hepatitis D is associated with a migration background, is most likely under diagnosed and does not yet have a satisfactory curative treatment option. An effective vaccine exists for hepatitis A that offers protection lasting decades. Hepatitis A does not lead to chronic infection. This was also assumed for hepatitis E. However, reports indicate chronic courses in selected patient groups. A vaccine for hepatitis E is currently not yet available.
