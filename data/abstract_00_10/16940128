We selected in vitro erythromycin-resistant strains of Bartonella henselae. The mutants obtained had point mutations in domain V of 23S rRNA and/or in ribosomal protein L4. One lymph node of a patient with cat-scratch disease had such a mutation in 23S rRNA, suggesting that natural resistant strains may infect humans.
