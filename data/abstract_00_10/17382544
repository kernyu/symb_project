We have previously reported a novel class of tetrahydroindazoles that display potency against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, potentially via interaction with type II bacterial topoisomerases. Herein are reported SAR investigations of this new series. Several compounds possessing broad-spectrum potency were prepared. Further, these compounds exhibit activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive microorganisms equivalent to that against susceptible strains.
