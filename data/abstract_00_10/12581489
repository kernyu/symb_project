A previous study showed that virus-resistant F344 rats had higher levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) than did virus-susceptible BN rats early after Sendai viral infection. The initial goal of this study was to determine if an early high expression of IP-10 in F344 rats contributes to their resistance to virus-induced airway injury. Infected F344 rats were treated with anti-IP-10 rabbit serum or normal rabbit serum. Results indicated that blocking of IP-10 protein did not significantly change the resistance of F344 rats. However, we observed that neutralization of IP-10 increased IFN-gamma protein in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of F344 rats 7 days after inoculation compared with rats that received normal rabbit serum. The pulmonary IFN-gamma mRNA abundance remained comparable. This effect was not caused by fluctuation of the viral titer in the lung. This interesting phenomenon suggests that expression of IFN-gamma protein can be modulated by treatment with anti-IP-10 antibody at the posttranscriptional or translational level in this model.
