Cryptococcus neoformans has emerged as an important opportunistic fungal pathogen in immunocompromised individuals. The therapeutic options of C. neoformans an opportunistic fungal pathogen include flucytosine, amphotericin B, and azole agents. However in the present scenario, emergence of resistance has been reported, hence this study was undertaken to evaluate antifungal susceptibility pattern of C. neoformans isolates from this southern part of India. Ten isolates of C. neoformans were tested against Amp B and fluconazole, of which 7 were susceptible to both and a single isolate of C. neoformans var gatti was resistant to both with MIC of 32mg/ml and 64mg/ml respectively.
