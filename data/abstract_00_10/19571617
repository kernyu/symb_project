BACKGROUND: Since metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing isolates can hydrolyze carbapenem and also easily transfer the resistance genes to other bacteria, a rapid and accurate detection of MBL has become very important. We evaluated the utility of Mueller Hinton agar (MHA) biplate containing dipicolinic acid (DPA) as a screening method to detect IMP-1 and VIM-2 type MBL-producing isolates. METHODS: Based on our preliminary tests using various concentrations of DPA, 200 and 300 microg/mL concentration of DPA were chosen for further study. Bacterial lawns were grown on MHA biplate, one half of which contained DPA while the other did not. The inhibition zone around the imipenem (IPM) disk on both sides of this plate was compared. The stability of DPA in the stored DPA-MHA biplate was also evaluated during three months using two MBL- and one non-MBL-producing isolates. RESULTS: When the criterion of a > or =7 mm increase of inhibition zone around the IPM disk on the MHA containing DPA compared to MHA without DPA was used, the sensitivities and specificities were 94.7% and 97.6% for 200 microg/mL DPA-MHA biplate, and 98.2% and 97.6% for 300 microg/mL DPA-MHA biplate, respectively. The activity of the DPA in this biplate was stable for three months. CONCLUSIONS: Assays using DPA 300-MHA biplate were highly sensitive and specific for the detection of IMP-1 and VIM-2 type MBL-producing bacteria. In addition, it is easy to perform; so, it may be useful to apply this method for detection of IMP-1 and VIM-2 type MBL in clinical laboratories.
