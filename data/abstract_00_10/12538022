Dodecyl (C(12)) gallate (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate) (1) was found to possess antibacterial activity specifically against Gram-positive bacteria, in addition to its potent antioxidant activity. The time-kill curve study indicates that this amphipathic gallate exhibits bactericidal activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. Dodecyl (lauryl) gallate inhibited oxygen consumption in whole cells and oxidation of NADH in membrane preparation. The antibacterial activity of this gallate comes in part from its ability to inhibit the membrane respiratory chain. As far as alkyl gallates are concerned, their antimicrobial spectra and potency depend in part on the hydrophobic portion of the molecule.
