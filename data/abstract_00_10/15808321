Tigecycline is the first glycylcycline antimicrobial in phase III clinical trials. This study compares the in vitro activity of tigecycline to 12 other predominately broad-spectrum antimicrobials against 3049 recent inpatient isolates from 38 clinical centers in 17 countries. The minimum concentration at which tigecycline inhibited 90% of the isolates for the entire collection, excluding Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was 1 microg/mL, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci-, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-resistant phenotypes.
