The progressive emergence of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-positive cocci especially in the setting of surgery and intensive care, recommends particular attention in making sound therapeutic choices to overcome both microbial resistances and haemato-encephalic barriers to effective local drug penetration. As in other Western countries, the occurrence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is particularly high also in Italy, especially when high-risk patients and/or settings are involved. In treating post-neurosurgical central nervous system infections (cerebral abscess and meningitis), a key issue is represented by the low cerebrospinal fluid concentration of the two available glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and teicoplanin), usually recommended as first-line therapy of resistant Gram-positive cocci. Recent findings have focused on the possible role of linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibiotic, as a suitable candidate for the treatment of severe brain infection (abscesses) and post-neurosurgical infection, where treatment options and efficacy are significantly limited by the low glycopeptide transfer and the spread of glycopeptide-resistant bacterial strains. Three representative case reports (two brain abscesses and one post-surgical meningitis) are presented and discussed in light of the current literature: in all these cases, salvage linezolid treatment proved resolutory.
