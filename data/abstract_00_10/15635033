A multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate was taken from the blood of a 75-year-old patient with nosocomial pneumonia who developed septic shock and failed therapy with imipenem. The isolate presented an MIC of imipenem of 128 microg/ml, and the production of a metallo-beta-lactamase was confirmed by phenotypic and genotypic techniques. We here report, for the first time, the detection of a metalloenzyme (IMP-1)-producing K. pneumoniae clinical strain in Latin America. The gene responsible for this phenotype was found to be bla(IMP-1), carried in a class 1 integron.
