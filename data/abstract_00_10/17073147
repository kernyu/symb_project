Proteins specifically reacting with AP1, MEF1, NF-IL6, and SP1 transcription factor binding sites were detected for the first time in nuclear extract of P. berghei (rodent malaria parasite) using gel retardation assay. P. berghei strains with different chloroquine resistance exhibited appreciable differences in the pattern of nuclear protein binding to the majority of the studied sites, which attests to changes in the plasmodial regulatory system during chloroquine resistance selection.
