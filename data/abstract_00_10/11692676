The dynamics of change in the component composition of dendrodochines in the process of cultivation of Dendrodochium toxicum 100115 has been studied. It has been shown on the basis of the data of thin-layer chromatography that verrucarines A and J are found during the whole period of the fungus growth. Rhoridines A and E in the initial period of cultivation (1-2 days) are found in trace quantities only. Rhoridine A is found on the 1-3 and 8-10th days of the producer cultivation and its content is inconsiderable only on the 4-6th day. An analysis of qualitative content of the studied verrucarines and rhoridines evidence for its considerable changes in the dynamics of the fungus growth and supposes the reci procal transformation of certain components. The registered processes are accompanied by the change of biological activity of preparations with respect to the used test-objects. A possible mechanism of the producer resistance to its own toxical metabolites is discussed in the light of the data obtained.
