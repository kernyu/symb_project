Our recent study demonstrated that a novel proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 is distinct from bortezomib (Velcade) and, importantly, triggers apoptosis in multiple myeloma (MM) cells resistant to bortezomib. Here we demonstrate that combining NPI-0052 and lenalidomide (Revlimid) induces synergistic anti-MM activity in vitro using MM-cell lines or patient MM cells. NPI-0052 plus lenalidomide-induced apoptosis is associated with (1) activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-12, caspase-3, and poly(ADP) ribose polymerase; (2) activation of BH-3 protein BIM; (3) translocation of BIM to endoplasmic reticulum; (4) inhibition of migration of MM cells and angiogenesis; and (5) suppression of chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like proteasome activities. Importantly, blockade of BIM using siRNA significantly abrogates NPI-0052 plus lenalidomide-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, studies using biochemical inhibitors of caspase-8 versus caspase-9 demonstrate that NPI-0052 plus lenalidomide-triggered apoptosis is primarily dependent on caspase-8 signaling. In animal tumor model studies, low-dose combination of NPI-0052 and lenalidomide is well tolerated, significantly inhibits tumor growth, and prolongs survival. Taken together, our study provides the preclinical rationale for clinical protocols evaluating lenalidomide together with NPI-0052 to improve patient outcome in MM.
