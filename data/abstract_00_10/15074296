We present a patient with isolated steroid resistant autoimmune haemolytic anaemia successfully treated with cyclosporin A for 7 months with no adverse side effects and free of disease after 2 years of therapy. We thus recommend to consider cyclosporin A as a first choice in steroid resistant patients with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. More studies are necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of this treatment.
