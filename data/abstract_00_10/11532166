A novel Arabidopsis mutant has been identified with constitutive expression of GST1-GUS using plants with a pathogen-responsive reporter transgene containing the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) coding region driven by the GST1 promoter. The recessive mutant, called agd2 (aberrant growth and death2), has salicylic acid (SA)-dependent increased resistance to virulent and avirulent strains of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, elevated SA levels, a low level of spontaneous cell death, callose deposition, and enlarged cells in leaves. The enhanced resistance of agd2 to virulent P. syringae requires the SA signaling component NONEXPRESSOR OF PR1 (NPR1). However, agd2 renders the resistance response to P. syringae carrying avrRpt2 NPR1-independent. Thus agd2 affects both an SA- and NPR1-dependent general defense pathway and an SA-dependent, NPR1-independent pathway that is active during the recognition of avirulent P. syringae. agd2 plants also fail to show a hypersensitive cell death response (HR) unless NPR1 is removed. This novel function for NPR1 is also apparent in otherwise wild-type plants: npr1 mutants show a stronger HR, while NPR1-overproducing plants show a weaker HR when infected with P. syringae carrying the avrRpm1 gene. Spontaneous cell death in agd2 is partially suppressed by npr1, indicating that NPR1 can suppress or enhance cell death depending on the cellular context. agd2 plants depleted of SA show a dramatic exacerbation of the cell-growth phenotype and increased callose deposition, suggesting a role for SA in regulating growth and this cell-wall modification. AGD2 may function in cell death and/or growth control as well as the defense response, similarly to what has been described in animals for the functions of NFkappaB.
