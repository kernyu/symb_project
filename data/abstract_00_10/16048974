Plasmid-mediated resistance to quinolones is increasingly reported in studies of Enterobacteriaceae. Using a PCR-based strategy, a series of gram-negative species were screened for qnrA-like genes. Shewanella algae, an environmental species from marine and fresh water, was identified as its reservoir. This is a one of the very few examples of progenitor identification of an acquired antibiotic resistance gene.
