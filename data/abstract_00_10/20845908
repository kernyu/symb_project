Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global health problem requiring novel approaches for effective treatment of this disease. The HCV NS5B polymerase has been demonstrated to be a viable target for the development of HCV therapies. beta-d-2'-Deoxy-2'-alpha-fluoro-2'-beta-C-methyl nucleosides are selective inhibitors of the HCV NS5B polymerase and have demonstrated potent activity in the clinic. Phosphoramidate prodrugs of the 5'-phosphate derivative of the beta-d-2'-deoxy-2'-alpha-fluoro-2'-beta-C-methyluridine nucleoside were prepared and showed significant potency in the HCV subgenomic replicon assay (<1 muM) and produced high levels of triphosphate 6 in primary hepatocytes and in the livers of rats, dogs, and monkeys when administered in vivo. The single diastereomer 51 of diastereomeric mixture 14 was crystallized, and an X-ray structure was determined establishing the phosphoramidate stereochemistry as Sp, thus correlating for the first time the stereochemistry of a phosphoramidate prodrug with biological activity. 51 (PSI-7977) was selected as a clinical development candidate.
