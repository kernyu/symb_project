Psychological stress can modulate host defense against invading pathogens. In this study, we investigated the effect of dietary oils on social isolation stress-induced modulation of host resistance to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. In olive oil-fed mice, 3 weeks of isolation stress resulted in temporarily delayed clearance of this fungus in the liver compared with group-housed mice. By contrast, in soybean oil-fed mice, isolation stress had no significant effect on antifungal activity. The olive oil-fed mice showed greater liver interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-6 production in response to infection as compared with the soybean oil-fed mice. In the olive oil-fed mice, isolation stress led to greater infection-induced IFN-gamma production in the liver compared with the group-housed animals. These results indicate that the modulatory effects of psychological stress on host resistance to P. brasiliensis can vary depending on dietary fatty acid composition.
