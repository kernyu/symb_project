In this work, we report the spread of CTX-M-producing uropathogenic ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. This is the first identification in Italy of the simultaneous presence of aac(6')-Ib-cr, qnrB1, and bla(CTX-M-15) resistance determinants in an Escherichia coli strain isolated from urine of a nonhospitalized patient.
