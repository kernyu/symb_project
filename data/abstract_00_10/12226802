Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance to antimicrobials is an important therapeutic consideration. Antibiotic resistance to P. aeruginosa may be chromosomally or plasmid mediated. Resistance to P. aeruginosa may also be affected by changes in the cellular membrane or intracellular environment. P. aeruginosa is primarily a nosocomial organism that most commonly colonizes respiratory secretions and urine. The selection of an antipseudomonal antibiotic depends on its inherent in vitro activity and its resistance potential. Anti-P. aeruginosa antibiotics with a high-resistance potential include gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, and imipenem. Anti-P. aeruginosa antibiotics with a low-resistance potential include amikacin, piperacillin, cefoperazone, cefepime, meropenem, and polymyxin B.
