The aim of this study was to determine the susceptibility of Candida isolates obtained from patients with Candida-associated denture stomatitis to 4 antimycotics. Antifungal susceptibility was assayed using the ATB-Fungus-2INT test. A total of 120 Candida strains were identified: C albicans (59.2%), C glabrata (20%), C tropicalis (12.5%), and C parapsilosis (8.3%). Amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, fluconazole, and itraconazole were effective against 100%, 98.6%, 88.7%, and 87.3% of C albicans and 79.6%, 77.6%, 71.4%, and 79.6% of the other Candida strains, respectively. The identification of candidal strains and determination of their susceptibility to antifungals may improve the management of Candida-associated denture stomatitis.
