The excitement of drug-eluting stents and their promise for reduced restenosis rates have been tempered by recent reports of stent thrombosis. The mechanism of stent thrombosis is multifactorial but appears to be related to delayed endothelialization and healing, late stent malapposition, and antiplatelet resistance. The most important risk factor appears to be the discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy. The data from clinical trials suggest that drug-eluting stents are associated with increased incidence of death or myocardial infarction compared with bare metal stents at long-term follow-up, suggesting that the window of thrombotic risk with drug-eluting stents may extend far beyond that for bare metal stents. Measures to possibly decrease the incidence of stent thrombosis include improvements in antiplatelet regimens and newer generation of drug-eluting stents which have biodegradable polymers or are polymer-free. In addition, percutaneous coronary intervention with bare metal stents in patients may be helpful in those known to be intolerant or noncompliant to antiplatelet therapy, have planned procedures or surgeries, or have overwhelming risks which may require discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy.
