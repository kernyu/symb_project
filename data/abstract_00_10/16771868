We report on a 30-year-old man, with type 1 diabetes mellitus, who developed generalized allergy to insulin consisting of several bouts of tremor, tachycardia, breathlessness and syncope. Strong positive reactions to protamine and metacresol were demonstrated by skin-prick testing. Symptoms persisted despite the use of antihistamine therapy, Actrapid HM Paraben and Monotard (insulin without protamine and metacresol) and immunosuppression (tacrolimus). He underwent a cadaver pancreas transplantation with portal-enteric drainage in June 2003. Following the antithymocyte globulin induction, immunosuppression consisted in tacrolimus and sirolimus without steroids. The patient subsequently reported a complete resolution of his symptoms and excellent glycaemic control. Thirteen months after transplantation, the patient developed oral ulcerations and severe leucopoenia initially attributed to sirolimus, which was subsequently stopped. A hyperglycaemic episode following corticosteroid therapy for acute rejection therapy required the reintroduction of insulin. Allergic manifestations reappeared promptly. Currently, 2 years after transplantation, the patient is euglycaemic without insulin (glycated haemoglobin 5.8%) and he is free of allergic reactions.
