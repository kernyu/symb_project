OBJECTIVES: In the present review, background information on bacterial antibiotic resistance is presented to dental practitioners. The review provides practical advice for dental professionals to combat and halt bacterial resistance. DATA: Antibiotic use over time has led to the emergence of infectious bacteria that are resistant to several antibiotics. Bacterial resistance is now considered a major threat to public health, and control of resistance is an international priority. Here, we present the current basic knowledge on bacterial antibiotic resistance to dental professionals, and discuss their role in combating and halting resistance. SOURCES: The material presented in this review is primarily based on peer-reviewed literature searches in Medline using the phrase "antibiotic resistance" and the following key words: natural, acquired, mechanisms, use, dentists, and role. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic resistance is a global problem, and dentists must be involved in halting it. Prudent and judicious use of antibiotic by dentists is an essential method for combating bacterial resistance. Health authorities are encouraged to monitor trends in antibiotic prescriptions by dentists and measure antibiotic consumption in order to assess and limit antibiotic use.
