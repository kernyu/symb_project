OBJECTIVES: In the BfT-GermVet monitoring study, 417 Escherichia coli isolates collected during 2004-06 in Germany from various disease conditions of pigs (n = 87), horses (n = 102) or cats/dogs (n = 228) were investigated for their susceptibility to 24 antimicrobial agents. This study dealt with the identification of integron-associated resistance genes among these isolates. METHODS: Class 1 and class 2 integrons were detected by PCR. The variable parts of the integrons were cloned and sequenced. Transformation and conjugation experiments were conducted to confirm a plasmid location of the integrons. RESULTS: Class 1 and/or class 2 integrons, alone or in different combinations, were detected in 79 of the 417 E. coli isolates. Four trimethoprim resistance genes (dfrA1/12/14/17), five streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance genes (aadA1/2/4/5/6), two streptothricin resistance genes (estX, sat2), one gentamicin/tobramycin/kanamycin resistance gene (aadB) and one chloramphenicol resistance gene (catB3) were detected. Seven different cassette arrangements were identified within class 1 integrons: aadA1 (21 isolates), dfrA1 + aadA1 (18 isolates), dfrA17 + aadA5 (9 isolates), dfrA12 + orfF + aadA2 (8 isolates), aadB + aadA1 (1 isolate), dfrA14 + recombined aadA6 (1 isolate) and dfrA1 + catB3 + aadA4 (1 isolate). Three different cassette arrangements in class 2 integrons, dfrA1 + sat2 + aadA1 (24 isolates), estX + sat2 + aadA1 (6 isolates) and estX + sat2 + DeltaaadA1 (1 isolate), were identified. The plasmid location of class 1 and/or class 2 integrons was confirmed in 37 isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Class 1 and/or class 2 integrons carrying resistance gene cassettes were detected in 18.9% of the isolates tested. This molecular analysis complements the phenotypic susceptibility testing conducted in the BfT-GermVet monitoring study and helps to explain the persistence of resistance genes even without direct selective pressure.
