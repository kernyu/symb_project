OBJECTIVE: Evaluate efficacy and tolerability of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus stavudine and lamivudine long term in antiretroviral-naive patients. DESIGN: Open-label follow-up of prospective, randomized, multicenter trial. METHOD: Antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected subjects (N = 00) received of 3 doses of LPV/r plus stavudine and lamivudine for 48 weeks then received LPV/r soft-gel capsules 400/00 mg plus stavudine and lamivudine. After 6 years, subjects replaced stavudine with tenofovir. RESULTS: At 7 years, by intent-to-treat analysis, 61 % had plasma HIV-RNA <400 copies/mL and 59% had < 50 copies/mL. Thirty-nine subjects discontinued treatment due to adverse events (n = 6), personal/other reasons (0), loss to follow-up (9), and noncompliance (4). Among 28 subjects qualifying for drug resistance testing, no protease inhibitor or stavudine resistance was observed and 4 showed lamivudine resistance. Most common drug-related moderate or severe adverse events were diarrhea (28%), nausea (6%), and abdominal pain (11 %). Subjects who received stavudine (median 6.6 years) and switched to tenofovir demonstrated significant improvements in total cholesterol (p = .009), triglycerides (p = .023), apolipoprotein C-III (p < .001 ), adiponectin (p = .008), fasting insulin (p = .04), and leptin (p = .03). CONCLUSION: LPV/r-based therapy demonstrated sustained efficacy with no protease inhibitor or stavudine resistance through 7 years in antiretroviral-naive patients. Switching from stavudine to tenofovir resulted in significant improvements in multiple metabolic parameters.
