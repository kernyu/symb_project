A commercially available rapid fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) test, (seaFAST H. pylori Combi-Kit; SeaPro Theranostics International, Lelystad, The Netherlands) was used to simultaneously detect the presence of Helicobacter pylori and determine clarithromycin susceptibility in paraffin-embedded biopsy sections. The FISH method was found to be 97% sensitive, 94% specific for the detection of H. pylori and comparable to agar dilution for the detection of resistance to clarithromycin.
