A chicken B lymphoma line, DT40, hypermutates immunoglobulin (Ig) genes spontaneously during culture. Thus, cultured DT 40 cells constitute a useful Ig library for screening antibodies (Abs) in vitro. To fix desirable Ig mutants by stopping hypermutation or to resume mutation for further improvement of Ab affinity, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a key enzyme responsible for the Ig mutation machinery, must be switched on or off. To this end, we generated a DT40 line whose one AID allele was disrupted, and the other allele was replaced by the loxP-flanked AID construct. In this engineered cell line designated as DT40-SW, AID expression could be switched reversibly by tamoxifen-regulated Cre recombinase. Devices were also introduced to discriminate between the "AID-ON" and the "AID-OFF" cells by GFP expression and puromycin resistance, respectively. Starting from a single DT40-SW cell, Ig gene repertoire was efficiently diversified during culture only when AID expression was on.
