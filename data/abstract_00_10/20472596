OBJECTIVES: The aim of this prospective study was to examine the safety of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy in patients with rheumatic disease and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. METHODS: 14 patients with chronic HBV infection, 19 HBV-vaccinated patients and 19 patients with resolved HBV infection were included in the study. All HBV-infected patients received combination therapy with oral antivirals and anti-TNF agents. During treatment the levels of hepatitis B surface antibodies (anti-HBs) in HBV-vaccinated patients and of serum HBV DNA in patients with chronic or resolved HBV infection were monitored. RESULTS: No viral reactivation was observed in patients with resolved HBV infection while anti-HBs titres decreased during anti-TNF treatment in vaccinated patients, similarly to patients treated with methotrexate alone. None of the HBV-infected patients developed liver decompensation or a significant increase in alanine aminotransferase levels. One patient (7%) treated with lamivudine and etanercept showed viral reactivation due to the emergence of a lamivudine-resistant mutant strain. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF agents represent a safe option for patients with chronic HBV infection when combined with antiviral therapy, as well as in patients previously exposed to HBV receiving no HBV prophylaxis. Resistant HBV strains may arise in patients with chronic hepatitis B, necessitating the initial use of anti-HBV agents with a low risk of resistance.
