Despite concerted efforts to control sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) worldwide, they still remain a major public health problem. Out of the 25 organisms known to be transmitted sexually, travelers are at greater risk of acquiring HIV and other STDs in developing countries in view of the high prevalence rates in these countries, particularly after sexual exposure to local commercial sex workers (CSWs). Some of the STDs acquired during international travel are more likely to be resistant to standard antimicrobial regimens for the STDs. HIV, gonorrhoea, syphilis, non-specific urethritis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and other STDs are a significant risk for travelers who engage in unprotected sex, especially with overseas CSWs. It is recognized that barrier contraceptives provide considerable protection against STDs, but they are not regarded as 100% protective. Sexual abstinence and sexual monogamy with a 'known' partner carry a much lower risk than the safest of 'safer sex' practices. However, in the event of a sexual exposure to a new partner in the country being visited, prior hepatitis B immunization and the consistent and proper use of a latex condom are strongly advised, followed by proper medical investigations and physical examination on returning home, before sexual activity is resumed.
