This week, an almost complete DNA sequence of Plasmodium falciparum--one of the parasites that causes malaria--appears in Nature, and on page 129 of this issue of Science, other researchers report the DNA sequence of Anopheles gambiae, one of the mosquitoes that transmits P. falciparum to humans. Together with the human genome sequence, researchers now have in hand the genetic blueprints for the parasite, its vector, and its victim.
