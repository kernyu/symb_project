Several agricultural fungicides related to the antifungal strobilurins act as inhibitors of respiration by binding to mitochondrial cytochrome b. Two types of laboratory mutants resisting higher doses of the strobilurin-related inhibitor kresoxim-methyl were characterized for Venturia inaequalis, the causal agent of apple scab. Selection of mutagenized conidia by kresoxim-methyl yielded mutants altered in the expression of alternative respiration during the stage of conidia germination. Cytochrome b sequences were not affected in the respective mutants. Selection of conidia on media containing the alternative oxidase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid in addition to kresoxim-methyl yielded a highly resistant mutant distinguished by a G143A exchange in cytochrome b. The status of mitochondrial cytochrome b genes remained heteroplasmic, and mitochondria containing wild-type cytochrome b returned to high frequencies during cultivation on inhibitor-free medium. However, continuation of the selection process led to a more pronounced replacement of sensitive by mutated mitochondria. The G143A mutation of cytochrome b causing resistance of V. inaequalis to a strobilurin-related inhibitor has been reported previously for mouse mitochondria; and a permanent G143A exchange rendering naturally resistant mitochondria has been reported for the strobilurin-producing basidiomycete Mycena galopoda and for the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. At the corresponding position, alanine was also present in chloroplast cytochrome b6 exhibiting low binding of strobilurin-related inhibitors. The mutation of cytochrome b reported here for V. inaequalis describes the first example of a mutation in filamentous ascomycetes and is part of an assessment of resistance risks inherent to strobilurin fungicides.
