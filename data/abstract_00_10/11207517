BACKGROUND: The eradication of Helicobacter pylori plays a pivotal role in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Metronidazole resistance, common in Iran, is claimed to be a major reason for the failure of metronidazole-containing regimens. Both clarithromycin and furazolidone are potential alternatives for metronidazole. AIM: To assess and compare the effectiveness of clarithromycin- and furazolidone-based regimens in eradicating H. pylori in a population with a high metronidazole resistance rate. METHODS: Patients with proven duodenal ulcer and H. pylori infection were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The patients received 2 weeks of omeprazole 20 mg b.d., amoxicillin 1000 mg b.d, bismuth subcitrate 240 mg b.d. and either clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. (the OABC group) or furazolidone 200 mg b.d. (the OABF group). RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were randomized, 55 in the OABC group and 63 in the OABF group. The intention-to-treat eradication rate was 84% and 85% for the OABF and OABC groups, respectively. The per protocol eradication rates were 90% for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: OABC and OABF are both effective in eradicating H. pylori in areas where metronidazole resistance is a problem. OABF is a good alternative in the face of growing resistance to clarithromycin in developed countries, and is attractive for developing countries where clarithromycin is not readily available.
