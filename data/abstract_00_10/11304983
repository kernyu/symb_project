The development and use of antibiotics for the chemotherapy of bacterial infections was one of the most remarkable accomplishments in medicine of the 20th. However, antibiotic-resistant bacteria were found in clinical isolates soon after the introduction of the earliest antimicrobial agents into the market. Significant increases in prevalence of resistance to antimicrobial agents have been observed in common pathogens of humans in the worldwide and problems of resistance are still presently serious among the immunocompromised host. The most important of these organisms are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and certain gram-negative bacilli due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production. These antibiotic resistances have made antimicrobial therapy of many infections extremely difficult or virtually impossible in some instances. In this article, we reviewed the history of antibiotic-resistance and discussed on the future.
