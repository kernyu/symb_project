The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increased the need for rapid drug susceptibility tests, which are needed for adequate patient treatment. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) system to detect multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. The MGIT system was compared with two standard methods (proportion and resistance ratio methods). One hundred clinical M. tuberculosis isolates [25 susceptible to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF), 20 resistant to INH, 30 resistant to INH-RIF, and 25 resistant to INH-RIF and other drugs] obtained in the State of S o Paulo were tested for INH and RIF susceptibility. Full agreement among the tests was found for all sensitive and all INH-resistant strains. For RIF-resistant strains results among the tests agreed for 53 (96.4%) of 55 isolates. Results were obtained within 6 days (range, 5 to 8 days), 28 days and 12 days when using MGIT, the proportion method and the resistance ratio methods, respectively. The MGIT system presented an overall agreement of 96% when compared with two standard methods. These data show that the MGIT system is rapid, sensitive and efficient for the early detection of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis.
