The Bacillus subtilis BceAB ABC transporter involved in a defense mechanism against bacitracin is composed of a membrane-spanning domain and a nucleotide-binding domain. Induction of the structural bceAB genes requires the BceR response regulator and the BceS histidine kinase of a signal transduction system. However, despite the presence of such a transduction system and of bacitracin, no transcription from an unaltered bceA promoter is observed in cells lacking the BceAB transporter. Expression in trans of the BceAB transporter in these bceAB cells restores the transcription from the bceA promoter. Cells possessing a mutated nucleotide-binding domain of the transporter are also no longer able to trigger transcription from the bceA promoter in the presence of bacitracin, although the mutated ABC transporter is still bound to the membrane. In these cells, expression of the bceA promoter can no longer be detected, indicating that the ABC transporter not only must be present in the cell membrane, but also must be expressed in a native form for the induction of the bceAB genes. Several hypotheses are discussed to explain the simultaneous need for bacitracin, a native signal transduction system, and an active BceAB ABC transporter to trigger transcription from the bceA promoter.
