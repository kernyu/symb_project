Intermittent preventive treatment is the prescheduled administration of antimalarial drugs to at-risk patients in endemic areas. This approach, which is recommended for pregnant women, is being evaluated in children. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine recently proved to be more protective than artemisinin-containing regimens. Therefore, the use of artemisinin derivatives could potentially be restricted to symptomatic patients. Determinants of three pending issues: safety, efficacy throughout childhood, and effectiveness--the latter depending on the implementation of sustainable delivery mechanisms--are analyzed in this comment.
