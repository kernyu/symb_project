Chronic hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) may result in significant morbidity, including cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The management of chronic HBV cirrhosis is advancing rapidly. Current treatment options for patients with HBV-related cirrhosis include interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil. IFN-a is used less commonly today because of its toxicity, difficulty with administration, and the availability of safer drugs. Lamivudine, an oral nucleoside analog, has proven to be at least as effective, and is safer, than IFN-a in the treatment of HBV-related cirrhosis. It is plagued by the development of resistant viral mutants, however. The newest oral nucleotide analog, adefovir dipivoxil, has shown excellent efficacy in treatment-naive and lamivudine-resistant HBV patients and has lower rates of resistance in the short-term.
