The preparation of biocide-incorporated silicone coatings for antifouling/fouling release applications is described. The biocide Triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2, 4-dichlorophenoxy) phenol) was modified with alkenyl moieties and incorporated into a silicone backbone through covalent bonds. The presence of the biocide on the coating surface was expected to deter fouling organisms from attaching to the surface of the coating. Allyl glycidyl ether was used to provide crosslink functionalities. Resins were cured using vinyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane for hydrosilyl functionality and 1, 3-cyclohexane-bis (methylamine) for epoxy crosslinking functionality. Coatings were characterized by static water contact angle measurements and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. Synthetic control over the incorporation of crosslink functionalities within the polymer resin allowed tuning of the surface of the coating and of mechanical properties. Resistance to macrofouling was tested by static immersion tests in the Indian River Lagoon at the Florida Institute of Technology from 15 October 2003 to 13 November 2003. Preliminary results showed that the coatings prepared from biocide-incorporated silicones with the appropriate bulk modulus significantly reduced macrofouling.
