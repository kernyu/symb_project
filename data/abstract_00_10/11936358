Severe infections (SIs) in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) constitute difficult therapeutic problems confronting clinicians who deal with severely ill patients. Some SIs are opportunistic infections acquired either in the community or in hospitals, particularly in immunodepressed patients. The great majority of ICU infections are of nosocomial origin. Resistant organisms have led to changing antibiotic therapy in ICU infections. Before microbiology is available, empiric therapy is based on: (i) proper identification of bacterial risks in each infection site; (ii) local surveillance of frequent nosocomial organisms/susceptibility patterns in the ICU; (iii) identification of environmental risk factors and the patient's underlying condition. In documented infection, antibiotic therapy must take into account gram-positive vs gram-negative bacteria or mixed infections, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic parameters of chosen antibiotic(s) and concentrations at the infection site, in order to prevent selection of resistant mutants and to provide the most efficient antibiotic therapy. With increasingly sophisticated intensive care measures, invasive exploratory procedures, and surgical procedures, evolving profiles of hospital infections require updated Guidelines for treatment of severe infections in ICUs. Preventive and therapeutic strategies include control of antibiotic use, and suitable antibacterial treatments which result in shortened hospital stay, improved outcome of hospital infections and significant cost savings.
