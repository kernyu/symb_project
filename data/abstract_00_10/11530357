Genetic diversity in nematodes leads to variation in response to anthelmintics. Haemonchus contortus shows enormous genetic diversity, allowing anthelmintic resistance alleles to be rapidly selected. Anthelmintic resistance is now a widespread problem, especially in H. contortus. Here, I compare the genes involved in anthelmintic resistance in H. contortus with those that confer susceptibility or resistance on the free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. I also discuss the latest knowledge of genes associated with resistance to benzimidazoles, levamisole and the macrocyclic lactones and the need for DNA markers for anthelmintic resistance.
