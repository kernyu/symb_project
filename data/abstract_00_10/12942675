The immense burden of HIV disease in sub-Saharan Africa has focused international interest on HIV care, especially on the lack of access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Difficulties in implementing ART in Africa include drug costs, adequate long-term funding sources, assurance of drug quality, and rapid development of the human resources and healthcare infrastructure needed to deliver ART. Important questions requiring study are the minimum level of laboratory monitoring and clinical support consistent with good treatment outcomes, the impact of antiretroviral drug resistance on treated individuals and communities, and the effect of ART on transmission at a community level. There are some concerns and risks. First, a focus on treatment could compromise the commitment of individuals to risk-reduction, and of governments to prevention. Second, health equity could be reduced, by diverting scarce public funds from basic care for the poorest, to costly disease-suppressive care for a small and probably elite group. In conclusion, while prevention must be the first priority, care is also essential. The vast prevailing economic inequity between the world's rich and poor is the fundamental determinant of inequities in health and healthcare, including care for HIV. The global community of healthcare workers must focus its substantial influence on changing political and economic policies that foster injustice and AIDS.
