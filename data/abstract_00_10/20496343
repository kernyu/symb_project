A series of twenty new 4-substituted-2,6-dimethyl-3,5-bis-N-(heteroaryl)-carbamoyl-1,4-dihydropyridines have been prepared from a three-component one-pot condensation reaction of N-heteroaryl acetoacetamide, an aromatic/heteroaromatic aldehyde, and ammonium acetate under four different experimental conditions. Except for the conventional method, all the experimental conditions were simple, eco-friendly, economical, and the reactions were rapid and high-yielding. The methods employed have been compared in terms of yields, cost, and simplicity. The synthesized compounds were characterized by different spectroscopic techniques and evaluated for their in-vitro anticancer, antibacterial, and antitubercular activities. Amongst the compounds tested, compound 25 exhibited the highest anticancer activity while compounds 14 and 18 exhibited significant antibacterial and antitubercular activities.
