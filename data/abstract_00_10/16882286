Although quinolones are theoretically interesting candidates for the treatment of brucellosis, the existing data concerning their efficacy are limited and conflicting. A number of small clinical studies with combination regimens that include quinolones have shown adequacy, but not superiority, although cost-effectiveness, excluding certain disease complications, is an important issue. The emergence of quinolone resistance and its implications is another drawback. Experimental data have yielded contradictory results, although most studies do not indicate a bactericidal effect for quinolones. However, in-vitro studies contrast repeatedly with the clinical response, both in terms of clinical failure, despite in-vitro success, and vice versa.
