This consensus statement presents the conclusions of a group of academic and industrial experts who met in London in September, 2006, to consider the issues associated with the treatment of hospital infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. The group discussed the severe clinical problems arising from the emergence of antibiotic resistance in these bacteria and the lack of new antibacterial agents to challenge the threat. The discovery of new drugs active against hospital-acquired Gram-negative bacteria is essential to prevent a future medical and social catastrophe. An important strategy to promote drug discovery will be the development of focused cooperations between academic institutions and small pharmaceutical companies.
