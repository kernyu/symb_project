Bacterial DNA and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (CpG motifs) have been shown to induce potential immune responses. In this study, we designed a recombinant plasmid containing multi-copy CpG motifs, and observed its effects on innate immune responses of fish and prawn. The results showed that such plasmid DNA, compared to the vacant vector, can highly induce the activation of head kidney macrophages and the proliferation of peripheral blood leukocytes in Carassius auratus and Lateolabrax japonicus in vitro, as well as the activity of humoral defense proteins and the antibacterial activity of haemolymph in Litopenaeus vannamei in vivo. It implies that the multi-copy CpG motifs harboured in plasmid could contribute to these innate immunostimulatory effects. Therefore, the study suggested that the plasmid containing multi-copy CpG motifs might have its potential application in improving host resistance to pathogen insults in aquaculture, and have its notable advantages of high efficacy, economical cost and application to a broad range of aquatic species.
