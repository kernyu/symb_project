ACC-4, an omega loop mutant (Val(211)-->Gly) of the Hafnia alvei-derived cephalosporinase ACC-1, was encoded by an Escherichia coli plasmid. The genetic environment of bla(ACC-4) shared similarities with plasmidic regions carrying bla(ACC-1). Kinetics of beta-lactam hydrolysis and levels of resistance to beta-lactams showed that ACC-4 was more effective than ACC-1 against expanded-spectrum cephalosporins.
