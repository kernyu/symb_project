Emerging fungal infections represent a serious problem in an immunocompromised host. Rapid developments in in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing and the availability of several new antifungal agents have provided excellent opportunities to treat infections that are caused by various Candida spp. and to some extend by Aspergillus spp. However, recently the epidemiology of fungal infections has significantly changed and several new pathogens have emerged. This article attempts to summarise the available data on the management of emerging infections with fungal infections that have recently gained importance. Updated recommendations on antifungal treatment are also discussed.
