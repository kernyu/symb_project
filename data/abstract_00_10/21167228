Flaviviruses cause febrile illnesses in humans that may progress to encephalitis and death. Both viral and host factors determine the level of virus replication and outcome of infection. In mice, genetically determined resistance conferred by the flavivirus resistance locus (Flv) is responsible for the restricted flavivirus replication and prevention of disease development. Majority of flaviviruses express significant virulence, replicate to high titers and cause high mortality in susceptible mice, while congenic resistant mice endure the infection, show significantly reduced levels of virus replication and remain healthy. In contrast, infection with West Nile virus subtype Kunjin (KUNV) causes morbidity and fatal outcomes even in mice that are naturally resistant to flaviviruses. There are two possible mechanisms that could account for such an unforeseen virulence of KUNV in resistant mice: (a) an abrogation of Flv-controlled natural resistance leading to high virus replication, or (b) massive virus-induced immunopathology in the brain. To identify the cause(s) of fatality of KUNV infection, disease progression, virus replication and brain histopathology were studied in parallel in resistant and congenic susceptible mice. While KUNV replicated to high titers causing early fatalities in susceptible mice, it showed only reduced replication associated with the delayed morbidity in resistant mice indicating no abrogation of the Flv resistance. No evidence of excessive immune cell infiltration and tissue damage following KUNV infection were found. However, incomplete KUNV clearance not previously described was perceived as an important source of pathogenesis in resistant mice.
