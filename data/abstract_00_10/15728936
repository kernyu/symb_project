Genotypic analysis of 103 multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated in Germany in 2001 revealed that mutations in codon 531 (75.7%) of the rpoB gene and codon 315 (88.4%) of the katG gene are most frequent. Beijing genotype strains (60.2% of all isolates) displayed a different distribution of resistance mutations than non-Beijing strains.
