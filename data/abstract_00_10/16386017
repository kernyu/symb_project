This study reports the drug resistance and clonal relationship of 24 Staphylococcus aureus community acquired isolates from patients attending Maputo Central Hospital, Mozambique, during one year (2002-2003). All the isolates produced beta-lactamase, six strains were resistant to tetracycline alone, three were resistant to erythromycin alone and one was resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; 11 were susceptible to all other drugs tested. Only one strain showed a multiple resistance pattern, including methicillin resistance. To investigate the clonal relationships we applied the ERIC AP-PCR and the SmaI PFGE RFLP methods. Overlapping drug resistances with these two molecular profiles, no significant correlation was obtained. The emergence of methicillin resistance in a multiple resistant strain is of great concern for resistance spreading surveillance in Mozambique.
