PURPOSE: To analyse the in-vitro efficacy of commonly used antibacterials against bacterial pathogens from corneal ulcers. METHODS: We evaluated 596 patients seen over 18 months, period, September 1999 through March 2001. Corneal scrapings were subjected to microscopy and cultures using standard protocols. Antibacterial susceptibility of isolated bacteria were determined by the Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion method. RESULTS: 626 bacterial pathogens were isolated from 596 corneal ulcer cases. 411(65.65%) were gram positive cocci Streptococcus pneumoniae (41.85%) was the predominant bacterial species. The antibacterial susceptibility was: 451(72.04%) to cefazolin, 471(75.24%) to chloramphenicol; 321(51.28%) to cephaloridine; 430(68.69%) to vancomycin; 564(90.09%) to ciprofloxacin; 429(68.53%) to norfloxacin; 464(74.12%) to gentamicin and 202(32.27%) to co.trimoxazole. CONCLUSION: This study provides information on the efficacy of ocular antibacterials commonly used against bacterial pathogens of keratitis. It is hoped that this information will help decision-making in empiric initial treatment of bacterial keratitis.
