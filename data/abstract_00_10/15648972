The emergence, in recent years, of microbial resistance to commonly used antibiotics has aroused a search for new naturally occurring bactericidal and fungicidal agents that may have clinical utility. In the present study, three new antimicrobial peptides were purified from the electrical-stimulated skin secretion of the South American frog Leptodactylus ocellatus by reversed-phase chromatographic procedures. Ocellatin 1 (1GVVDILKGAGKDLLAHLVGKISEKV25-CONH2), ocellatin 2 (1GVLDIFKDAAKQILAHAAEKQI25-CONH2) and ocellatin 3 (1GVLDILKNAAKNILAHAAEQI21-CONH2) are structurally related peptides. These peptides present hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and are also active against Escherichia coli. Ocellatins exhibit significant sequence similarity to other amphibian antimicrobial peptides, mainly to brevinin 2ED from Rana esculenta.
