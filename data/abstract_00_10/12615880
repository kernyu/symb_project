OBJECTIVES: Chronic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in debilitated patients are difficult to treat. We studied the clinical efficacy and safety of an oral streptogramin, pristinamycin, for these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were admitted consecutively to receive pristinamycin, usually with doxycycline, for 7-21 days. Fifty-six patients (average age 75 years) from hospital and community were treated for skin, soft tissue, chest and other infections. RESULTS: The overall clinical response rate was 39 of 53 patients (74%; 95% CI: 60%, 85%) cured or substantially improved, from 53 of 56 (95%) patients clinically and 49 of 56 (87.5%) patients bacteriologically evaluable. Toxic effects comprised gastrointestinal disturbances in eight patients (14%) and one (2%) possible skin rash. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that oral streptogramins may be useful in the management of debilitated patients with MRSA infections.
