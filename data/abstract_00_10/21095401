STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Cast posts require sufficient length for prosthesis retention and root strength. For prefabricated metal and fiber posts, the effects of different post lengths on the strength and internal stress of the surrounding root need evaluation. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine, using both experimental and finite element (FE) approaches, the influence of post material and length on the mechanical response of endodontically treated teeth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty extracted incisors were endodontically treated and then restored with 1 of 3 prefabricated posts: stainless steel (SS), carbon fiber (CF), and glass fiber (GF), with intraradicular lengths of either 5 or 10 mm (n=10). After composite resin core and crown restorations, these teeth were thermal cycled and then loaded to fracture in an oblique direction. Statistical analysis was performed for the effects of post material and length on failure loads using 2-way ANOVA (alpha=.05). In addition, corresponding FE models of an incisor restored with a post were developed to examine mechanical responses. The simulated tooth was loaded with a 100-N oblique force to analyze the stress in the root dentin. RESULTS: The SS/5 mm and all fiber post groups presented no statistical differences, with mean (SD) fracture loads of 1247 to 1339 (53 to 121) N. The SS/10 mm group exhibited a lower fracture load, 973 (115) N, and a higher incidence of unfavorable root fracture (P<.05). The FE analysis showed high stress around the apical end of the long SS post, while stress was concentrated around the crown margins in the fiber post groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both long and short fiber posts provided root fracture resistance comparable to that of SS posts. For metal posts, extending the post length does not effectively prevent root fracture in restored teeth.
