Two hundred and four Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) isolates were collected from seven Asian countries during 2002-2004. Multidrug-resistant S. Typhi (resistant to > or = 3 antibiotics) was detected in 84 (41.2%) isolates and 142 (69.6%) showed reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration=0.125-1.0 mg/l). This study highlights the worsening situation of antimicrobial resistance of S. Typhi in Asia.
