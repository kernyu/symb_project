BACKGROUND: Pemphigus vulgaris is a severe autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes. In absence of treatment, mortality is high. In the past, prednisolone was the best treatment. Later, combination therapy with systemic prednisolone and other disease-modifying drugs was tried with better results. Unfortunately, some patients do not respond well to such treatment, or may exhibit multiple recurrences or complications. Some other patients may remain on high dose corticosteroids to maintain remission. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil as a steroid sparing agent in the treatment of resistant pemphigus vulgaris. METHODS: We administered 2 g daily mycophenolate mofetil with systemic steroids to 10 patients with resistant and severe disease who did not respond to conventional therapy, or had multiple recurrences. RESULTS: Nine of the ten patients responded to treatment and showed complete clearance of lesions within 6 to 16 weeks of therapy. At the end of six months, the dose of prednisolone was significantly lower. Side effects were few and mild. After discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil, 5 of the 9 patients relapsed. CONCLUSION: Mycophenolate mofetil is effective and safe as a disease-modifying drug combined with prednisolone in the treatment of patients with resistant pemphigus vulgaris. To induce long lasting remission has to be administrated for more than 6 months.
