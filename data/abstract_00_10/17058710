This study aims to determine the in vitro susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori to clarithromycin, metronidazole, amoxycillin and tetracycline, the four antibiotics commonly used in eradication therapies. These data are used to evaluate the efficacy of current empiric treatment of H. pylori infection in the Southern Region of Ireland. Culture is performed on gastric biopsy samples obtained from 147 consecutive patients undergoing gastroscopy for investigation of dyspepsia. Susceptibility testing to metronidazole, clarithromycin, amoxycillin and tetracycline is performed on the isolates by Etest. Isolates demonstrating clarithromycin resistance are subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and nucleotide sequence analysis to identify the presence of point mutations in the peptidyltransferase region of the 23S rRNA gene previously associated with resistance to clarithromycin. Prevalence of H. pylori in the population studied was 31% (45 isolates). Antimicrobial resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin was detected in nine (20%) and four (8.9%) of the isolates, respectively. A single isolate demonstrated co-resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin (2.2%). No resistance was detected to either amoxycillin or tetracycline. The low level of resistance demonstrated among this group of isolates indicates that the empiric treatment currently in place in the Southern Region of Ireland is likely to be successful.
