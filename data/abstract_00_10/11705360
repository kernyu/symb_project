Among the different classes and complexities of antiretroviral regimens, maximal viral suppression, sustained durability, increased CD4 count, decreased evolving resistance, and fewer side effects combined with increased compliance resulting in decreased morbidity and mortality remain the goals of therapy. Serial viral load measurements help best guide the direction of therapy. According to the CDC 20% fewer people died of HIV in 1998 compared to 1997 in the United States. HAART, although expensive (sometimes exceeding $20,000 per year), is not readily available to 95% of the estimated 36 million HIV-infected people in the world. HAART therapy commonly consists of two NRTIs and a protease inhibitor, but other combination regimens exist. The disadvantage of HAART therapy is that antiretroviral agents are not virucidal, thus eradication with these drug cocktails cannot be achieved. When HAART therapy is stopped, viral loads return to pre-treatment levels. New drug classes under investigation may completely prevent fusion between the HIV virus and healthy cells. For now, the epidemic can only be controlled with good public awareness, such as education, condom use, or abstinence. Because a cure does not seem immediately foreseeable, an effective prophylactic vaccine may afford protection. Defined treatment regimens exist for occupational postexposure prophylaxis. Ultimately, an expert in the field should be involved in manipulating drug regimens; however, dermatologists remain an integral part of the health care team because most HIV patients experience cutaneous manifestations related either to their HIV or to their drug therapy.
