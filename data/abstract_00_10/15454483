Resistance to fludarabine is observed in the clinic, and molecular predictive assays for benefit from chemotherapy are required. Our objective was to determine if expression of nucleoside transport and metabolism genes was associated with response to fludarabine therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL cells from 56 patients were collected prior to treatment with fludarabine. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on sample RNA to determine the relative levels of mRNA of 3 nucleoside transporters that mediate fludarabine uptake (human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 [hENT1], human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 [hENT2], and human concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 [hCNT3]), deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), and 3 5'-nucleotidases (ecto-5'nucleotidase [CD73], deoxynucleotidase-1 [dNT-1], and cytoplasmic high-Km 5-nucleotidase [CN-II]). Two-dimensional hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression identified 2 distinct populations of CLL. Cluster 2 patients experienced a 3.4-fold higher risk of disease progression than cluster 1 patients (P = .0058, log-rank analysis). Furthermore, independent analysis of the individual genes of interest revealed statistically significant differences for risk of disease progression (adjusted hazard ratios [HRs]) with underexpression of dNT-1 (HR = 0.45; P = .042), CD73 (HR = 0.40; P = .022), and dCK (HR = 0.0.48; P = .035), and overexpression of hCNT3 (HR = 4.7; P = .0007) genes. Subjects with elevated hCNT3 expression experienced a lower complete response rate to fludarabine therapy (11% vs 69%; P = .002). No hCNT3-mediated plasma membrane nucleoside transport was detected in CLL samples expressing hCNT3 message, and hCNT3 protein was localized to the cytoplasm with immunohistochemical and confocal microscopy.
