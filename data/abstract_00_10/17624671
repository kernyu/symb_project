The animal pathogenic protozoan, Trypanosoma evansi, leads to a wasting disease in equines, cattle and camels, commonly known as Surra. It is extensively distributed geographically with a wide range of mammalian hosts and causes great economical loss. Trypanosoma equiperdum causes a venereal disease called Dourine in horses and donkeys. Chemotherapy appears to be the most effective form of control for T. evansi, whereas infections caused by T. equiperdum are considered incurable. Due to emerging drug resistance, efficient control of T. evansi is severely threatened, emphasising the urgent need to find new alternative drugs. A drug profile for a panel of T. evansi and T. equiperdum strains has been established for the four standard drugs currently used in treatment. The (3)H-hypoxanthine incorporation assay was used to obtain 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values for each standard drug against the various strains. The results indicate the presence (and in some cases, the emergence) of drug resistance in several strains. This panel of characterised strains with known drug sensitivities and resistances will be of great value for the screening of new active compounds, in comparison with the four standard drugs currently available.
