Patients undergoing full haplotype-mismatched hematopoietic transplantations may experience severe intractable invasive fungal infections. To verify whether an imbalanced production of T-helper 1 (TH1) and TH2 cytokines may be responsible for susceptibility to fungal infections, C3H/HeJ (H-2(k)) recipient mice were lethally irradiated, received transplantations with T-cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow (BM) cells from mice of H-2(d) haplotype, and were infected with Candida albicans. At different time-points after transplantation, mice were assessed for pattern of TH cytokine production and susceptibility to infection. The results show that a long-term, donor-type chimerism was achieved as early as 2 weeks after BM transplantation (BMT), at the time when high-level production of TH2 cytokines (interleukin-4 [IL-4] and IL-10) and impaired production of TH1 cytokines (interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma] and IL-12] were observed. At this time, mice were highly susceptible to both disseminated and mucosal infections, as indicated by decreased survival, uncontrolled fungal growth, and failure to develop protective TH1 immunity. However, a predominant production of TH1 cytokines was observed by week 5 after BMT, at the time when mice developed donor-type protective TH1 responses and were resistant to infections. Therapeutic ablation of IL-4 or IL-10 greatly increased resistance to candidiasis. These results indicate that a dysregulated production of TH cytokines occurs in mice undergoing T-cell-depleted allogeneic BMT. The transient predominant production of TH2 cytokines over that of IL-12 impaired the ability of mice to develop antifungal TH1 resistance, an activity that could be efficiently restored upon treatment with TH2 cytokine antagonists.
