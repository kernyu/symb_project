An attempt has been made to study antimicrobial resistance among the coliforms, faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci isolated from the runoff of the Gangotri glacier. The number of multiple antibiotic resistances (MAR) coliform isolates increases from upper stretch (33.33%) to lower stretch (83.33%). All faecal coliforms (100%) and faecal streptococci (100%) of lower stretch of study area showed multiple antibiotic resistances. Among coliforms, the value of Antibiotic resistance index (ARI) was found maximum in lower stretch (0.34) followed by middle stretch (0.29) and upper stretch (0.25).
