Among the collection strains of S. flexneri 10.5; 5.5; 2.6; 2.6 and 7.9% of strains were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, ceftryaxon, cefasoline, chloramphenycol, respectively. The maximum number of R-determinants of one strain was 4. The strains resistant to cefalosporynes were not revealed; among newly isolated strains of this agent, these strains resistant to ampicilline, tetracycline and chloramphenycol made 20%. Among the collection and newly isolated strains of S. flexneri, isolated 50 and more years ago, the part of colicinogenic ones was 10%. And, on the contrary both for the collection and newly isolated strains of S. sonnei colicinogenic activity is specific biological property (above 80%). Correlation relation between two tested pathogenic factors, certain serovars and biovars of the agents, was not revealed.
