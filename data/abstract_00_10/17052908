A targeted series of phenolic Mannich bases of benzaldehyde and (thio)semicarbazone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated in vitro against the malarial cysteine protease falcipain-2 and a chloroquine resistant strain (W2) of Plasmodium falciparum. A novel series of 4-aminoquinoline semicarbazones were the most effective inhibitors of falcipain-2 (most potent inhibitor had IC(50)=0.63microM) while a bisquinoline semicarbazone compound 8f was the most potent antimalarial compound with an IC(50) of 0.07microM against W2. Compound 8f also weakly inhibited falcipain-2, with an IC(50) of 3.16microM, although its principal antiparasitic activity did not appear to be due to inhibition of this enzyme.
