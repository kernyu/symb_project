A main target of specifically targeted antiviral therapy for hepatitis C (STAT-C) is the NS3-protease, which has key functions in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication cycle. HCV/NS3-protease inhibitors have shown high antiviral activity in vitro and in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Protease-resistant HCV variants occurred rapidly in patients receiving protease-inhibitor monotherapy. The development of resistance can be best explained by selection of preexisting resistant variants, which grow out under selective pressure. Numerous mutations associated with resistance were identified. Clinical trials showed that protease-resistant strains are sensitive to interferon and that a triple combination of protease inhibitors, peginterferon, and ribavirin may improve the sustained virologic response rate compared with standard peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy. Overall, it can be anticipated that successful treatment with protease inhibitors will require either combination therapy with peginterferon/ribavirin or a combination of STAT-C compounds with distinct modes of action and resistance patterns.
