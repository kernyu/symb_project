The in vitro activities of GAR-936, the 9-t-butylglycylamido derivative of minocycline, were compared with those of doxycycline, minocycline, and tetracycline against 527 gram-positive clinical isolates. GAR-936 inhibited all strains, including those resistant to other tetracyclines, at concentrations of </=2 microg/ml, except two strains of JK diphtheroids for which the MIC was 4 microg/ml.
