Carbapenem-resistant or intermediate (MIC >or=1 mg/L) clinical isolates (n = 12) of three species of Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca and Escherichia coli) were characterized. The isolates harboured integrons containing the VIM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase gene together with other resistance gene cassettes. In particular, the CTX-M-2 gene was detected in four of the K. pneumoniae isolates. The patient population was mostly paediatric and characterized by severe underlying illnesses that involved long-term hospitalization, major surgery and/or immunosuppressive and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.
