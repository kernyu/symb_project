Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections are common bacterial sexually transmitted diseases. Men will usually experience lower urinary tract symptons attributed to urethritis, epididymitis, proctitis, or prostatitis, with associated mucopurulent urethral discharge. Many women are asymptomatic. But, occasionally, they have symptons of vaginal and pelvic discomfort of dysuria, and these infections can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease. Recentry, high prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates resistant to antimicrobial agents is a serious problem in the treatment of gonorrhea. For example, in Fukuoka city, Japan, the proportion of the isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin (CPFX) were 73.4% in 2006 and it was still so high. The proportion of the isolates resistant to tetracycline (TC) was 38.5% in 2006 and that of isolates resistant to penicillin G (PCG) was 17.5%. Owing to this high prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Japan, the clinical efficacy rates of oral antimicrobial agents have become lower. So, as first-line therapy for gonococcal infections, only three parenteral regimens of single doses of ceftriaxone, cefodizime or spectinomycin are recommended by the Japanese Society for Sexually Transmitted Diseases. In the circumstances, we studied in vitro activity of combinations of oral agents such as, beta-lactam and azithromycin, fluoroquinolone and azithromycin, or beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone against Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The cefixime+azithromycin combination demonstrated greater synergy than other combinations.
