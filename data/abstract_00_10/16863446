Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of HIV infection. It is a potent agent with a long intracellular half-life that allows for once-daily dosing. It has been well tolerated in clinical trials, without evidence of the mitochondrial toxicity that has been associated with long-term treatment of some of the nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Because of its demonstrated efficacy and favourable safety profile, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has quickly become a favoured nucleoside component of antiretroviral regimens for both treatment-naive and -experienced patients.
