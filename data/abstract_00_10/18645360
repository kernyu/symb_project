Recently, the existence of a relationship was reported between the severity of lung injury and the serum level of F2-isoprostane, a known oxidative stress marker. Recent reports have suggested that direct hemoperfusion with a polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column (DHP-PMX) may improve the oxygenation in patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Because cases of septic shock associated with respiratory diseases have poor outcomes, we selected cases of septic shock associated with respiratory disease to review the characteristics of the treatment-resistant cases. We treated 13 septic shock cases due to respiratory disease using DHP-PMX. The patients were separated into 2 groups for analysis from oxygenation effect immediately after DHP-PMX: A group (7 cases) PaO2/FiO2 ratio increased more than 20%; B group (6 cases) PaO2/FiO2 ratio did not increase more than 20%. Factors were measured before DHP-PMX. The average Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 31.2 +/- 9.4, and the average sequential organ failure assessment score was 15.1 +/- 5.3 before DHP-PMX. Four patients survived and 9 died. Only the F2-Isoprostane level was significantly high in B group (p = 0.0228). A relationship between F2-Isoplostane and rebellious cases by DHP-PMX in severe respiratory disease patients became clear.
