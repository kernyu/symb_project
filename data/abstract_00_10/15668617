BACKGROUND: Despite the progressive increase of antimicrobial resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae worldwide, there are limited reports of alternative remedies from plants. GOAL: The aim of the current study was to screen 3 plants, Ocimum sanctum, Drynaria quercifolia, and Annona squamosa, for activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae. STUDY: By disc diffusion method, extracts of these 3 plants were screened for activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae; their antimicrobial activity was calculated as percentage inhibition and compared with penicillin and ciprofloxacin. RESULTS: The extracts of all 3 plants caused inhibition of Neisseria gonorrhoeae clinical isolates and World Health Organization (WHO) strains, more so than the multidrug resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. CONCLUSION: Neisseria gonorrhoeae clinical isolates and WHO strains were sensitive to extracts of Ocimum sanctum, Drynaria quercifolia, and Annona squamosa. This motivates us to isolate the active component/second from the 3 plants.
