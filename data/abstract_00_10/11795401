Africa has the highest incidence rate per capita of tuberculosis, although the rate varies among the African countries from 17.8% in Cameroon to 70% in Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Nevertheless, the levels of drug resistance are relatively low, compared to countries like Russia and Estonia. Because treatment of MDR TB is beyond the reach of most African countries, prevention of the development of resistance should be a major priority. Establishment of programs to ensure prompt diagnosis of TB and adequate treatment with supervision should be undertaken by national governments with cooperating partners.
