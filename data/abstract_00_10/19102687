The use of single dose nevirapine to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV has been reported to induce drug-resistant mutations and reduce options for antiretroviral treatment for HIV-infected mothers and their children. To explore the status of nevirapine-resistant HIV genotypes in rural hospitals in the North Rift Valley Province of Kenya, samples collected 3 months after single dose nevirapine from 36 mothers and their children were analyzed. Resistance mutations were genotypically evaluated through proviral DNA amplification, cloning, and sequencing. Ten mothers (27.8%) had antiretroviral-associated resistance mutations of whom four (11.1%) had specific nevirapine (NNRTI) resistance-associated mutations. Three mothers (8.3%) transmitted the infection to their infants. This presence of nevirapine mutations in rural antenatal clinic attendees confirms the importance of integrating antiretroviral resistance monitoring as a key component in programs geared to prevention of HIV mother-to-child transmission.
