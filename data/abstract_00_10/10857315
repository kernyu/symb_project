During experiment in vitro and in the clinical environment in patients with the mandibula fracture there were studied up antimicrobic action of the ozonized distilled water, the ozone concentration in which had constituted 0.3 mg/l. Ozonecontaining solution was used in the form of small baths and gargles instead of conventional antiseptic solutions. While local application the pronounced antimicrobic action of ozone was noted. Additionally there was established immunomodulating action of ozone on the local immunity factors in oral cavity, demonstrated by the rise of the secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) level and by lowering of the serum immunoglobulins in saliva. This had witnessed the rise of resistance and lowering of expression of the mucosal inflammatory changes. In patients, to whom the conventional treatment was done, the immunologic indexes dynamics was opposite, witnessing presence in them posttraumatic immunodepression. The comparison of data, obtained in the clinic and in experiment, permits to suggest, that antimicrobic action of ozone is mostly mediated via the local immunity activization.
