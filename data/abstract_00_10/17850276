OBJECTIVES: To assess the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from corneal ulcers in cats. METHODS: A total of 92 cats with infected corneal ulcers were swabbed for bacterial culture and the antibiotic sensitivity of the isolates analysed. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated from 54 of 92 infected eyes with corneal ulcers and purulent discharge. A total of 59 bacterial isolates were obtained from the 54 ulcers. The ratio of Gram-positive to Gram-negative isolates was approximately 3:1. The most commonly isolated Gram-positive bacteria were Staphylococcus species (51 per cent of all isolates), while Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.5 per cent of all isolates) was the most common Gram-negative bacteria isolated. The Gram-negative isolates demonstrated a greater incidence of antibiotic resistance than the Gram-positive ones. The most effective antibiotics against the isolates were ciprofloxacin, tobramycin and gentamicin, with erythromycin and lincomycin showing the greatest number of resistant isolates. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas species were the most common Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively, isolated from feline eyes with ulcerative keratitis. The second-generation fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin and the aminoglycoside gentamicin were found to be highly effective against the majority of isolates.
