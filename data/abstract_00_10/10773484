Increased frequency of multidrug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis results from inappropriate treatment and lack of patient compliance. The Center for Disease Control/American Thoracic Society (CDC/ATS) guidelines issued for the management of newly diagnosed cases of tuberculosis (TB) will not be totally effective regardless of adherence to the guidelines and patient cooperation. The long interim period between the diagnosis of TB and confirmation of antibiotic susceptibility contributes to the infection rate. Consequently, the use of an adjuvant that is known to inhibit all encountered multidrug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis may be helpful until antibiotic susceptibility is known. Phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine, methdilazine and thioridazine are effective against strains of M. tuberculosis in vitro and in vivo. It is recommended that studies be designed and conducted for the purpose of managing new cases of TB that emanate from areas known to harbour multidrug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, with phenothiazines as adjuvants to the regimen recommended by the CDC/ATS guidelines until antibiotic susceptibility is defined. Because the normal maximum period for obtaining conventional antibiotic susceptibility results is less than 7 or 8 weeks, the probability of serious side effects from the use of a phenothiazine is remote.
