Alanine scanning of motif A in the pJHCMW1-encoded aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferase type Ib identified amino acids important for the ability of the enzyme to confer wild-type levels of resistance to kanamycin and amikacin. The replacement of two amino acids, D117 or L120, with alanine residues resulted in complete loss of the resistance phenotype.
