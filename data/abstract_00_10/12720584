Capric (10:0) and lauric (12:0) acid and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) have been shown to increase paracellular permeability across human intestinal-like Caco-2 cell monolayers. While this has generated interest in terms of improved drug absorption and delivery, little has been done in terms of their potential effect on nutrient transport across the intestinal epithelium. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of these fatty acids on transepithelial Ca transport in Caco-2 cells. Cells were seeded onto permeable transport membranes and allowed to differentiate, over 21 d, into intestinal-like cell monolayers. Monolayers (n 9 per treatment) were exposed to 0 (control) or 80 microm-10:0, 80 microm-12:0, 80 microm-18:2, 80 microm-CLA (mixed isomers), 80 microm-cis-9,trans-11 CLA or 80 microm-trans-10,cis-12 CLA for 22 d after seeding (chronic effect) or for 24 h before Ca transport studies (acute effect) on day 22. After exposure, transepithelial and transcellular transport of 45Ca, fluorescein transport (a marker of paracellular Ca transport) and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER, an indicator of permeability) were measured. Overall Ca transport and TEER in Caco-2 cells were unaffected by exposure to any of the fatty acids for 24 h, or to 18:2, CLA blend or cis-9,trans-11 CLA for 22 d. Paracellular (but not total transepithelial and transcellular) Ca transport across Caco-2 cells was significantly increased (P<0.01, by about 1.5-fold relative to the control value) by exposure to 10:0, 12:0 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA for 22 d, suggesting that these non-esterified fatty acids could potentially enhance Ca absorption in vivo.
