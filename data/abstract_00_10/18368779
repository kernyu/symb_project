Isolation and characterization of the influenza virus A/H5N1 strains, isolated from chicken in the Yandovka village (Tula Region) and from wild swan near the orifice of the Volga River that died during an outbreak of avian flu in autumn 2005, were carried out. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses were performed. The goals of the analysis were to determine possible geographical origin of the strain, genetic similarity of isolated strains to earlier sequenced isolates, epidemic potential, existence of pathogenicity markers, and resistance to antiviral drugs. It was shown that the isolated influenza virus belonged to highly pathogenic variants of China origin by a reassortment of viruses genotypes Z and V circulated in poultry and wild birds. A number of molecular markers of pathogenicity to gallinaceous birds and mammals were found out. Mutations in the hemagglutinin gene promoting potentially high rate of replication in humans as well as mutations causing the resistance to amantadine/rimantadine were not found. The strain isolated from wild swan had the mutation causing resistance to tamiflu/ozeltamivir.
