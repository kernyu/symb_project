The serotype distribution of 781 nasopharyngeal pneumococcal isolates recovered from 2448 unselected children aged 2-23 months was studied. Only 3.9% of the children for whom cultures were performed attended day care centers. The proportions of pneumococcal isolates that belonged to serotypes related to the 7-, 9- and 11-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine were 65%, 66%, and 70%, respectively. The pneumococcal carriage rate among untreated children was 34%; the rates among children treated with antibiotics during the periods 1-30 or 31-60 days before the time of nasopharyngeal sampling were 25% and 36%, respectively. There was a significant positive association between antimicrobial use and carriage of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci, which belonged mainly to vaccine-related serotypes. The proportion of isolates that belonged to vaccine-related serotypes in untreated carriers was 72%; however, the proportions in carriers treated 1-30 days or 31-60 days before sampling were 66% and 56%, respectively. In the nasopharynx, antimicrobial use selects for antibiotic-resistant pneumococci, mainly of vaccine-related serotypes, whereas it may promote an increase in the frequency of colonization with nonvaccine serotypes.
