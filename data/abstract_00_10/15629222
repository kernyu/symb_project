During 2001, occurrences of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were detected in a single medical center (Hospital A) from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program that became endemic in long-term acute care areas and in the intensive care unit in 2002-2003. Between 2001 and 2003, 123 patients were infected or colonized with ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae. Resistance profiles were determined by reference broth microdilution methods, and automated ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were performed. The ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to aztreonam, ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and susceptible to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline. In 1997, 1998, and 2000, 9 ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains from 2 New York City hospitals shared the same antibiograms and ribotype (204.2) as the strains from Hospital A. PFGE patterns divided Hospital A isolates into 2 subtypes (A and A1) and 3 New York City strains were similar to the Hospital A isolates (A2, A3, and A4). Isoelectric focusing studies of 1 New York City isolate (A4) revealed pIs at 5.4, 7.7, and 8.2. PCR and sequencing results from 1 strain of each Hospital A and 1 New York PFGE pattern determined that TEM-1 and SHV-5 (ESBL) were present in all strains. In addition, 2 New York isolates from 1998 (A3 and A4) also had an OXA-2 enzyme. ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates with ribotype 204.2 from SENTRY Program sites have been recognized in New York only since 1997 and in Hospital A beginning in 2001. The similarities of the antibiogram and epidemiological patterns suggest that these isolates have persisted over time and may have evolved into different but genetically related endemic ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae clones that have the ability to cause sustained epidemic outbreaks in US medical centers.
