The in vitro activity of ertapenem was tested against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated in Spain. Ertapenem activity was similar to that of imipenem and meropenem and better than that of the other antimicrobials tested. No differences in activity were observed regarding the origin of the isolates or type of ESBL produced.
