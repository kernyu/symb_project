OBJECTIVE: To study the curative effect of surgical treatment of drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis. METHODS: From March 2005 and April 2009, the clinical data of 60 patients with drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis were retrospectively analyzed. Including 36 males and 24 females; aged from 5 to 79 years with an average of 47.3 years. Thirty-four patients had neurological deficits, among them, 2 cases were grade A, 5 cases were grade B, 13 cases were grade C, 14 cases were grade D according to ASIA standard. According to the severity and location of the infection, the patients underwent anterior, posterolateral costotransversectomy or posterior debridement and bone grafting and internal fixation. The antituberculous chemotherapy for a total of 12 to 18 months was guided by conventional and genotypic drug susceptibility testing. Tubercular relapse, neurological function, spinal fusion were observed by ASIA grade, X-ray and CT scan. RESULTS: All cases were followed up from 1 to 5 years with an average of 3.1 years. Recurrence was found in 2 cases who were cured after second operation. 34 cases with neurological deficits recovered totally or partially. X-ray or CT films showed spinal fusion in 57 patients. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic effect of individuall operative options is good in treating drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis after antituberculous chemotherapy based on conventional and genotypic drug susceptibility testing.
