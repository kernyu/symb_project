Across-sectional study was performed of pediatric hematology-oncology patients who received vancomycin; use was compared to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for vancomycin use. Thirty-seven patients received 308 doses of vancomycin. AR patients initially received vancomycin as empirical therapy; 100% of this use was not consistent with the CDC recommendations.
