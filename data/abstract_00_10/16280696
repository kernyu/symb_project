BACKGROUND: Abacavir (ABC) and lamivudine (3TC) administered twice daily were compared with an ABC + 3TC fixed-dose combination (Epzicom, Kivexa; EPZ) administered once daily, both in combination with a protease inhibitor (PI) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). METHODS: Two hundred sixty HIV-infected subjects with more than 6 months of ABC and 3TC administered twice daily plus a PI or NNRTI with an HIV-1 RNA level less than 400 copies/mL for more than 3 months and a CD4 count greater than 50 cells/mm were randomized 1:1 to ABC + 3TC administered twice daily or EPZ administered once daily. RESULTS: At baseline, median time on ABC and 3TC administered twice daily was 22 months, and median CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA level were 554 cells/mm and <50 copies/mL, respectively. EPZ administered once daily was established as not inferior to ABC + 3TC administered twice daily based on the proportion of nonvirologic failures (confirmed HIV-1 RNA level > or =1265 copies/mL; 90% confidence interval: -3.4 to 6.4; (intent to treat [ITT]: missing [M] = failure [F]). Proportions with an HIV-1 RNA level <50 copies/mL were 81% of those taking EPZ once daily and 82% of those taking ABC + 3TC twice daily at week 48 (ITT: M = F). Virologic failure was rare (2 patients taking the once-daily regimen, 4 patients taking the twice-daily regimen). There was a low incidence of grade 2 through 4 adverse events (AEs) and no drug-related serious AEs or hypersensitivity reactions. CONCLUSIONS: EPZ administered once daily was established as not inferior to ABC + 3TC administered twice daily in a regimen containing an NNRTI or a PI over 48 weeks. A dual-nucleoside backbone of ABC and 3TC administered once or twice daily is effective, durable, and well tolerated.
