A consequence of oxidative stress is DNA damage. The survival of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the inflammatory microenvironment of the periodontal pocket requires an ability to overcome oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) is typical of oxidative damage induced by ROS. There is no information on the presence of 8-oxoG in P. gingivalis under oxidative stress conditions or on a putative mechanism for its repair. High-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection analysis of chromosomal DNA revealed higher levels of 8-oxoG in P. gingivalis FLL92, a nonpigmented isogenic mutant, than in the wild-type strain. 8-oxoG repair activity was also increased in cell extracts from P. gingivalis FLL92 compared to those from the parent strain. Enzymatic removal of 8-oxoG was catalyzed by a nucleotide excision repair (NER)-like mechanism rather than the base excision repair (BER) observed in Escherichia coli. In addition, in comparison with other anaerobic periodontal pathogens, the removal of 8-oxoG was unique to P. gingivalis. Taken together, the increased 8-oxoG levels in P. gingivalis FLL92 could further support a role for the hemin layer as a unique mechanism in oxidative stress resistance in this organism. In addition, this is the first observation of an NER-like mechanism as the major mechanism for removal of 8-oxoG in P. gingivalis.
