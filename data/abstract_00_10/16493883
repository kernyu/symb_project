Antibiotic sensitivity of 30 strains of bifidobacteria isolated from various ecologic sources has been investigated. All the studied strains of bifidobacteria were sensitive to nitrofurans, macrolides, linkosamides. Bifidobacteria strains isolated from people and farm animals displayed more frequently resistance to fusidine, cefasoline and doxycycline compared with the strains which were isolated from other natural sources. Most of the studied strains of bifidobacteria were resistant to oxacylline. Representatives of the species Bifidobacterium liberorum, B. catenulatum, B. bifidum, B. adolescentis, B. breve, B. ruminale and B. globosum were most resistant to the studied antibiotics.
