Isolation frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae isolated in Saga University hospital from October 2002 to September 2003 were investigated. Out of 155 H. influenzae strains subjected 77 were isolated from pediatrics specimens. beta-Lactamase negative ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR), against which MICs of ABPC were higher than 4 microg/mL, were 32 strains (20.6%), and it became 63 strains (41.3%) when Low-BLNAR, against which MICs of ABPC were higher than 2 microg/mL, were included. beta-Lactamase positive ABPC-resistant H. influenzae (BLPAR) were 8 strains (5.2%). Although those BLNAR were also resistant to variety of beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics were not affected by the level of ABPC-resistance. Resistant strains of BLPAR against SBT/ABPC, a combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor, were detected but all of them were sensitive to TAZ/PIPC, an another combination. Those strains were able to be considered as beta-lactamase positive amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant H. influenzae (BLPACR). PIPC, TAZ/PIPC, CTRX, CDTR, MEPM, LVFX and CPFX showed good activity among tested antibiotics.
