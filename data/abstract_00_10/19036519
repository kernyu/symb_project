Triclabendazole "Fasinex" is the drug of choice against fasciolosis because of its high efficacy against both mature and immature flukes, however parasite resistance against this drug is increasing. Hence, there is pressing need for new fasciolicidal drugs. In the present study, the in vitro effect of artemether on adult flukes was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. After 24 h incubation with 10 microg/ml artemether, the tegument of the apical cone appeared to be slightly more swollen than normal. This swelling became so severe and the spines appeared sunken, with their tips protruding from a swollen and blebbed base, on increasing the concentration to 20 microg/ml. With the higher concentration of 30 microg/ml, extensive and severe tegumental swelling occurred in the apical cone region of the flukes. There were many blebs around ventral sucker, a number of which appeared to have burst causing lesion. The tegumental changes occurred following incubation in artemether were comparable with those observed with triclabendazole in its active sulphoxide metabolite form (TCBZ-SX).
