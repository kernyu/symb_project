Both disk diffusion and broth micro-dilution assays were employed to determine the level of resistance in Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) isolates (n = 170) obtained from preweaning piglet colibacillosis from the two different pig production systems (commercial piggeries and small holder farmers) in Vietnam. Overall, tetracycline, streptomycin, amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol showed markedly higher rates of resistance. Both apramycin and ceftiofur are active against all ETEC isolates. These antimicrobials could be recommended as the drugs of choice for the treatment of E. coli infections in young pigs in North Vietnam. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporin (ceftiofur, ceftazidime, and cefoxitin) was not observed in Vietnamese ETEC isolates. Multiple resistances to greater than three antimicrobials were widely distributed (approximately 79.4%).
