Ingavirin is low toxic for the MDCK cell culture. The drug concentration of 1000 mcg/ml does not reach the CD50 value. The antiviral activity of Ingavirin was studied with respect to the influenza virus A/H1N1, including the Remantadin resistant variant, in 1-7 subcultutes. In multiple contamination by 0.01 CPD50/ml Ingavirin in concentrations of 250 to 400 mcg/ml prevented development of the virus-induced CPE. Analogous results were recorded with respect to the Remantadin resistant variant of the influenza virus A/H1N1. In the same concentrations the drug affected the virus reproduction, evident from inhibition of the hemagglutinin formation. No Ingavirin resistant mutants were isolated after the virus repeated subcultures in the presence of the increasing drug concentrations in the MDCK cell culture. In the experiment with multiple contamination by 0.01 CPD50/ml, the Ingavirin antiviral activity was detectable when the drug was administered 60 and even 90 min after the adsorption.
