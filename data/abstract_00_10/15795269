The role of dendritic cells (DC) in the initiation of immune responses against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is poorly understood. We analyzed the innate response of freshly isolated swine skin DC to the virus and show a rapid induction of beta interferon (IFN-beta) mRNA but not IFN-alpha mRNA. However, these DC secreted both IFN-alpha and IFN-beta proteins in response to live virus but not killed virus. Furthermore, the surface expression of swine major histocompatibility complex class II (SLA II) or CD80/CD86 molecules and antigen processing functions were not affected by FMDV exposure. Given the demonstrated sensitivity of FMDV to IFN-alpha/beta, there was no productive or nonproductive infection of these cells. Finally, freshly isolated skin DC constitutively expressed intracellular IFN-alpha protein in the absence of stimulation, with no detectable secretion of the cytokine until virus exposure. In situ analysis of these DC showed that these cells express and store IFN-alpha in uninfected animals. This is the first demonstration of the constitutive expression of IFN-alpha in resident, tissue-derived DC and indicates that skin DC can play an important role in the innate immune response of swine to viral infections.
