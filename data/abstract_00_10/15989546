Resistance to multiple drugs in medically important bacteria results in therapeutic challenges for the clinician. The mechanisms by which bacteria evade the effects of antimicrobial agents are many, but in recent years it has become apparent that efflux is a significant means of resistance and probably explains the intrinsic resistance to numerous drugs observed in species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Drug efflux is mediated by membrane-based hydrophobic proteins belonging to several distinct families, the members of which are related by structural characteristics, mechanism of action and energy source for the transport process. The multi-drug efflux transporters are particularly problematic as they are capable of extruding numerous structurally dissimilar drugs. Inhibition of these pumps, and even those with more limited substrate specificity, has been shown to decrease intrinsic resistance, reverse acquired resistance and reduce the emergence of mutants with higher-level target-based mutational resistance. Combining broad spectrum efflux pump inhibitors with current drugs that are pump substrates can recover clinically relevant activity of those compounds and thus may reduce the need for the discovery and development of new antimicrobial agents that are not pump substrates. Additional effort toward the identification, characterisation and determination of the clinical utility of efflux pump inhibitors is warranted.
