A number of Zn(II)- phthalocyanines bearing peripheral substituents of cationic nature due to the presence of quaternarized anilinium or ammonium groups were shown to be efficient photoantimicrobial agents: a 4-5 log decrease in the survival of both wild-type or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was obtained upon short irradiation times in the presence of phthalocyanine concentrations as low as 0.1 microM. A careful selection of the experimental protocol, and in particular the use of short (5 min) incubation times and mild irradiation parameters, allowed one to achieve a high selectivity of S. aureus photoinactivation as compared with important constituents of potential host tissues, such as human fibroblasts and keratinocytes. The efficiency and selectivity of the photoprocess were not affected by the presence of 5% human serum.
