Detoxification is essential for the fungal growth in the drug stress environments, and the multidrug transporters play an important role in this process. Here a cerulenin transporter gene (MpMdt, AB206476) was identified from Monascus pilosus. MpMdt mRNA contains 1951 bp and encodes a protein of 559 amino acid residues with 11 trans-membrane domains; and there is no difference in the sequence of MpMdt mRNA between the wild type M. pilosus IFO4520 and its cerulenin resistant mutant MK-1. Up-expression of MpMdt renders the cerulenin resistance of the mutant MK-1. Over-expression of MpMdt could also increase the cerulenin tolerance in the transgenic M. pilosus IFO4520. These results suggested that MpMdt is able to efflux-transport the anti-fungal antibiotic cerulenin and increase the cerulenin resistance of M. pilosus.
