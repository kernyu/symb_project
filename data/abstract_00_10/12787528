There has been a resurgence in tuberculosis (TB) worldwide. Approximately 2 billion people have latent infection, 8 million would develop active TB annually, and 2-3 million would die due to TB. With this resurgence, cases with extrapulmonary TB have also shown an increase. Approximately 10-11% of extrapulmonary TB involves joints and bones, which is approximately 1-3% of all TB cases. The global prevalence of latent joint and bone TB is approximately 19-38 million.TB arthritis most commonly manifests as a monoarthritis of weight-bearing joints in the hip or the knee. Oligo- or polyarticular presentation is not rare and may cause diagnostic confusion with inflammatory arthritis. Owing to the low incidence in developed countries, the diagnosis of joint and bone TB is often delayed. A high degree of sensitivity to this diagnosis would prevent delays, permitting prompt institution of anti-TB therapy and preventing irreversible joint damage. Despite advances, confirmation of diagnosis still relies on lengthy microbiological techniques or invasive biopsy. Due to the frequency of isoniazid resistance, initial treatment at present typically includes a combination of four drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and streptomycin or ethambutol. Antimicrobial therapy should be of at least 9 months duration, longer in children and immunocompromised hosts. Surgical procedures should be restricted to joints with severe cartilage destruction, large abscesses, joint deformity, multiple drug resistance or atypical mycobacteria.
