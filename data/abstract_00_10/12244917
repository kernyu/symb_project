Malarone (atovaquone-proguanil) is a new option now available to French clinicians for prophylaxis and treatment of malaria. Administered by the oral route, malarone is almost 100% effective with few side effects. It is indicated for chemoprophylaxis in travelers entering areas with chloraquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. Compliance with prophylactic treatment is enhanced by the low frequency of adverse effects and the need to continue chemoprophylaxis for only 7 days after leaving the endemic area. For curative treatment of malaria, malarone is especially useful in patients with uncomplicated forms of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This drug combination is also suitable as a stand-by treatment.
