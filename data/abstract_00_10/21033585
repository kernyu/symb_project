Thirty nine isolates of Escherichia coli, twenty two isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and sixteen isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infected patients were analyzed by antimicrobial susceptibility typing and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution and E Test methods. From the antibiotic susceptibility, ten patterns were recorded (four for E. coli, three for K. pneumoniae and three for P. aeruginosa respectively). Furthermore, genotyping showed seventeen RAPD patterns (seven for E. coli, five for K. pneumoniae and five for P. aeruginosa respectively). In this study, differentiation of strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa from nosocomial infection was possible with the use of RAPD.
