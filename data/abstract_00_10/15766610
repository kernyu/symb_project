This study examined the ability of commercial dry-form broth microdilution panels (Sensititre, TREK Diagnostics, Cleveland, OH) to produce accurate minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results for gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone. Reproducibility for gemifloxacin was 100.0% for on-scale values within +/-1 log2 dilution for same- and between-day comparisons. Newer comparator fluoroquinolones (sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin, and moxifloxacin) also showed excellent reproducibility (100.0%) for on-scale results analyzed at +/-1 log2 dilution for same- and between-day comparisons. Newer and investigational fluoroquinolone agents, including gemifloxacin, can be tested with confidence using these dry-form MIC panels.
