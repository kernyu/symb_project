AIM: To study in a sequential prospective trial, the effect of cheese consumption on the emergence of Escherichia coli and enterococci resistance to amoxicillin after amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amoxiclav) treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study comprised two phases separated by 1 year. Each phase lasted 75 days for each volunteer (from day -13 to day 61). During the first phase, 18 healthy volunteers were given a 1-g dose of amoxiclav orally twice a day for 5 days (from day 0 to day 4). The design of phase 2 was identical to that of phase 1, except that the volunteers consumed 100 g of hard-cooked cheese from day -6 to day 19. Faecal samples were collected 20 times throughout the trial and were quantitatively assayed for total and amoxicillin-resistant (Amox(R)) E. coli and enterococci. The consumption of experimental cheese was associated with a decrease of Amox(R) enterococci during the post-antibiotic period, with the maximum level of Amox(R) enterococci falling from 6.2% to 0.03%. This effect was not observed for E. coli, and the type of cheese (raw milk vs pasteurized milk) did not influence the results. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of cheese during amoxiclav treatment reduces the emergence of Amox(R) enterococci in faeces. SIGNIFICANCE AND CLINICAL IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our clinical pilot trial suggests that there are likely to be benefits from consuming probiotic-containing cheese during antibiotic treatment.
