To determine whether a multihospital Clostridium difficile outbreak was associated with epidemic strains and whether use of particular fluoroquinolones was associated with increased infection rates, we cultured feces from C. difficile-infected patients. Use of fluoroquionolones with enhanced antianaerobic activity was not associated with increased infection rates.
