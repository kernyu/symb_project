Twenty-three isolates of group A streptococci (GAS) recovered from population-based invasive GAS surveillance in the United States were erythromycin resistant, inducibly clindamycin resistant, and lacked known macrolide resistance determinants. These 23 isolates, representing four different clones, contained a broad-host-range plasmid carrying the erm(T) methylase gene, which has not been detected in GAS previously.
