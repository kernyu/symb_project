This study reports the antibiotic resistance patterns of coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) isolated from a drinking water treatment plant (WTP), a drinking water distribution network, responsible for supplying water to the consumers (WDN), and a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), responsible for receiving and treating domestic residual effluents. Genotyping and the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated a higher diversity of species both in the WTP (6 species/19 isolates) and WWTP (12 species/47 isolates) than in the WDN (6 species/172 isolates). Staphylococcus pasteuri and Staphylococcus epidermidis prevailed in the WTP and WDN and Staphylococcus saprophyticus in the WWTP. Staphylococci with reduced susceptibility (resistance or intermediary phenotype) to beta-lactams, tetracycline, clindamycin and erythromycin were observed in all types of water and belonged to the three major species groups. The highest resistance rate was found against erythromycin, presumably due to the presence of the efflux pump encoded by the determinant msrA, detected in the majority of the resistant isolates. This study demonstrates that antibiotic resistant CNS may colonize different types of water, namely drinking water fulfilling all the quality standards.
