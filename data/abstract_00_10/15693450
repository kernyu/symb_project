INTRODUCTION: Resistance of Helicobacter pylori to antibiotics may be particularly high in parts of the tropics. Infection may prove difficult to eradicate in such situations, and there is some evidence of benefit in increasing the duration of treatment (triple therapy) from 1 week to 2 or 3 weeks. AIM: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of 1 week versus 2 weeks of triple therapy for eradication of H. pylori in a Sri Lankan population. METHODS: Eighty two patients aged 18-70 years with gastritis or peptic ulcer and testing positive for H. pylori infection were randomly allocated to two treatment groups. Both groups received omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg, and tinidazole 500 mg. Group A (n = 42) received the trial medication twice daily for 1 week and the Group B (n = 40) twice daily for 2 weeks. H. pylori eradication was defined as a negative 14C labelled urea breath test at 2 weeks after completion of the therapy. RESULTS: H. pylori infection was eradicated in 36 (85.7%) patients in Group A and 36 (90%) patients in Group B (p = 0.9). Twenty three (55%) patients in Group A and 17 (43%) in Group B reported adverse effects attributable to trial medication (p = 0.387); none were serious. Three (7.5%) patients in Group B discontinued treatment due to adverse events that developed on days 7, 9 and 10. CONCLUSION: Twice daily treatment with clarithromycin, tinidazole, and omeprazole for 1 week is well tolerated and provides as good a rate of H. pylori eradication as 2-week therapy in Sri Lankan patients.
