Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces a large variety of virulence factors and is characterized by its capacity to rapidly develop resistance when exposed to antibiotics. In order to evaluate a possible correlation between acquired resistance to antibiotics and virulence, we examined the virulence of four isogenic variants of P. aeruginosa O12 that differ in their resistance phenotypes to various beta-lactam antibiotics in a mouse model of acute pneumonia. Strains overproducing a chromosomal type 1 beta-lactamase were less virulent in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed animals. Whereas the production of the exopolysaccharide alginate was similar between the four strains, extracellular virulence factors (elastase, rhamnolipid) that are controlled by the cell-to-cell signaling system circuit were detected in reduced amounts in the supernatant of the two isolates overproducing type 1 beta-lactamase. These results suggest that strains overexpressing the chromosomal type 1 beta-lactamase could be less virulent because of a reduction of cell-to-cell signaling dependent virulence factor production.
