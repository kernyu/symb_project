This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus (TAC) in children with SRNS. The study group comprised of 22 consecutive children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) who were studied prospectively. TAC was initiated with a dose of 0.10 mg/kg/day, and the dose was increased to attain a trough level of 5.0-10.0 g/l. These patients were treated with concomitant prednisone, which was subsequently tapered off and stopped. The primary outcome variable was the number of patients who attained a complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR). The mean age of onset was 7.33 +/- 5.9 years, and there were 20 boys and 2 girls. Of the 22 children, 9 had minimal change disease, 11 had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and the other 2 had diffuse mesangial hypercellularity on histopathology. TAC had to be withdrawn in 3 children because of its side effects. Of the remaining 19 children who received adequate therapy and were able to achieve target levels, CR was seen in 16 (84%) children, 2 (10.5%) attained PR and 1 was nonresponsive. The mean time to achieve remission was 63.2 +/- 44 days and the mean dose of TAC was 0.18 +/- 0.07 mg/kg. The mean urine spot protein/creatinine ratios were significantly lower (0.33 +/- 0.58 vs. 13.5 +/- 21.9 mg/mg, p = 0.002) and the mean serum albumin levels were significantly higher (3.92 +/- 0.35 g/dl vs. 2.39 +/- 0.56 g/dl, p = 0.00005), as compared to those prior to starting TAC. The mean glomerular filtration rate values at the end of the study were similar to those prior to starting TAC (97.9 +/- 21.2 ml/min/1.73 m(2) vs. 96.4 +/- 18.4 ml/min/1.73 m(2), p = 0.30). The mean duration of follow-up was 290 +/- 126 days. This is the largest study so far on the safety and efficacy of TAC therapy in SRNS. Our results suggest that TAC is an effective therapeutic modality for SRNS, including the subgroup of children who are nonresponsive to the current therapeutic modalities like cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine.
