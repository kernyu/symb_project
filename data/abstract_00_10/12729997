This investigation tested the mutation prevention concentration (MPC) concept using imipenem, meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ertapenem against three strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (PCN MIC = 0.012, 1, 8 mg/L, respectively). MIC, MBC, and MPC values for each of the beta-lactams did not differ by more than one tube dilution. While an interesting concept, MPC may not apply to antimicrobials that do not utilize a dual targeting system, such as beta-lactams, or to bacteria that exhibit multiple mechanisms of resistance and/or mutate at a rate where the frequency would likely be captured by the standard inoculum size used in routine MIC testing.
