The lsa gene confers intrinsic resistance to lincosamides and streptogramins A in Enterococcus faecalis, probably by active efflux. The lsa-like genes of two clinical isolates of E. faecalis susceptible to lincosamides and dalfopristin contained mutations that produced premature termination codons. Revertant mutants were obtained by selection on agar plates containing clindamycin.
