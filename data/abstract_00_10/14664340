The effects of ten commercially available disinfectants on virulence associated properties of Plesiomonas shigelloides were tested. All the disinfectants tested contained quaternary ammonium salts. The majority of the disinfectants when used at subinhibitory concentrations increased surface hydrophobicity as evaluated by bacterial adherence to xylene and decreased bacterial motility in a concentration dependent manner. Disinfectants did not significantly affect lipase activity. However, more than half of the antimicrobials tested increased the resistance of bacteria to hydrogen peroxide. The disinfectants, in a similar manner to antibiotics at concentrations below MIC, interfered with potential virulence factors of Plesiomonas shigelloides.
