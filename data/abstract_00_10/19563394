A total of 99 clinical isolates of metallo-ss-lactamase-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected in Japan between 1998 and 2001 were studied for their susceptibilities to carbapenem agents and corresponding oprD gene mutations. The OprD sequence of each strain was grouped into two major classes, based on the pattern of alterations. Eighty strains (80.8%) were so-called 'full length type', whose OprD proteins were fully encoded. The remaining 19 strains (19.2%) were so-called 'defective type', which possessed deletions or major alterations that might cause conformational changes in the OprD porin protein. The changes in 'defective type' strains led to 15-, 17- and 23-fold increases in the geometric mean MIC for imipenem, meropenem and biapenem compared with 'full length type' strains, respectively. 'Full length type' strains were further classified into six carbapenem susceptible types with the exception of four carbapenem-resistant subtypes with additional amino acid substitutions at D43, G183, R154, G314, G316. However, 'defective type' strains were classified into four types as follows: 10 strains which contained a stop codon within the coding region; six strains which contained IS; one strain with a short deletion near the C-terminal domain; and two strains without a stop codon in the sequenced region. Western blot analysis using OprD antibody showed that binding abilities of OprD proteins against 'full length type' strains were normal, whereas those against 'defective type' strains were lost without exception. These results indicate that OprD structure and antimicrobial activities for carbapenem agents proved to be highly correlated in P. aeruginosa.
