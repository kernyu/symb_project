The sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine in vitro was investigated in patients admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Thailand, between September 2001 and May 2002. Of 42 isolates, 34 were successfully tested for parasite sensitivity to chloroquine in vitro; the results showed a significant decrease in sensitivity compared with data published in 1989 and 1995: the IC50 and IC90 were 187.2 and 1217.9 ng/mL blood, respectively, an approximate 4-fold decrease in sensitivity in comparison with other data from the past 2 decades. A number of in vitro tests were performed simultaneously using both WHO microplates and our own laboratory-prepared pre-dosed microplates under the same conditions and there was no significant difference between the results.
