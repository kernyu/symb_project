Laboratory practice in the preanalytical phase of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was evaluated in 102 hospital, reference, physician office-clinic, and public health laboratories in Washington state. Surveys were sent to evaluate (i) use of NCCLS/CLSI (formerly NCCLS) AST performance standards, (ii) technical competence in AST case studies, challenging knowledge of contemporary testing issues, and (iii) choice of antimicrobial agents to test for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Numerous deficiencies were identified in the survey: (i) initially only 40% of the laboratories surveyed used current NCCLS/CLSI AST performance standards, (ii) the rate of accurate responses for three different case studies ranged from 29% to 69%, and (iii) variation was noted in the choice of antimicrobials tested against invasive isolates of S. pneumoniae. These deficiencies could affect therapy and detection of antimicrobial resistance. Several educational programs were implemented to improve AST policies and practices, and a follow-up survey indicated that four intervention strategies were most effective: (i) regional technical workshops, (ii) National Laboratory Training Network teleconferences, (iii) use of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) CD-ROM on AST, and (iv) the CDC Multilevel Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Resource website. The interventions could be implemented more widely in the United States to improve AST knowledge and practices.
