The effector CD8(+) T cells recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I binding altered self-peptides expressed in tumour cells. Although the requirement for CD4(+) T helper type 1 (Th1) cells in regulating CD8(+) T cells has been documented, their target epitopes and functional impact in antitumour responses remain unclear. We examined whether a potent immunogenic peptide of Mycobacterium tuberculosis eliciting Th1 immunity contributes to the generation of CD8(+) T cells and to protective antitumour immune responses to unrelated tumour-specific antigens. Peptide-25, a major Th epitope of Ag85B from M. tuberculosis preferentially induced CD4(+) Th1 cells in C57BL/6 mice and had an augmenting effect on Th1 generation for coimmunized unrelated antigenic peptides. Coimmunization of mice with Peptide-25 and ovalbumin (OVA) or Peptide-25 and B16 melanoma peptide [tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TRP-2)] for MHC class I led to a profound increase in CD8(+) T cells specific for OVA and TRP-2 peptides, respectively. This heightened response depended on Peptide-25-specific CD4(+) T cells and interferon-gamma-producing T cells. In tumour protection assays, immunization with Peptide-25 and OVA resulted in the enhancement of CD8(+) cytotoxic cell generation specific for OVA and the growth inhibition of EL-4 thymoma expressing OVA peptide leading to the tumour rejection. These phenomena were not achieved by immunization with OVA alone. Peptide-25-reactive Th1 cells counteractivated dendritic cells in the presence of Peptide-25 leading them to activate and present OVA peptide to CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells.
