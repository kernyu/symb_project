Highly active antirretroviral therapy has transformed the prognosis of patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The efficacy of these drugs has shifted the clinicians; attention to other therapeutic aspects like QD regimens, fixed dose combinations and clinical safety. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate(TDF) is a nucleoside monophosphate (nucleotide) analogue that inhibits reverse trascriptase enzyme. It's administered in a q.d. regimen and it's recommended by most of the clinical guidelines as a start regimen in combination with two other drugs. Currently more than 5 years of clinical experience is accumulated and confirmed that a combination of tenofovir and a nonnucleoside analogue transcriptase inhibitor is a comfortable, safe, highly effective and low pill burden regimen.
