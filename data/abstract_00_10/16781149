A novel sulfanyltriazole was discovered as an HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor via HTS using a cell-based assay. Chemical modifications and molecular modeling studies were carried out to establish its SAR and understand its interactions with the enzyme. These modifications led to the identification of sulfanyltriazoles with low nanomolar potency for inhibiting HIV-1 replication and promising activities against selected NNRTI resistant mutants. These novel and potent sulfanyltriazoles could serve as advanced leads for further optimization.
