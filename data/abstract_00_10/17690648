Growing resistance of bacteria to wide-spectrum antibiotics gave rise to a search for new approaches to antimicrobial therapy. Photodynamic therapy (PT) was proposed for fighting against infections. It combines effects of a photosensitiser and visible light. PT produces reactive oxygen species able to kill cells. High response to PT was achieved in the treatment of local infections, in particular, in the treatment of pyoinflammatory ENT diseases caused both by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, especially diseases caused by bacteria with antibiotic polyresistance.
