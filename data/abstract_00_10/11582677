Twenty-five patients with pyoinflammatory maxillofacial diseases treated in an inpatient setting in the Regional Dentistry Clinic of Krasnodar and 8 healthy volunteers were examined. After opening and draining of the purulent focus the patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 consisted of 21 patients treated by intravenous 0.04% sodium hypochlorite (SHC) and intravenous infusions of SHC-oxidized autoblood for 2-3 days. Group 2 (6 pts) was treated by intravenous infusions of SHC-oxidized autoblood for 6 days. The criteria of intoxication were erythrocyte resistance tests in hypotonic sodium chloride and at different concentrations of urea in isotonic medium. A new method for evaluating erythrogram deviations from reference values is proposed, which helps adequately assess the severity of intoxication.
