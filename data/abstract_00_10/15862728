OBJECTIVE: Correlations between probabilities of resistance and the frequencies with which antibiotics were prescribed for treating bacterial respiratory infections were examined in a nationwide ambulatory population. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The data of a nationwide probability sample survey of visits to physician offices in the United States in 1999 were used to conduct this study of drug use. A clinical pharmacologist identified antibiotics prescribed during those visits using a large online database. The participating physicians diagnosed the bacterial respiratory infections. An infectious disease expert determined the probabilities of bacterial resistance from a nationwide antibiotic surveillance database. RESULTS: Various bacterial respiratory infections were diagnosed during 6.5% of physician office visits in 1999. One or more antibiotics were prescribed during 51.0% of those visits. The probabilities of resistance to the most frequently prescribed antibiotics varied from 20% to 40% and showed a weak positive correlation with the frequencies of antibiotic prescriptions. CONCLUSION: A significant number of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions were issued for infections with a high probability of bacterial resistance to the prescribed antibiotics.
