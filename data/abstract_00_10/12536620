In 518 cases with urogenital tract infection detected with mycoplasma identification susceptibility testing reagent box, 308 cases (59.4%) were infected by ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu), 21 cases (4.1%) were infected by mycoplasma hominis (Mh), and 189 cases (36.5%) were infected by both Uu and Mh. Drug sensitivity to the macrolides (erythromycin, roxithromycin, josamycin, azithromycin), the tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocin), and the quinolines (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) were detected at the same time. The results showed that the sensitivity to various antibiotics in Uu infection was different from that in Mh infection. Macrolides were more sensitive for Uu infection, and quinolines were more sensitive for Mh infection, while the mixed infection of Mh and Uu had resistance to most antibiotics.
