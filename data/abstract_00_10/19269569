Staphylococcus aureus represents a public health challenge worldwide. The aim of this study was the characterization of different food isolates of S. aureus on the basis of their production of enterotoxins, hemolysins and resistance to antibiotics. A total of 148 coagulase-positive staphylococcal strains isolated from different food origins were identified to the species level. By multiplex PCR, 69% of the isolates were shown to be enterotoxigenic (SEs); the most common were sea seg, sea seg sei and seg sei. According to CLSI [CLSI, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2007. Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing; Fifteenth Informational Supplement. CLSI document M100-S15. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, Wayne, PA], 38% of the isolates were resistant to oxacillin (>or= 6 microg/mL; MRSA positives) but only 0.68% showed the presence of mecA gene. 70 and 73% of the S. aureus strains were resistant to beta-lactams, ampicillin and penicillin, respectively. The virulence pattern was demonstrated to be origin and strain dependent. These findings emphasise the need to prevent the presence of S. aureus strains and SEs production in foods.
