BACKGROUND: This review describes the use of antibiotics and the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in animal husbandry, with emphasis on the current situation in Norway. The clinically most important resistance problems in human medicine that are associated with antimicrobial resistance in animals, are discussed in a global perspective. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review is based on a Pubmed search with the terms "animal" and "antimicrobial resistance", as well as the authors' own research experience. RESULTS: Antibiotic use in animals is the main cause for selection and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in animals. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in animal husbandry in Norway is lower than that in many non-Nordic countries, and is associated with less use of therapeutic antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance may spread from animals to humans by transfer of resistant bacteria from animals to humans and resistance genes from animal bacteria to human pathogens. INTERPRETATION: It is adamant to have efficient prevention measures and rational use of antibiotics in animals to delay development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Although good examples exist of how resistance in animal bacteria can create problems for human health, it is well documented that the human use of therapeutic antibiotics and lack of efficient infection control measures have the most profound influence on the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in humans.
