Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem worldwide in both the hospital and community settings. Various approaches have been proposed and tested mainly in the hospital environment to reduce this problem; however, few of these have been examined from the perspective of applicability to reversing community-based resistance. It is clear that, in addition to specific antibiotic usage campaigns, a major educational initiative for both prescribers and patients alike is required for the full societal impact of growing antibiotic resistance to be appreciated. This inexorable increase is occurring in the face of a dearth of new antibiotics for community use and even fewer for treating resistant nosocomial gram-negative species. The possible strategies and consequences are discussed.
