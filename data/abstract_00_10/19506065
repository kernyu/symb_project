The antibacterial spectrum of besifloxacin, a novel fluoroquinolone recently approved for treatment of ocular infections, was studied using 2,690 clinical isolates representing 40 species. Overall, besifloxacin was the most potent agent tested against gram-positive pathogens and anaerobes and was generally equivalent to comparator fluoroquinolones in activity against most gram-negative pathogens. Besifloxacin demonstrated potent, broad-spectrum activity, which was particularly notable against gram-positive and gram-negative isolates that were resistant to other fluoroquinolones and classes of antibacterial agents.
