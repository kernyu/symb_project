Group B streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae) is still of great relevance in the perinatal period, although maternal antimicrobial prophylaxis has significantly reduced the rate of culture-confirmed invasive infection in neonates. This strategy, however, raises considerable concern because preterm delivery or late-onset sepsis cannot be prevented, and antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide. Several advances in the development of conjugate vaccines and in research on virulence factors and pathways involved in the immune response to group B streptococcus have been accomplished, some of which might reach clinical practice in the near future.
