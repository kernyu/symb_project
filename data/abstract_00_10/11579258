Genotypic resistance to antiretroviral drugs was examined in 684 individuals attending 18 outpatient clinics distributed across Spain in June 2000. Compared with similar surveys conducted before 1998, the prevalence of resistance to nucleosides has declined significantly among naive chronic HIV carriers. In contrast, resistance among pre-treated patients has increased; resistance to all three drug families having been recognized in nearly a quarter of patients.
