We report a case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M1 showing a 48,XY,+13,+13 karyotype. Treatment was according to the Medical Research Council AML14 trial protocol with two courses of DAT chemotherapy. Postchemotherapy bone marrow examination failed to show complete remission or cytogenetic normalization. Despite having resistant disease, the patient initially remained clinically well although requiring regular blood transfusions for anemia. However his leukocyte count gradually increased and he became symptomatic. He was treated subsequently with FLAG but died approximately 2 weeks later, 6 months after first presenting. Tetrasomy 13 as the sole cytogenetic abnormality has not been reported previously in M1 AML and has only been reported in three other AML cases, all with an immature phenotype and poor outcome.
