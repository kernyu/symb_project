Candida albicans, a medically important opportunistic yeast is described as the etiologic agent of stomatitis in dogs. The oral swabs collected from 34 dogs showing symptoms of stomatitis or gingivitis such as anorexia, halitosis, bleeding within the oral cavity, dysphagia, ptyalism (salivation) and submandibular lymphadenopathy were cultured for isolation of the causative agent. C. albicans was isolated from four (11.8%) dogs. The isolates were sensitive to clotrimazole, fluconazole and amphotericin-B but were resistant to nystatin. The routine application of Pal's sunflower seed medium and Narayan stain in microbiological laboratories is highly emphasized. It is recommended that the role of C. albicans, as the etiologic agent of canine stomatitis, should be carefully investigated in various clinical related disorders of dogs as well as in other animals.
