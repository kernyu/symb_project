In IL-5 transgenic mice (C3H/HeN-TgN(IL-5)-Imeg), in which 50% of peripheral blood leukocytes are eosinophils, the development of infection by Leishmania amazonensis was clearly suppressed. To determine mechanistically how this protozoan parasite is killed, we performed in vitro killing experiments. Either IL-4 or IFN-gamma effectively stimulated eosinophils to kill Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes, and most of the killing was inhibited by catalase but not by the NO inhibitor L-N5-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine, suggesting that hydrogen peroxide is responsible for the killing of L. amazonensis by eosinophils. There was no significant degranulation of eosinophils in the culture, because eosinophil peroxidase was not detected in culture supernatants when L. amazonensis promastigotes were killed by activated eosinophils. Such resistance was also observed in BALB/c mice, which are highly susceptible to L. amazonensis. Expression plasmids for IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-gamma were transferred into muscle by electroporation in vivo starting 1 week before infection. Expression plasmid for IL-5 was most effective in slowing the development of infection among three expression plasmids. Expression plasmid for IL-4 was slightly effective and that for IFN-gamma had no effect on the progress of disease. These results suggest that IL-5 gene transfer into muscle by electroporation is useful as a supplementary protection method against L. amazonensis infection.
